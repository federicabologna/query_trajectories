The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake [4]. Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake [17]. The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells [30]. The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells [31]. Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm [32]; LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection [33]. \n\nAlternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation. In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

Crist, S. Stern\n## Abstract\nThe earliest example of in vivo expression of exogenous mRNA is by direct intramuscular injection in mice without the aid of a delivery vehicle. The current state of the art for therapeutic nucleic acid delivery is lipid nanoparticles (LNP), which are composed of cholesterol, a helper lipid, a PEGylated lipid and an ionizable amine-containing lipid. The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous administration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutaneous routes. Delivery of nucleic acid to hepatocytes by LNP has therapeutic potential, but there are many disease indications that would benefit from non-hepatic LNP tissue and cell population targeting, such as cancer, and neurological, cardiovascular and infectious diseases. This review will concentrate on the current efforts to develop the next generation of tissue-targeted LNP constructs for therapeutic nucleic acids.\n## Inherent LNP Liver Tropism\nAlthough reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1). The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake [4]. Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake [17]. The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells [30]. The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells [31]. Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm [32]; LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection [33]. \n\nAlternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation.

LNPs accumulated broadly across these cell types, though functional mRNA delivery was notably higher in liver endothelial cells than in Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. Liver endothelial cells, with their distinctive discontinuous vasculature, act as a gateway, allowing LNPs to extravasate into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes and other liver cells. Notably, endothelial cell subtypes, for example, CD32High (central venous zone) and CD32Low (periportal zone), showed different interactions with LNPs, with CD32Low cells exhibiting higher accumulation. This spatial distribution and receptor expression in liver endothelial cells influenced LNP uptake and processing, which in turn impacted biodistribution and functional delivery (Figure 3). 0][51] As part of the fibrotic matrix in liver disease, they may also influence how LNPs interact with the immune system. 34",

                    "text": "ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids. Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23",

The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

                    "text": "2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17",

For example, clodronate liposomes are used to selectively target macrophages, resulting in their depletion. [40] Hepatocytes are the main parenchymal cells of the liver, responsible for liver-specific metabolic functions, including the synthesis of proteins (e.g., albumin), detoxification, and lipid metabolism. Because of interactions with LDL receptors, these cells are highly permeable to LNPs, especially those smaller than 100 nm in diameter. ApoE-coated LNPs bind to LDL receptors and allow LNP uptake into hepatocytes. 23 The heterogeneity of hepatocytes is also remarkable; they exhibit zonation across the liver acinus, with different metabolic roles depending on their location. 34 Hepatocyte zonation influences LNP behavior. Zone 1 (periportal) hepatocytes perform oxidative metabolism, while Zone 3 (pericentral) hepatocytes specialize in detoxification and lipid metabolism. Zone 3 hepatocytes enhance ApoE-mediated LNP uptake through higher LDL receptor expression. 23 Smaller LNPs (<100 nm) use the fenestrations in LSECs to target Zone 3, while the proximity of Zone 1 to blood flow facilitates rapid uptake. 30,31 Therapeutic designs should consider the specific functions of hepatocyte zonation: for example, targeting Zone 3 for detoxification therapies due to its role in lipid and xenobiotic detoxification, and Zone 1 for metabolic disorders because of its focus on oxidative metabolism. 41 Moreover, variations in ploidy among hepatocytes are vital in their spatial and functional specialization. This adds another dimension to the complexity of liver zonation, shaping critical metabolic processes, for example, lipid metabolism and the clearance of nanoparticles. 34,42 ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids.",

Understanding of biodistribution and liver-specific tropism\n# Venue: Molecular Therapy: Methods & Clinical Development\n# Authors: M. Hosseini-Kharat, K. Bremmell, C. Prestidge\n## Abstract\nNone\n## INTRODUCTION\n2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17\n\n## INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LIVER CELL TYPES AND LNPs\nDepletion of Kupffer cells to minimize liver sequestration and enhance nanoparticle circulation to target tissues. For example, clodronate liposomes are used to selectively target macrophages, resulting in their depletion. [40] Hepatocytes are the main parenchymal cells of the liver, responsible for liver-specific metabolic functions, including the synthesis of proteins (e.g., albumin), detoxification, and lipid metabolism. Because of interactions with LDL receptors, these cells are highly permeable to LNPs, especially those smaller than 100 nm in diameter. ApoE-coated LNPs bind to LDL receptors and allow LNP uptake into hepatocytes. 23 The heterogeneity of hepatocytes is also remarkable; they exhibit zonation across the liver acinus, with different metabolic roles depending on their location. 34 Hepatocyte zonation influences LNP behavior. Zone 1 (periportal) hepatocytes perform oxidative metabolism, while Zone 3 (pericentral) hepatocytes specialize in detoxification and lipid metabolism. Zone 3 hepatocytes enhance ApoE-mediated LNP uptake through higher LDL receptor expression. 23 Smaller LNPs (<100 nm) use the fenestrations in LSECs to target Zone 3, while the proximity of Zone 1 to blood flow facilitates rapid uptake. 30,31 Therapeutic designs should consider the specific functions of hepatocyte zonation: for example, targeting Zone 3 for detoxification therapies due to its role in lipid and xenobiotic detoxification, and Zone 1 for metabolic disorders because of its focus on oxidative metabolism. 41 Moreover, variations in ploidy among hepatocytes are vital in their spatial and functional specialization. This adds another dimension to the complexity of liver zonation, shaping critical metabolic processes, for example, lipid metabolism and the clearance of nanoparticles. 34,42 ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids.\n...\nECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids. Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23\n...\nFinally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23 Given their high endocytic capacity and strategic location in liver sinusoids, LSECs are essential to the liver's clearance of circulating LNPs. \n\nSago et al. 32 investigated how specific liver cell subtypes-Kupffer cells, liver endothelial cells, and hepatocytes-interacted with LNPs. LNPs accumulated broadly across these cell types, though functional mRNA delivery was notably higher in liver endothelial cells than in Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. Liver endothelial cells, with their distinctive discontinuous vasculature, act as a gateway, allowing LNPs to extravasate into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes and other liver cells. Notably, endothelial cell subtypes, for example, CD32High (central venous zone) and CD32Low (periportal zone), showed different interactions with LNPs, with CD32Low cells exhibiting higher accumulation. This spatial distribution and receptor expression in liver endothelial cells influenced LNP uptake and processing, which in turn impacted biodistribution and functional delivery (Figure 3). 0][51] As part of the fibrotic matrix in liver disease, they may also influence how LNPs interact with the immune system. 34\n\n## ANALYSIS OF LIVER-TARGETED LNP STUDIES\nKey examples from the literature on liver-targeting LNPs are summarized in Table 2. The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

                    "text": "Another important physical parameter that contributes to the nanoparticle passive targeting of the liver, especially at the cellular level, is surface charge. While cationic nanoparticles have shown greater safety and biocompatibility concerns due to their strong membrane permeability and binding of negatively charged DNA, deviations towards either a positive or negative surface charge have shown significant effects on particle-cell interactions [35,36]. Highly cationic or anionic nanoparticles, for example, adsorb a significant amount of serum protein, resulting in aggregation and increased uptake by macrophages in vitro [37]. Kupffer cells and LSECs have also been shown to preferentially bind and clear negatively charged nanoparticles through interactions with scavenger receptors, such as stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 [38,39]. Conversely, hepatocytes demonstrate significant uptake of positively charged NPs over negatively charged ones [39]. The desired zeta potential for enhanced and targeted membrane interactions can be achieved either through material selection of choice, as in the case of many ionizable lipids, or chemical modifications [40]. However, it is important to note that protein binding to, e.g., albumin, formation of protein coronas, and interactions with phagocytes can change the synthetically given surface charge in vivo and subsequently influence liver cellular uptake [29,41]. Therefore, despite the role that electrostatic binding plays in liver uptake, the interplay is complex between the nanoparticles' different characteristics that ultimately determine their activity.",

                    "text": "Specific liver-residing cells also display particle size preferences due to the impact of size on cellular internalization rates and mechanisms. For example, LSECs have been shown to engulf particles with a diameter of up to 200 nm due to their internalization method of receptor-mediated endocytosis [24,25]. This upper size limit is shown to facilitate intracellular accumulation in late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, an important mechanism for immunomodulation, within other non-phagocytic cells [25]. On the other hand, Kupffer cells, which can also utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis, preferentially uptake particles > 200 nm in the liver due to their phagocytic activity [25,26]. This creates a well-controlled dichotomy that makes up most of the liver's scavenger function. To access other liver cells, such as hepatocytes and HSCs, penetration through the liver sinusoidal fenestrae via the space of Diss\u00e9 may require minimization of nanoparticle size, ideally to <100 nm [27]. However, it has been shown that nanoparticles up to 400 nm have been able to extravasate into the space of Diss\u00e9 with a proper lipid composition of negatively charged phosphatidylserine [28]. \n\nRegarding shape, spherical nanoparticles are the most common particle shape and are shown to have some preferential accumulation in the lungs, liver, and spleen [21]. Most studies have additionally shown increased phagocytosis of spherical nanoparticles by macrophages compared to elongated ones [29]. PEG-bl-PPS micelle nanoparticles, for example, were shown to preferentially target liver phagocytes compared to more elongated fillomicelle nanoparticles [30]. Contrastingly, however, cylindrical silicon-based nanoparticles showed nearly two times higher accumulation in the liver than their spherical counterparts [31]. Therefore, while there is a strong impact of size and shape on liver targeting and biodistribution, more research needs to be conducted to discern their specific targeting impact and the varying influence different nanoparticle compositions may have on such impact.",

Such an approach provides a versatile solution to the treatment of a diversity of immunologic diseases. In this review, we begin by assessing the design parameters integral to cell-specific targeting and the tolerogenic induction of nanoplatforms engineered to target the four critical immunogenic hepatic cells, including liver sinusoidal epithelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and hepatocytes. We also include an overview of multiple therapeutic strategies in which nanoparticles are being studied to treat many allergies and autoimmune disorders. Finally, we explore the challenges of using nanoparticles in this field while highlighting future avenues to expand the therapeutic utility of liver-targeting nanoparticles in autoimmune processes.",

                    "text": "Nanoparticle size, for example, has demonstrated a significant impact on targeting since anatomical access to hepatocytes requires access to the space of Diss\u00e9 via small fenestrae and avoidance of liver reticuloendothelial cells, which sequester most liver-reaching nanoparticles [24]. Therefore, a proposed <100 nm diameter has been suggested [24,113]. Hepatocyte-targeting has also been achieved with nanoparticle coating and compositions. Cholesterol-TWEEN 80 unilamellar vesicles and lipopeptide cKK-E12 showed preferential uptake by hepatocytes over sinusoidal cells while cKK-E12 lipoprotein NPs displayed gene silencing selectivity in hepatocytes over nonliver organs, liver endothelial cells, and liver leukocytes [113,114]. Hepatocyte-specific ligands have also been difficult to identify (Figure 4D). The most popularly implemented is the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) due to its primary expression on hepatocytes, at ~1.8 million receptors/cell, and minimal expression on extrahepatic cells [14]. With a high affinity for N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), galactose (Gal), and glucose, ASGPR has been tested for targeting with these and modified versions of these ligands, such as asialofetuin-PEG residue and galactosylated chitosan [115][116][117]. However, because Kupffer cells also demonstrate Gal/GalNAc scavenging, they could divert nanoparticles intended for hepatocytes [14]. Although less specific, glycyrrhizin/glycyrrhetinic acid receptors found on hepatocyte membranes, as well as kidney, stomach, and colon cells have also been targeted [118]. Glycyrrhizin-modified chitosan NPs, for example, have shown preferential endocytosis by hepatocytes over hepatic non-parenchymal cells [119].",

Lam, Nathaniel Park, Austin Hyun, Emily Kusumoputro, Xiang Wang, Tian Xia\n## Abstract\nLiver-targeting nanoparticles have emerged as a promising platform for the induction of immune tolerance by taking advantage of the liver\u2019s unique tolerogenic properties and nanoparticles\u2019 physicochemical flexibility. Such an approach provides a versatile solution to the treatment of a diversity of immunologic diseases. In this review, we begin by assessing the design parameters integral to cell-specific targeting and the tolerogenic induction of nanoplatforms engineered to target the four critical immunogenic hepatic cells, including liver sinusoidal epithelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and hepatocytes. We also include an overview of multiple therapeutic strategies in which nanoparticles are being studied to treat many allergies and autoimmune disorders. Finally, we explore the challenges of using nanoparticles in this field while highlighting future avenues to expand the therapeutic utility of liver-targeting nanoparticles in autoimmune processes.\n## Size and Shape\nSpecific liver-residing cells also display particle size preferences due to the impact of size on cellular internalization rates and mechanisms. For example, LSECs have been shown to engulf particles with a diameter of up to 200 nm due to their internalization method of receptor-mediated endocytosis [24,25]. This upper size limit is shown to facilitate intracellular accumulation in late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, an important mechanism for immunomodulation, within other non-phagocytic cells [25]. On the other hand, Kupffer cells, which can also utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis, preferentially uptake particles > 200 nm in the liver due to their phagocytic activity [25,26]. This creates a well-controlled dichotomy that makes up most of the liver's scavenger function. To access other liver cells, such as hepatocytes and HSCs, penetration through the liver sinusoidal fenestrae via the space of Diss\u00e9 may require minimization of nanoparticle size, ideally to <100 nm [27]. However, it has been shown that nanoparticles up to 400 nm have been able to extravasate into the space of Diss\u00e9 with a proper lipid composition of negatively charged phosphatidylserine [28]. \n\nRegarding shape, spherical nanoparticles are the most common particle shape and are shown to have some preferential accumulation in the lungs, liver, and spleen [21]. Most studies have additionally shown increased phagocytosis of spherical nanoparticles by macrophages compared to elongated ones [29]. PEG-bl-PPS micelle nanoparticles, for example, were shown to preferentially target liver phagocytes compared to more elongated fillomicelle nanoparticles [30]. Contrastingly, however, cylindrical silicon-based nanoparticles showed nearly two times higher accumulation in the liver than their spherical counterparts [31]. Therefore, while there is a strong impact of size and shape on liver targeting and biodistribution, more research needs to be conducted to discern their specific targeting impact and the varying influence different nanoparticle compositions may have on such impact.\n\n## Surface Charge\nAnother important physical parameter that contributes to the nanoparticle passive targeting of the liver, especially at the cellular level, is surface charge. While cationic nanoparticles have shown greater safety and biocompatibility concerns due to their strong membrane permeability and binding of negatively charged DNA, deviations towards either a positive or negative surface charge have shown significant effects on particle-cell interactions [35,36]. Highly cationic or anionic nanoparticles, for example, adsorb a significant amount of serum protein, resulting in aggregation and increased uptake by macrophages in vitro [37]. Kupffer cells and LSECs have also been shown to preferentially bind and clear negatively charged nanoparticles through interactions with scavenger receptors, such as stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 [38,39]. Conversely, hepatocytes demonstrate significant uptake of positively charged NPs over negatively charged ones [39]. The desired zeta potential for enhanced and targeted membrane interactions can be achieved either through material selection of choice, as in the case of many ionizable lipids, or chemical modifications [40]. However, it is important to note that protein binding to, e.g., albumin, formation of protein coronas, and interactions with phagocytes can change the synthetically given surface charge in vivo and subsequently influence liver cellular uptake [29,41]. Therefore, despite the role that electrostatic binding plays in liver uptake, the interplay is complex between the nanoparticles' different characteristics that ultimately determine their activity.\n\n## Hepatocytes\nNanoparticle size, for example, has demonstrated a significant impact on targeting since anatomical access to hepatocytes requires access to the space of Diss\u00e9 via small fenestrae and avoidance of liver reticuloendothelial cells, which sequester most liver-reaching nanoparticles [24]. Therefore, a proposed <100 nm diameter has been suggested [24,113]. Hepatocyte-targeting has also been achieved with nanoparticle coating and compositions. Cholesterol-TWEEN 80 unilamellar vesicles and lipopeptide cKK-E12 showed preferential uptake by hepatocytes over sinusoidal cells while cKK-E12 lipoprotein NPs displayed gene silencing selectivity in hepatocytes over nonliver organs, liver endothelial cells, and liver leukocytes [113,114]. Hepatocyte-specific ligands have also been difficult to identify (Figure 4D). The most popularly implemented is the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) due to its primary expression on hepatocytes, at ~1.8 million receptors/cell, and minimal expression on extrahepatic cells [14]. With a high affinity for N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), galactose (Gal), and glucose, ASGPR has been tested for targeting with these and modified versions of these ligands, such as asialofetuin-PEG residue and galactosylated chitosan [115][116][117]. However, because Kupffer cells also demonstrate Gal/GalNAc scavenging, they could divert nanoparticles intended for hepatocytes [14]. Although less specific, glycyrrhizin/glycyrrhetinic acid receptors found on hepatocyte membranes, as well as kidney, stomach, and colon cells have also been targeted [118]. Glycyrrhizin-modified chitosan NPs, for example, have shown preferential endocytosis by hepatocytes over hepatic non-parenchymal cells [119].",

                    "text": "The mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15). Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.",

                    "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

Kim, M. Jeong, S. Hur, Y. Cho, J. Park, H. Jung, Y. Seo, H. Woo, K. Nam, K. Lee, H. Lee\n## Abstract\nEngineered ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed for the LSEC-specific delivery of RNA therapeutics. Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15). Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.\n...\nThe size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.\n\n## Active targeting of LSECs using ligand-incorporated LNPs\nUpon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

Hatakeyama, M. Hyodo, H. Harashima\n## Abstract\nWhile a variety of short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery compounds have been developed, a deep understanding of the key parameters that determine the quality of siRNA delivery are not known with certainty. Therefore, an understanding of the factors required for the efficient, selective, and safe delivery of siRNA is a great challenge for successful siRNA delivery. Herein, we report on the development of two pH-sensitive cationic lipids and their use in examining the impact of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value, lipase sensitivity and the size of lipid nanoparticles on the biodistribution, and efficiency and cell specificity of gene silencing in the liver. An increase in the pKa value resulted in a significant change in the intrahepatic localization of siRNA and gene-silencing efficiency in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The sensitivity of the pH-sensitive cationic lipid to lipases was a major factor in achieving hepatocyte-specific gene silencing. Increasing the particle size can improve the LSEC specificity of gene silencing. As a consequence, we succeeded in developing both a highly efficient, hepatocyte-specific formulation, and the most efficacious LSEC-targeted formulation reported to date. These findings will facilitate the development of more sophisticated siRNA delivery systems.\n",

Appropriate adjustments of the physicochemical features enable nanomedicines to enter liver cells in a passive-targeted manner, thereby increasing the accumulation of liver and reducing renal clearance and undesired distribution in other organs [24]. Particle size notably affects cell and tissue uptake. Liu et al. observed that nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm were rapidly cleared via renal filtration, resulting in low plaque accumulation [173]. In the liver, since the diameter of fenestrae in normal liver sinusoid endothelial cells is about 50-200 nm [174,175], nanoscaled particles with diameters < 200 nm can pass through sinusoids [170]. This is beneficial for nanoparticles to evade capture by Kupffer cells and reach hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells [24,176]. Nanoparticles with diameters > 400 nm can diffuse through the sinusoid endothelial fenestrations by forced extrusion, presumably owing to transient interaction with the sinusoidal endothelial cells [177]. As a result, particles with larger size are more likely to be phagocytized by Kupffer cells [178], especially 200-1000 nm [179], even microbubbles of ultrasound imaging with the diameters of 1-10 \u00b5m [180].\n\nNanoparticles with hydrophobic surface are readily identified by mononuclear phagocyte system and primarily captured by spleen and liver [181]. Moreover, they are quickly removed from the systemic circulation [182]. By contrast, nanoscaled particles with hydrophilic surface are hardly taken up by the mononuclear phagocyte system. The nanoparticles with hydrophilic properties can enhance their permeation and retention effects, thereby increasing the accumulation in liver [87].\n\nThe surface charge is also a factor that affects the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. Positively charged particles prefer to be internalized by hepatocyte [182,183], while Kupffer cells present a greater tendency to ingest nanoparticles",

Positively charged particles prefer to be internalized by hepatocyte [182,183], while Kupffer cells present a greater tendency to ingest nanoparticles with negative charges [4]. The proper cationic charge density of particles is necessary for greater membrane affinity and nucleic acid binding affinity [184,185]. However, in the blood circulation, serum proteins with negative charges are possibly adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, antibodies or complement proteins may also deposit on the surface, leading to poor serum stability [170]. The aggregates with the size over 200 nm and a larger negative surface charge will be eliminated by resident macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow [170,184,185]. Therefore, it is important to achieve a balance between cell internalization and serum stability. PEG decoration on the nanoparticle surface is one of the common methods to improve the stability of particles in blood circulation, which covers positive charge on the surface of polyplexes and minimizes serum protein binding [186]. In addition, zwitterionic polymers with anionic and cationic end groups also show outstanding resistance to undiscovered immunogenicity and non-specific protein adsorption, which has been considered as a potential alternative of PEG [187].\n\nAfter nanoparticles being administrated into blood circulation, the non-specific interactions between serum proteins and nanoparticles result in the formation of the protein corona which mediates the uptake of nontargeting nanoparticles in liver cells [24]. The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles determine the type of targeted hepatic cells. Non-targeted or unmodified nanomaterials are mainly absorbed by non-parenchymal cells in the liver, such as Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and hepatic stellate cells, predominantly capturing by Kupffer cells [112].\n\nKupffer cells are the resident macrophages of the liver, comprising ~ 35%",

Appropriate adjustments of the physicochemical features enable nanomedicines to enter liver cells in a passive-targeted manner, thereby increasing the accumulation of liver and reducing renal clearance and undesired distribution in other organs [24]. Particle size notably affects cell and tissue uptake. Liu et al. observed that nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm were rapidly cleared via renal filtration, resulting in low plaque accumulation [173]. In the liver, since the diameter of fenestrae in normal liver sinusoid endothelial cells is about 50-200 nm [174,175], nanoscaled particles with diameters < 200 nm can pass through sinusoids [170]. This is beneficial for nanoparticles to evade capture by Kupffer cells and reach hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells [24,176]. Nanoparticles with diameters > 400 nm can diffuse through the sinusoid endothelial fenestrations by forced extrusion, presumably owing to transient interaction with the sinusoidal endothelial cells [177]. As a result, particles with larger size are more likely to be phagocytized by Kupffer cells [178], especially 200-1000 nm [179], even microbubbles of ultrasound imaging with the diameters of 1-10 \u00b5m [180].\n\nNanoparticles with hydrophobic surface are readily identified by mononuclear phagocyte system and primarily captured by spleen and liver [181]. Moreover, they are quickly removed from the systemic circulation [182]. By contrast, nanoscaled particles with hydrophilic surface are hardly taken up by the mononuclear phagocyte system. The nanoparticles with hydrophilic properties can enhance their permeation and retention effects, thereby increasing the accumulation in liver [87].\n\nThe surface charge is also a factor that affects the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. Positively charged particles prefer to be internalized by hepatocyte [182,183], while Kupffer cells present a greater tendency to ingest nanoparticles\n...\nincreasing the accumulation in liver [87].\n\nThe surface charge is also a factor that affects the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. Positively charged particles prefer to be internalized by hepatocyte [182,183], while Kupffer cells present a greater tendency to ingest nanoparticles with negative charges [4]. The proper cationic charge density of particles is necessary for greater membrane affinity and nucleic acid binding affinity [184,185]. However, in the blood circulation, serum proteins with negative charges are possibly adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, antibodies or complement proteins may also deposit on the surface, leading to poor serum stability [170]. The aggregates with the size over 200 nm and a larger negative surface charge will be eliminated by resident macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow [170,184,185]. Therefore, it is important to achieve a balance between cell internalization and serum stability. PEG decoration on the nanoparticle surface is one of the common methods to improve the stability of particles in blood circulation, which covers positive charge on the surface of polyplexes and minimizes serum protein binding [186]. In addition, zwitterionic polymers with anionic and cationic end groups also show outstanding resistance to undiscovered immunogenicity and non-specific protein adsorption, which has been considered as a potential alternative of PEG [187].\n\nAfter nanoparticles being administrated into blood circulation, the non-specific interactions between serum proteins and nanoparticles result in the formation of the protein corona which mediates the uptake of nontargeting nanoparticles in liver cells [24]. The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles determine the type of targeted hepatic cells. Non-targeted or unmodified nanomaterials are mainly absorbed by non-parenchymal cells in the liver, such as Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and hepatic stellate cells, predominantly capturing by Kupffer cells [112].\n\nKupffer cells are the resident macrophages of the liver, comprising ~ 35%",

                    "text": "Along the lines above, Ouyang et al. [108] reported that doses above 1 trillion nanoparticles in mice overwhelmed Kupffer cell uptake rates, decreased liver clearance, prolonged circulation, and increased nanoparticle tumor delivery. This enabled up to 12% tumor delivery efficiency to 93% of cells in tumors, thereby boosting the therapeutic efficacy of Doxil \u00d2 . A study that administered cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA to apoE \u00c0/\u00c0 mice demonstrated that hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs was apoE dependent. This observation suggests that LNP charge plays a role in LNP biodistribution [34]. Surface charge indeed controls organ-specific delivery [109]. A strategy called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) that adds a supplemental component (termed a SORT molecule) to the four conventional LNP lipids allowed LNPs to be systematically engineered to deliver nucleic acid therapies to the lungs, spleens, and livers of mice following i.v. administration. The SORT molecule varied from permanently positively charged ionizable lipids to negatively charged lipids. LNPs modified to include a significant mol% of permanently charged lipids sorted toward the lungs. Previous studies have shown that positively charged nanoparticles tend to accumulate in the lungs [110]. Additionally, highly positively charged particles generally aggregate in biological fluids and these agglomerates could accumulate in the narrow lung capillaries. Another explanation could be that the first highly vascularized organ that nanoparticles encounter after an i.v. tail vein injection is the lungs, in which blood flow is slower due to capillary circulation [110]. Thus, the nonspecific interactions between the negatively charged sulfated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans displayed by the plasma membranes of capillary endothelial cells and the positively charged nanoparticles could trap the nanoparticles in the lungs [110]. Adding permanently negatively charged SORT molecules to LNPs directed them to the spleen, while the conventional (with close to neutral surface charge) LNPs homed to the liver. It may be that changes in the apparent pK a values endow distinct protein corona",

Kulkarni, D. Witzigmann, Marianne Lind, K. Petersson, J. Simonsen\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Liver targeting\nThe most successful liver-targeting LNPs is likely Onpattro \u00d2 , which was designed to exploit apoE binding to LNP in circulation to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes via the LDLR receptor. Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.\n\n## LNP targeting beyond the liver\nAlong the lines above, Ouyang et al. [108] reported that doses above 1 trillion nanoparticles in mice overwhelmed Kupffer cell uptake rates, decreased liver clearance, prolonged circulation, and increased nanoparticle tumor delivery. This enabled up to 12% tumor delivery efficiency to 93% of cells in tumors, thereby boosting the therapeutic efficacy of Doxil \u00d2 . A study that administered cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA to apoE \u00c0/\u00c0 mice demonstrated that hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs was apoE dependent. This observation suggests that LNP charge plays a role in LNP biodistribution [34]. Surface charge indeed controls organ-specific delivery [109]. A strategy called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) that adds a supplemental component (termed a SORT molecule) to the four conventional LNP lipids allowed LNPs to be systematically engineered to deliver nucleic acid therapies to the lungs, spleens, and livers of mice following i.v. administration. The SORT molecule varied from permanently positively charged ionizable lipids to negatively charged lipids. LNPs modified to include a significant mol% of permanently charged lipids sorted toward the lungs. Previous studies have shown that positively charged nanoparticles tend to accumulate in the lungs [110]. Additionally, highly positively charged particles generally aggregate in biological fluids and these agglomerates could accumulate in the narrow lung capillaries. Another explanation could be that the first highly vascularized organ that nanoparticles encounter after an i.v. tail vein injection is the lungs, in which blood flow is slower due to capillary circulation [110]. Thus, the nonspecific interactions between the negatively charged sulfated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans displayed by the plasma membranes of capillary endothelial cells and the positively charged nanoparticles could trap the nanoparticles in the lungs [110]. Adding permanently negatively charged SORT molecules to LNPs directed them to the spleen, while the conventional (with close to neutral surface charge) LNPs homed to the liver. It may be that changes in the apparent pK a values endow distinct protein corona",

They are mainly responsible for removing particles and pathogens from the blood through phagocytosis [58]. To enhance the uptake of LNPs by Kupffer cells and their immunoregulation ability, research has explored various strategies, including increasing the size of LNPs and modifying the LNP surface with hydrophobic molecules [59]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are located in the sinusoidal space of the liver, where they play important roles in blood filtration, metabolic regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. LSECs have a unique structure and function, enabling them to play a crucial role in immune and metabolic processes in the liver [60]. Targeting LNPs to Kupffer cells and LSECs can lead to more effective drug or gene delivery, especially in the treatment of liver diseases. For example, in diseases that require liver-specific treatment, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, this targeted delivery strategy can improve the therapeutic outcomes and reduce unnecessary side-effects. Paunovska et al. [61] explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications. This improved targeting has significant implications for the treatment of liver diseases and the application of immunotherapy.",

Alternatively, LNPs can also be decorated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligands, which bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocytes, directing the nanoparticles through receptor-mediated endocytosis [37]. This dual approach maximizes therapeutic efficacy and minimizes off-target effects, offering a robust framework for liver-specific delivery of advanced LNP-based therapies. Nevertheless, commercial LNP formulations have primarily been used for intramuscular (IM) administration, such as in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, targeting the liver. This narrow focus constrains their potential applications beyond livertargeted treatments. Targeting organs beyond the liver is critical due to the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy for different diseases and reduce hepatic toxicity. LNPs can also concentrate therapeutic agents in targeted tissues by enabling organ-specific drug delivery. Siegwart et al. developed the Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) system, directing LNPs to the lung, spleen, and liver after intravenous (IV) administration [29] (Figure 2a). By introducing SORT molecules based on the four existing lipids mentioned above, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles are modulated. SORT molecules include cationic lipids for lung targeting, anionic lipids for spleen targeting, and ionizable amino lipids for liver targeting. These lipids interact with the traditional components, altering the nanoparticles' surface charge, hydrophobicity, and interaction with biological membranes. As a result, LNPs can engage with specific cellular receptors, promoting selective uptake by target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis or enhanced membrane fusion. In recent advancements, they presented a gene editing approach based on the SORT system, achieving significant and long-lasting genome editing in lung stem cells after IV administrations [30].",

Here we introduce the concept of priming the body to receive the treatment by uncorrelating these functions into two distinct objects sequentially administered: a nanoprimer occupying transiently the main pathway responsible for therapeutic agent limited benefit/risk ratio followed by the therapeutic agent. The concept was evaluated for different nature of therapeutic agents: For nanomedicines we designed a liposomal nanoprimer presenting preferential hepatic accumulation without sign of acute toxicity. This nanoprimer was able to increase the blood bioavailability of nanomedicine correlated with a lower hepatic accumulation. Finally this nanoprimer markedly enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of irinotecan loaded liposomes in the HT-29 tumor model when compared to the nanomedicine alone. Then, for small molecules we demonstrated the ability of a cytochrome inhibitor loaded nanoprimer to increase efficacy of docetaxel treatment. These results shown that specific nanoprimers could be designed for each family of therapeutic agents to answer to their specific needs.",

The nanoprimer aims at priming the body to limit the capture of the nanomedicine product by the Kupffer cells. The expected outcomes are twofold: enhanced useful dose: the diminution of the nanomedicine product clearance by the MPS will enhance its blood bioavailability with an expected increase in treatment efficacy; decreased useless dose: correspondingly for a similar efficacy, the treatment toxicity could be reduced (and therefore adverse events more easily managed). Bioavailability raise using RES blockade has already been described by different approaches such as macrophage depletion with chlodronate loaded liposomes 26 or pre-dosing of the liver with empty DDS 27 . An article from Liu et al. 28 presents a correlation between liver saturation and increased treatment benefit/risk ratio using commercial empty liposomes presenting a broad size distribution (e. g. between 0,3 and 3 \u00b5m; phosphatidyl choline/cholesterol composition leading to low negative charge surface). These results are promising but it has been shown that biodistribution could be orientated by tuning physico-chemical attributes of the nanoparticles: as example size below 200 nm would increase hepatic accumulation compared to nanoparticles larger than 200 nm showing splenic accumulation, and highly negative surface charge would enhance macrophages internalization compared to neutral nanoparticles 29,30 . Our approach is focused on hepatic saturation since liver contains 80% of endogenous macrophages. This implies that the design of nanoprimer physico-chemical attributes must take into account the specificity of hepatic structures to maximize nanoprimer hepatic accumulation and interaction with Kupffer cells. Required physico-chemical attributes are listed in Table 1. Typically the size should be in the range 100-200 nm in order to avoid diffusion through Disse's space of sinusoidal capillaries 31 and limit splenic accumulation.",

Germain, Marie-Edith Meyre, L. Poul, Marion S. Paolini, C\u00e9line Berjaud, Francis Mpambani, Maxime Berg\u00e8re, L. L\u00e9vy, A. Pottier\n## Abstract\nMany therapeutic agents offer a low useful dose (dose responsible for efficacy)/useless dose (dose eliminated or responsible for toxicity) ratio, mainly due to the fact that therapeutic agents must ensure in one single object all the functions required to deliver the treatment, which leads to compromises in their physico-chemical design. Here we introduce the concept of priming the body to receive the treatment by uncorrelating these functions into two distinct objects sequentially administered: a nanoprimer occupying transiently the main pathway responsible for therapeutic agent limited benefit/risk ratio followed by the therapeutic agent. The concept was evaluated for different nature of therapeutic agents: For nanomedicines we designed a liposomal nanoprimer presenting preferential hepatic accumulation without sign of acute toxicity. This nanoprimer was able to increase the blood bioavailability of nanomedicine correlated with a lower hepatic accumulation. Finally this nanoprimer markedly enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of irinotecan loaded liposomes in the HT-29 tumor model when compared to the nanomedicine alone. Then, for small molecules we demonstrated the ability of a cytochrome inhibitor loaded nanoprimer to increase efficacy of docetaxel treatment. These results shown that specific nanoprimers could be designed for each family of therapeutic agents to answer to their specific needs.\n## \"Keep liver busy\" to increase useful dose/useless dose ratio\nWe propose to \"keep the liver busy\" by sequentially administering (i) a nanoprimer designed to physically and transiently saturate the Kupffer cells and (ii) a nanomedicine product (Fig. 2). The nanoprimer aims at priming the body to limit the capture of the nanomedicine product by the Kupffer cells. The expected outcomes are twofold: enhanced useful dose: the diminution of the nanomedicine product clearance by the MPS will enhance its blood bioavailability with an expected increase in treatment efficacy; decreased useless dose: correspondingly for a similar efficacy, the treatment toxicity could be reduced (and therefore adverse events more easily managed). Bioavailability raise using RES blockade has already been described by different approaches such as macrophage depletion with chlodronate loaded liposomes 26 or pre-dosing of the liver with empty DDS 27 . An article from Liu et al. 28 presents a correlation between liver saturation and increased treatment benefit/risk ratio using commercial empty liposomes presenting a broad size distribution (e. g. between 0,3 and 3 \u00b5m; phosphatidyl choline/cholesterol composition leading to low negative charge surface). These results are promising but it has been shown that biodistribution could be orientated by tuning physico-chemical attributes of the nanoparticles: as example size below 200 nm would increase hepatic accumulation compared to nanoparticles larger than 200 nm showing splenic accumulation, and highly negative surface charge would enhance macrophages internalization compared to neutral nanoparticles 29,30 . Our approach is focused on hepatic saturation since liver contains 80% of endogenous macrophages. This implies that the design of nanoprimer physico-chemical attributes must take into account the specificity of hepatic structures to maximize nanoprimer hepatic accumulation and interaction with Kupffer cells. Required physico-chemical attributes are listed in Table 1. Typically the size should be in the range 100-200 nm in order to avoid diffusion through Disse's space of sinusoidal capillaries 31 and limit splenic accumulation.",

The uptake and retention rate are highly associated with the nanoparticle's surface charge, size, and ligand chemistry. In vitro study shows that nanoparticles with strong anionic or cationic surface charges will interact with serum protein, forming a protein corona and aggregates, causing an increased interaction with macrophages [35,36]. PEGylated nanoparticles are less efficiently taken by phagocytes. Sinusoidal endothelial cells found lining the vasculature of the liver sinusoid are also involved in innate immunity. It is involved in the elimination of waste macromolecules, including components of connective tissue and hyaluronan from blood circulation by receptor-ligand interactions. Both Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells likely compete for the nanoparticles present in the circulation. In addition, the nanoparticles' physicochemical properties, such as the hydrodynamic size, influence the mechanism of cellular internalization. Nanoparticles with a diameter greater than 100 nm or aggregated nanoparticles lower than 100 nm will have greater interaction with Kupffer cells. In contrast, sinusoidal endothelial cells might take up smaller monodisperse nanoparticles to a higher degree [36]. Several key studies discussed above found that the liver preferentially took up the folate-targeting nanoparticles more than its non-targeting counterpart. Perhaps this phenomenon might be due to the FR-\u03b2 expressed by activated macrophages present in the liver.

In particular, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells take up a large proportion of nanoparticles after systemic administration, decreasing their circulation time. To reduce nanovehicle capture, Saunders et al. 115 designed a liposome with a highly negative surface charge (\u00c099.4 mV) and large size (259 nm). After intravenous injection, liposomes with these unique physicochemical properties transiently occupied the MPS and thus decreased the uptake of siRNA-loaded LNPs by Kupffer cells and LSECs, prolonging their retention in blood. Ultimately, through the action of a nanoprimer, LNPs carrying human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA increased hEPO production (by 32%) or enhanced FVII silencing (by 49%).",

In particular, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells take up a large proportion of nanoparticles after systemic administration, decreasing their circulation time. To reduce nanovehicle capture, Saunders et al. 115 designed a liposome with a highly negative surface charge (\u00c099.4 mV) and large size (259 nm). After intravenous injection, liposomes with these unique physicochemical properties transiently occupied the MPS and thus decreased the uptake of siRNA-loaded LNPs by Kupffer cells and LSECs, prolonging their retention in blood. Ultimately, through the action of a nanoprimer, LNPs carrying human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA increased hEPO production (by 32%) or enhanced FVII silencing (by 49%).",

Methods We report herein on optimizing the targeting efficiency of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) by manipulating the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value of its membrane, which reflects its ionization status. Instead of changing the chemical structure of the lipids to achieve this, we used a mixture of two types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids that show different pKa values in a single LNP. We mixed various ratios of YSK05 and YSK12-C4 lipids, which have pKa values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively, in one formulation (referred to as YSK05/12-LNP). Results The pKa of the YSK05/12-LNP was dependent not only on the molar ratio of each lipid but also on the individual contribution of each lipid to the final pKa (the YSK12-C4 lipid showed a higher contribution). Furthermore, we succeeded in targeting and delivering short interfering RNA to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells using one of the YSK05/12-LNPs which showed an optimum pKa value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) to permit the particles to be taken up by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Conclusion This strategy has the potential for preparing custom LNPs with endless varieties of structures and final pKa values, and would have poten tial applications in drug delivery and ionic-based tissue targeting.",

LSECs, which are the physical barrier that separate liver tissues from the blood flow, 16,17 have significant roles under normal conditions, including providing a selective and permeable barrier, facilitating the transport of metabolites and waste clearance, [18][19][20] regulating hepatic blood flow, maintaining a low portal pressure, 21 and keeping hepatic stellate cells in their inactivated state to prevent fibrosis. 22 ][29][30][31] Therefore, LSECs are possible drug targets for preventing or treating related liver disorders, especially those associated with genetic disturbances. Based on our previous observations, LSECs take up LNPs with higher pKa values, in the pKa range tested (5.70-7.25). 32 However, higher pKa values were not examined and the optimum pKa value for targeting LSECs is not currently known. \n\nWe previously developed an LNP composed of different types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids, namely YSK lipids (referred to as YSK-LNP), to deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo, particularly in hepatocytes. 33,34 In our previous study, slightly cationic LNP formulations that were composed of lipids with high pKa values, such as YSK13-C4 (pKa 6.80) and YSK15-C4 (pKa 7.10), were found to be highly localized in LSECs as opposed to hepatocytes. 32 Nevertheless, they showed a weak gene silencing activity in LSECs, possibly due to their inactivation by endothelial lipase (EL). 32 his prompted us to investigate the feasibility of targeting LSECs using lipase-resistant LNPs in which the membrane had optimized pKa values.",

Harashima\n## Abstract\nIntroduction The development of targeted drug delivery systems is a rapidly growing area in the field of nanomedicine. Methods We report herein on optimizing the targeting efficiency of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) by manipulating the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value of its membrane, which reflects its ionization status. Instead of changing the chemical structure of the lipids to achieve this, we used a mixture of two types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids that show different pKa values in a single LNP. We mixed various ratios of YSK05 and YSK12-C4 lipids, which have pKa values of 6.50 and 8.00, respectively, in one formulation (referred to as YSK05/12-LNP). Results The pKa of the YSK05/12-LNP was dependent not only on the molar ratio of each lipid but also on the individual contribution of each lipid to the final pKa (the YSK12-C4 lipid showed a higher contribution). Furthermore, we succeeded in targeting and delivering short interfering RNA to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells using one of the YSK05/12-LNPs which showed an optimum pKa value of 7.15 and an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) to permit the particles to be taken up by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Conclusion This strategy has the potential for preparing custom LNPs with endless varieties of structures and final pKa values, and would have poten tial applications in drug delivery and ionic-based tissue targeting.\n## Introduction\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are an example of a tissue that would be a suitable model for our study and could be targeted based on the ionic charge of their surface. LSECs, which are the physical barrier that separate liver tissues from the blood flow, 16,17 have significant roles under normal conditions, including providing a selective and permeable barrier, facilitating the transport of metabolites and waste clearance, [18][19][20] regulating hepatic blood flow, maintaining a low portal pressure, 21 and keeping hepatic stellate cells in their inactivated state to prevent fibrosis. 22 ][29][30][31] Therefore, LSECs are possible drug targets for preventing or treating related liver disorders, especially those associated with genetic disturbances. Based on our previous observations, LSECs take up LNPs with higher pKa values, in the pKa range tested (5.70-7.25). 32 However, higher pKa values were not examined and the optimum pKa value for targeting LSECs is not currently known. \n\nWe previously developed an LNP composed of different types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids, namely YSK lipids (referred to as YSK-LNP), to deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo, particularly in hepatocytes. 33,34 In our previous study, slightly cationic LNP formulations that were composed of lipids with high pKa values, such as YSK13-C4 (pKa 6.80) and YSK15-C4 (pKa 7.10), were found to be highly localized in LSECs as opposed to hepatocytes. 32 Nevertheless, they showed a weak gene silencing activity in LSECs, possibly due to their inactivation by endothelial lipase (EL). 32 his prompted us to investigate the feasibility of targeting LSECs using lipase-resistant LNPs in which the membrane had optimized pKa values.\n\n## Discussion\nThe YSK05/12-LNP formulation which is composed of YSK05/YSK12-C4/cholesterol/ m PEG 2k -DMG (50:20:30:2 mol%) and a pKa value of 7.15 was chosen for use in experiments to target LSECs and compared with YSK05-LNP. Although YSK05-LNP and YSK05/12-LNP have a similar biodistribution, as shown in Figure S2, in which the lipids and siRNA of both types of LNPs were visualized by Fluo-rVivo imaging and were found to be largely distributed to liver tissues, the intrahepatic distribution of those LNPs varied and was determined by their pKa value. The intrahepatic distribution was shifted substantially from hepatocytes (with YSK05-LNP [pKa 6.50; Figure 6, upper]) into LSECs (with YSK05/12-LNP [pKa 7.15; Figure 6, lower]). However, we observed that traces of the YSK05/12-LNP were distributed into hepatocytes and liver resident macrophages (Kupffer cells). Furthermore, the biodistribution of YSK05/12-LNP to the lung and spleen was minimal (only a weak siRNA fluorescent intensity was detected in lungs [Figure S2]) and its silencing activity in lung and spleen endothelia was weak (Figure S1). The selectivity of the YSK05/12-LNP for the liver endothelium over the lung or spleen endothelium can be attributed to the special scavenging character of LSECs, which have a very high endocytic capacity and are responsible for the uptake of soluble or colloidal materials and nanoparticles that are not large enough to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. 16,17,20,46,47",

            "abstract": "Recently, biomimetic nanoparticles, especially cell membrane-cloaked nanoparticles, have attracted increasing attention in biomedical applications, including antitumor therapy, detoxification, and immune modulation, by imitating the structure and the function of biological systems such as long circulation life in the blood. However, the circulation time of cell membrane-cloaked nanoparticles is far less than that of the original cells, greatly limiting their biomedical applications, while the underlying reasons are seldom demonstrated. In this study, the influence of particle size on the circulation and the biodistribution of red blood cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (RBC-NPs) as model biomimetic nanoparticles were investigated. Differently sized RBC-NPs (80, 120, 160, and 200 nm) were prepared by fusing RBC membranes on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles. It was shown that the particle size did not change the cellular uptake of these biomimetic nanoparticles by macrophage cells in vitro and their immunogenic responses in vivo. However, their circulation life in vivo decreased with the particle size, while their accumulation in the liver increased with the particle size, which might be related to their size-dependent filtration through hepatic sinusoids. These findings will provide experimental evidence for the design and the optimization of biomimetic nanoparticles.",

Pang\n## Abstract\nRecently, biomimetic nanoparticles, especially cell membrane-cloaked nanoparticles, have attracted increasing attention in biomedical applications, including antitumor therapy, detoxification, and immune modulation, by imitating the structure and the function of biological systems such as long circulation life in the blood. However, the circulation time of cell membrane-cloaked nanoparticles is far less than that of the original cells, greatly limiting their biomedical applications, while the underlying reasons are seldom demonstrated. In this study, the influence of particle size on the circulation and the biodistribution of red blood cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (RBC-NPs) as model biomimetic nanoparticles were investigated. Differently sized RBC-NPs (80, 120, 160, and 200 nm) were prepared by fusing RBC membranes on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles. It was shown that the particle size did not change the cellular uptake of these biomimetic nanoparticles by macrophage cells in vitro and their immunogenic responses in vivo. However, their circulation life in vivo decreased with the particle size, while their accumulation in the liver increased with the particle size, which might be related to their size-dependent filtration through hepatic sinusoids. These findings will provide experimental evidence for the design and the optimization of biomimetic nanoparticles.\n## Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution\nRecently, it has been found that the liver flow dynamics and cellular phenotype contribute greatly to the accumulation of conventional nanomaterials with different surface chemistries [50].As nanomaterials enter the liver, their velocity is sharply reduced (1000-fold), leading to more nanomaterial interaction with hepatic cells relative to peripheral cells.Kupffer cells (similar to macrophages), hepatic B cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells mainly contribute to the uptake of nanomaterials in the liver [50].Intriguingly, in this study, sinusoidal endothelial cells showed low uptake of RBC-NPs as little overlay of RBC-NPs with sinusoidal endothelial cells was found in all groups (Figure 6A), indicating the distribution pattern of RBC-NPs in the liver was different from that of conventional nanoparticles.Considering that the particle size did not influence the cellular uptake of RBC-NPs by macrophages, the size-dependent circulation and distribution in the liver might be mainly due to the liver filtration of RBC-NPs.\n\nIt has been shown that the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, such as shape [35], size [52,53], surface chemistry [54], elasticity [55], topographical structure [56], and crystallization [57], determine their absorption of serum proteins, cellular uptake by macrophages, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution in vivo.For instance, the serum protein adsorption and phagocytic uptake are markedly decreased for the nanoparticles with higher PEG length or smaller size [52].The conjugation of a second PEG layer at a density close to but lower than the mushroom-to-brush transition regime on conventional PEGylated nanoparticles dramatically prolongs their blood circulation via reduced nanoparticle uptake by non-Kupffer cells in the liver, especially liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [56].",

Despite its utility, the instability of mRNA requires suitable carriers for in vivo delivery. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are employed to protect mRNA from degradation and enhance its intracellular delivery. To further optimize the therapeutic efficacy of mRNA, site-specific LNPs have been developed. Through local or systemic administration, these site-specific LNPs can accumulate in specific organs, tissues, or cells, allowing for the intracellular delivery of mRNA to specific cells and enabling the exertion of local or systemic therapeutic effects. This not only improves the efficiency of mRNA therapy but also reduces off-target adverse effects. In this review, we summarize recent site-specific mRNA delivery strategies, including different organ- or tissue-specific LNP after local injection, and organ-specific or cell-specific LNP after intravenous injection. We also provide an outlook on the prospects of mRNA therapy.",

It is reported that increasing the size of LNPs and surface modification of LNP with hydrophobic molecules could enhance the cellular uptake and promote immune regulation of Kupffer cells. 84 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) reside in the liver sinusoids and are responsible for blood filtration, metabolism regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. 85 To realize the Kupffer cell or LSECs specific mRNA delivery, Dahlem group applied many different kinds of cholesterol in the prescription of LNP, and found the structure of cholesterol has a great influence on the targeting ability of LNP. 86 They screened LNP formulated with different oxidized cholesterol with fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) system, and conclude that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol will deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells, which is different from the traditional LNP that mainly target to hepatocyte. Considering the important role of Kupffer cells and LSECs in antigen presentation and anti-inflammation effects, this LNP could be further used for immunotherapy. Pattipeiluhu et al. prepared a scavenger receptor LNPs (srLNPs) that could specifically target sinusoidal endothelial cells. 87 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) are the primary cell types of the hepatic blood vessel and sinusoids, which are responsible for liver homeostasis. Moreover, LSECs can function as antigen-presenting cells for regulating adaptive immunity and immunotolerance, considered a good target for immunotherapy. Based on the previous studies, anionic nanoparticles can be taken up by SECs, which are mediated by the stabilin receptors. Here, they prepared the srLNPs by referring to the composition of Onpattro. The only difference is the zwitterionic lipid DSPC was replaced by anionic lipid DSPG.",

Xia\n## Abstract\nThe success of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated the development of mRNA therapy. mRNA is a negatively charged nucleic acid that serves as a template for protein synthesis in the ribosome. Despite its utility, the instability of mRNA requires suitable carriers for in vivo delivery. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are employed to protect mRNA from degradation and enhance its intracellular delivery. To further optimize the therapeutic efficacy of mRNA, site-specific LNPs have been developed. Through local or systemic administration, these site-specific LNPs can accumulate in specific organs, tissues, or cells, allowing for the intracellular delivery of mRNA to specific cells and enabling the exertion of local or systemic therapeutic effects. This not only improves the efficiency of mRNA therapy but also reduces off-target adverse effects. In this review, we summarize recent site-specific mRNA delivery strategies, including different organ- or tissue-specific LNP after local injection, and organ-specific or cell-specific LNP after intravenous injection. We also provide an outlook on the prospects of mRNA therapy.\n## Kupffer Cells and Liver Endothelial Cells Targeted LNP\nKupffer cells play an important role in liver inflammation and immune tolerance, and they clear particles mainly through phagocytosis. It is reported that increasing the size of LNPs and surface modification of LNP with hydrophobic molecules could enhance the cellular uptake and promote immune regulation of Kupffer cells. 84 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) reside in the liver sinusoids and are responsible for blood filtration, metabolism regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. 85 To realize the Kupffer cell or LSECs specific mRNA delivery, Dahlem group applied many different kinds of cholesterol in the prescription of LNP, and found the structure of cholesterol has a great influence on the targeting ability of LNP. 86 They screened LNP formulated with different oxidized cholesterol with fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) system, and conclude that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol will deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells, which is different from the traditional LNP that mainly target to hepatocyte. Considering the important role of Kupffer cells and LSECs in antigen presentation and anti-inflammation effects, this LNP could be further used for immunotherapy. Pattipeiluhu et al. prepared a scavenger receptor LNPs (srLNPs) that could specifically target sinusoidal endothelial cells. 87 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) are the primary cell types of the hepatic blood vessel and sinusoids, which are responsible for liver homeostasis. Moreover, LSECs can function as antigen-presenting cells for regulating adaptive immunity and immunotolerance, considered a good target for immunotherapy. Based on the previous studies, anionic nanoparticles can be taken up by SECs, which are mediated by the stabilin receptors. Here, they prepared the srLNPs by referring to the composition of Onpattro. The only difference is the zwitterionic lipid DSPC was replaced by anionic lipid DSPG.",

Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophage population, are known to phagocytose foreign particulates. Most of the nanoparticles are typically taken up by Kupffer cells in the liver, which preferentially interact with negatively charged NPs. Kupffer cells are responsible for immune and inflammatory responses and regulate liver diseases, including NAFLD. Hepatocytes, which are specialized epithelial cells, also interact with NPs but to a lower extent than the macrophages. ey activate other liver cells and are also involved in immune and inflammatory responses. In contrary to Kupffer cells, hepatocyte uptake of NPs increases with positive zeta potential. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are specialized endothelial cells that form the interface between blood cells and liver cells. Open fenestrations and lack of basal lamina of LSECs provide a mesh-like structure leading to the entrapment of NPs in the liver. Stellate cells are fat-storing cells that play a crucial role in liver fibrosis [17,19]. is preferential distribution to the liver is attributed to the presence of fenestrations along the endothelial barrier of the liver and the absence of basal lamina. After systemic administration, the majority of NPs with a size above 6 nm accumulate in the liver. \n\nus, enterohepatic circulation plays a vital role to deliver orally administered NPs to the liver [20]. \n\nNonparenchymal cells located at the sinusoidal endothelium (i.e., Kupffer cells) are responsible for passive targeting due to their location in the liver sinusoid. Nanoparticles with the size of >100 nm mostly accumulate in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, while the smaller nanoparticles (<100 nm) passively target hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells [21]. e optimum size of NPs for liver delivery is about 40-150 nm [22]. \n\n1.5.

To reduce nanovehicle capture, Saunders et al. 115 designed a liposome with a highly negative surface charge (\u00c099.4 mV) and large size (259 nm). After intravenous injection, liposomes with these unique physicochemical properties transiently occupied the MPS and thus decreased the uptake of siRNA-loaded LNPs by Kupffer cells and LSECs, prolonging their retention in blood. Ultimately, through the action of a nanoprimer, LNPs carrying human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA increased hEPO production (by 32%) or enhanced FVII silencing (by 49%).",

Positively charged particles prefer to be internalized by hepatocyte [182,183], while Kupffer cells present a greater tendency to ingest nanoparticles with negative charges [4]. The proper cationic charge density of particles is necessary for greater membrane affinity and nucleic acid binding affinity [184,185]. However, in the blood circulation, serum proteins with negative charges are possibly adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, antibodies or complement proteins may also deposit on the surface, leading to poor serum stability [170]. The aggregates with the size over 200 nm and a larger negative surface charge will be eliminated by resident macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow [170,184,185]. Therefore, it is important to achieve a balance between cell internalization and serum stability. PEG decoration on the nanoparticle surface is one of the common methods to improve the stability of particles in blood circulation, which covers positive charge on the surface of polyplexes and minimizes serum protein binding [186]. In addition, zwitterionic polymers with anionic and cationic end groups also show outstanding resistance to undiscovered immunogenicity and non-specific protein adsorption, which has been considered as a potential alternative of PEG [187].\n\nAfter nanoparticles being administrated into blood circulation, the non-specific interactions between serum proteins and nanoparticles result in the formation of the protein corona which mediates the uptake of nontargeting nanoparticles in liver cells [24]. The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles determine the type of targeted hepatic cells. Non-targeted or unmodified nanomaterials are mainly absorbed by non-parenchymal cells in the liver, such as Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and hepatic stellate cells, predominantly capturing by Kupffer cells [112].\n\nKupffer cells are the resident macrophages of the liver, comprising ~ 35%",

Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "The liver constitutes one of the largest organs of the body and exerts numerous essential functions associated with digestion, metabolism, protein synthesis and the detoxification of xenobiotics [1]. Hence, the liver is a primary site of various metabolic disorders [2]. Further, chronic hepatitis [3] and metabolic disorders [4] may result in liver fibrosis or even cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is considered a premalignant state as 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most frequent type of primary liver cancer, develop in cirrhotic livers [5]. In addition, due to anatomical reasons, the liver is also a primary organ of tumor metastasis [6]. The therapy of liver tumors is complicated by the default tolerogenic state of liver-resident non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) [7]. Hence, the liver, with its different specialized cell types, is a highly interesting target organ for cell-type-addressing nanoformulations, thereby avoiding adverse side effects, such as systemic toxicity [8]. However, as outlined in this review, the structure of the liver has proven a challenge for nano-based cell-targeting approaches. \n\nOn the one hand, the liver acts as a biological barrier and may sequestrate the vast majority of administered nanoparticles (NPs) from the bloodstream, when particles (>6 nm) are not eliminated by the kidney [9]. However, on the other hand, within the liver NPs need to pass several biological barriers hindering their successful uptake by the different liver cell populations [10]. In this regard, NPs intended to address hepatocytes need to cross the sinusoidal fenestrations of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) [11,12]. Furthermore, Kupffer cells (KCs), that constitute the major liver-resident macrophage population [13], and LSECs express various types of Fc and scavenger receptors [14] for the efficient uptake of larger KC [13] and smaller LSEC [15] macromolecules, and consequently also NPs [9].",

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes.

            "text": "Kupffer cells, as macrophages in the liver, play a key role in immune monitoring and the inflammatory response of the liver. They are mainly responsible for removing particles and pathogens from the blood through phagocytosis [58]. To enhance the uptake of LNPs by Kupffer cells and their immunoregulation ability, research has explored various strategies, including increasing the size of LNPs and modifying the LNP surface with hydrophobic molecules [59]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are located in the sinusoidal space of the liver, where they play important roles in blood filtration, metabolic regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. LSECs have a unique structure and function, enabling them to play a crucial role in immune and metabolic processes in the liver [60]. Targeting LNPs to Kupffer cells and LSECs can lead to more effective drug or gene delivery, especially in the treatment of liver diseases. For example, in diseases that require liver-specific treatment, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, this targeted delivery strategy can improve the therapeutic outcomes and reduce unnecessary side-effects. Paunovska et al. [61] explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications. This improved targeting has significant implications for the treatment of liver diseases and the application of immunotherapy.",

            "text": "The specific properties of nanoparticles such as size, hydrophilicity, and surface charge are the most fundamental factors that determine whether they have superior cell or tissue targeting capacity. Appropriate adjustments of the physicochemical features enable nanomedicines to enter liver cells in a passive-targeted manner, thereby increasing the accumulation of liver and reducing renal clearance and undesired distribution in other organs [24]. Particle size notably affects cell and tissue uptake. Liu et al. observed that nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm were rapidly cleared via renal filtration, resulting in low plaque accumulation [173]. In the liver, since the diameter of fenestrae in normal liver sinusoid endothelial cells is about 50-200 nm [174,175], nanoscaled particles with diameters < 200 nm can pass through sinusoids [170]. This is beneficial for nanoparticles to evade capture by Kupffer cells and reach hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells [24,176]. Nanoparticles with diameters > 400 nm can diffuse through the sinusoid endothelial fenestrations by forced extrusion, presumably owing to transient interaction with the sinusoidal endothelial cells [177]. As a result, particles with larger size are more likely to be phagocytized by Kupffer cells [178], especially 200-1000 nm [179], even microbubbles of ultrasound imaging with the diameters of 1-10 \u00b5m [180].\n\nNanoparticles with hydrophobic surface are readily identified by mononuclear phagocyte system and primarily captured by spleen and liver [181]. Moreover, they are quickly removed from the systemic circulation [182]. By contrast, nanoscaled particles with hydrophilic surface are hardly taken up by the mononuclear phagocyte system. The nanoparticles with hydrophilic properties can enhance their permeation and retention effects, thereby increasing the accumulation in liver [87].\n\nThe surface charge is also a factor that affects the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. Positively charged particles prefer to be internalized by hepatocyte [182,183], while Kupffer cells present a greater tendency to ingest nanoparticles",

Figure 2 shows a schematic overview of LNP uptake in the liver, demon-strating the journey of LNPs through the sinusoidal lumen, across LSECs and the Disse space, to hepatocytes, where receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs. The interactions of LNPs with other liver cell subtypes, such as CD74-expressing macrophages and CD32-expressing endothelial cells, affect how efficiently nucleic acids are delivered. 32 Table 1 summarizes these cell types and their interactions with LNPs. \n\nKupffer cells are distinct macrophages that reside in the liver sinusoids, are responsible for a large fraction of the body's total macrophages, and are involved in clearing circulating nanoparticles and other foreign materials from the blood. Kupffer cells rapidly take up LNPs, resulting in their predominant distribution in the liver after intravenous administration. 23,33 Alongside their phagocytic function, Kupffer cells have defined subpopulations with inflammatory (CD74High) and tolerogenic (CD74Low) phenotypes, 32 which can influence the immune response and nanoparticle clearance. Their high uptake often limits the amount of LNPs reaching hepatocytes, as Kupffer cells sequester the nanoparticles before they can reach their target cells, reducing functional delivery. 35  et al. 11 demonstrated that modulating Kupffer cell activity can enhance nanoparticle delivery to target tissues. Depletion of Kupffer cells has been shown to improve the functional delivery of nanoparticles to hepatocytes and improve therapeutic outcomes, especially in cancer models. 36 y strategies include: \n\n(1) Saturation of Kupffer cells using non-toxic materials to temporarily reduce their phagocytic capacity. \n\nDepletion of Kupffer cells to minimize liver sequestration and enhance nanoparticle circulation to target tissues.",

            "text": "2][3][4] LNP technology has come a long way, starting with early liposomal drug systems and advancing to sophisticated formulations designed for precise nucleic acid delivery. [7][8][9] One key feature of LNPs is their preferential accumulation in the liver, a phenomenon that has been well exploited for treating liver disease. This liver-specific tropism depends on interactions with serum proteins (e.g., apolipoprotein E [ApoE]) as well as the liver's anatomy and physiology. 10,11 Upon systemic administration, LNPs rapidly bind to ApoE, which facilitates their targeting to hepatocytes via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 12 As an additional driver of LNP accumulation, the liver's participation in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) is fundamental to ApoE-mediated targeting. 10 Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophages that filter nanoparticles from the bloodstream, contribute to liver tropism but can also reduce ther-apeutic efficacy by trapping LNPs before they reach hepatocytes. 13 To address this limitation, lipid compositions are optimized to evade macrophage uptake or to maximize delivery to hepatocytes. 14 e role of the RES in LNP biodistribution is exemplified by Wang et al., 15 who demonstrated how hard nanomaterials are sequestered in the liver through interactions with its microarchitecture and specific cellular components. They have shown that liver-resident Kupffer cells, B cells, and endothelial cells are responsible for nanomaterial accumulation, with Kupffer cells having the highest uptake. At the same time, nanomaterials enter the liver sinusoids at a slower flow rate than in systemic circulation, which increases their probability of uptake by these phagocytic cells, such as Kupffer cells. \n\nOnce inside hepatocytes, LNPs enable applications such as gene editing, gene expression, and gene silencing 16 (Figure 1), as previously reported. 17",

LNPs accumulated broadly across these cell types, though functional mRNA delivery was notably higher in liver endothelial cells than in Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. Liver endothelial cells, with their distinctive discontinuous vasculature, act as a gateway, allowing LNPs to extravasate into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes and other liver cells. Notably, endothelial cell subtypes, for example, CD32High (central venous zone) and CD32Low (periportal zone), showed different interactions with LNPs, with CD32Low cells exhibiting higher accumulation. This spatial distribution and receptor expression in liver endothelial cells influenced LNP uptake and processing, which in turn impacted biodistribution and functional delivery (Figure 3). 0][51] As part of the fibrotic matrix in liver disease, they may also influence how LNPs interact with the immune system. 34",

            "text": "With a blood flow of about 2 l/min and a sinusoidal blood lining surface area the size of a tennis court, the liver is one of the most vascularized tissues in the body. It is responsible for the clearance of large molecules and nanoparticles from blood, a function which is often counterproductive to the successful delivery of therapeutic compounds to other tissues or even specific cells within the liver. Several studies show that oligonucleotides (unmodified or conjugated) will end up in the liver to a far higher extent than the intended target tissue, although the rates vary between studies. In one study intravenous administration of an AON resulted in 40% and 18% accumulation in the liver and kidneys respectively (Bijsterbosch et al, 1997), whilst intravenous administration of CpG oligonucleotides resulted in 50% and 40% accumulation in the liver and kidneys respectively (Martin-Armas et al, 2006). The main cellular site of liver uptake are the extremely active scavenger liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) (Sorensen et al, 2015) followed by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (KCs; (Bijsterbosch et al, 1997), however the degree of uptake in hepatocytes can vary from 40% in the first study to no apparent uptake in the CpG study. Similarly, a histological study revealed that phosphorothioate oligonucleotides accumulated mainly in KCs and LSECs (Butler et al, 1997). KCs specialize in phagocytic clearance of blood-borne particles larger than 200 nm while LSECs mediate the clearance of smaller particles such as oligonucleotides, peptides, large macromolecules and nanoparticles via rapid and powerful clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Sorensen et al, 2012). LSECs contain fenestrations with numerous open pores of 50-150 nm in diameter, enabling access into the underlying perisinusoidal space and therefore to hepatocytes. However, LSECs are also able to endocytose from the perisinusoidal space and do so at a",

For example, positively charged mesoporous silica NPs (MSNPs) underwent significant uptake by hepatocytes, while MSNPs with negative charges were rapidly internalized by Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids [33]. The negative charge of the nanocarriers could facilitate efficient binding to  the scavenger receptors on the surface of Kupffer cells and LSECs, leading to the improved uptake by these cell types [34,35]. \n\nAnother intrinsic property that dictates the uptake pathway of the nanocarriers by liver cells is hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity. Increased hydrophilicity via decoration with polyethylene glycol (PEG) may minimalize the uptake of nanocarriers by Kupffer cells, and such PEGylated nanocarriers are likely taken up by hepatocytes [36][37][38][39]. Besides augmenting hydrophilicity through PEGylation, stealth properties could be endowed to the nanocarriers through a serum albumin corona to escape Kupffer cells' clearance, facilitating direct uptake in hepatocytes [40]. Hydrophobic nanocarriers are rapidly cleared from the systemic circulation by Kupffer cells [33]. \n\nIn the pathophysiological condition of hepatocellular carcinoma, microvascular density and permeability are increased because of angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment [41]. The fenestrae of the liver endothelial cells increase to approximately 400-600 nm, often accompanied with impaired lymphatic drainage, leading to the EPR effect [42]. In contrast, the excessive production of ECM by the activated HSCs in liver fibrosis resulted in a loss of the fenestrae, hindering plasma to reach the perisinusoidal space [43].",

            "text": "The term \"liver gene therapy\" is often used to unilaterally describe all gene therapy approaches for treating diseases originating in hepatocytes. Although hepatocytes are the most prominent cell type within the liver, several other cell types can interact with nanoparticles and affect their performance [41][42][43][44]. It is therefore recommended that scientists expand their LNP studies to include single cell quantification rather than the whole liver. Every liver lobule comprises parenchymal (i.e. hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal liver cells (i.e. LSECs and Kupffer cells). In addition to these three major cell types, the liver consists of several other cell populations. A recent study revealed 20 discrete cell types ranging from stellate cells (also known as Ito cells) and cholangiocytes to immune cells such as B, T, or NK-like cells [45]. The human liver cell atlas revealed additional subtypes within the liver microenvironment [46]. The most relevant cell types and their implications for LNP-based gene therapy are discussed in the next sections, following the particle's journey in the body after systemic administration [47].\n\nFollowing intravenous injection, LNP-siRNA systems (composed of CLinDMA:Cholesterol:PEG-DMG; 50:44:6 mol%) accumulate in all major liver cell types (i.e. Kupffer cells, LSECs, and hepatocytes) in a time-and dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by Shi et al. [49]. When LNP-siRNA were administered at 0.3 mg siRNA/kg, similar siRNA amounts were detected in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Doses of 1 mg/kg to 9 mg/kg siRNA delivered 50% to 83%, respectively, to hepatocytes. At 30 minutes post injection, LNPs were mainly localized in the space of Disse, whereas 2 hours post injection LNPs accumulated in hepatocytes. siRNAs delivered to Kupffer cells and LSECs were inactive, but delivery to hepatocytes resulted in efficient gene silencing.

            "text": "The accumulation of any type of NPs in the liver is generally accomplished because of the central role of the liver itself as a main metabolic and excretory organ in the body. The presence of fenestrations in the layers of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the absence of the impermeable basal lamina allow for rapid accumulation of NPs in the liver through passive targeting [24]. Complementing certain anatomic or pathophysiological features of the target organ, such passive accumulation also relies on nanoparticle properties including size, shape, surface charge, and hydrophilicity [25]. For instance, the passive liver targeting strategy highly depends on the size of nanocarriers as the endothelial fenestrations of liver sinusoids span approximately 50-200 nm in diameter (Figure 2a). In their study, Hirn and co-workers revealed that 50% of small gold NPs (around 1.4 nm) were accumulated in the liver after systemic administration. As the size was increased into 200 nm, the fraction of gold NPs accumulated in the liver was further increased to 99% [26]. The fact that around 80-90% of all macrophage population resides in the liver also contributes to the passive accumulation of NPs in the liver [27,28]. \n\nThe interaction of the nanocarriers with various types of cells is size-dependent [30]. Nanocarriers with a particle size bigger than 100 nm could be taken up by LSECs and Kupffer cells through endocytosis. With the increase of particle size, the uptake of nanocarriers by Kupffer cells is enhanced, leading to rapid accumulation of the nanocarriers in the liver with short blood circulation time [31]. In contrast, nanocarriers with a particle size smaller than 100 nm could avoid a capture by Kupffer cells. These nanocarriers then diffuse out of the sinusoids through the dynamic endothelial fenestrations to reach HSCs in the perisinusoidal space or even hepatocytes [24,29]. Smaller nanocarriers (10-20 nm) can be taken up rapidly by hepatocytes [32].",

            "text": "Recent literature suggests that the biodistribution of nanoformulations can be altered significantly and their clearance by the liver strongly inhibited.An emerging PK-enhancing adjuvant therapy uses payload-free nanoparticles referred to as nanoprimers [42] that have the function of increasing the bioavailability of other nanoparticles, whose function is to carry a therapeutic payload (therapeutic nanoparticles).The PK boosting effect is achieved by administering the nanoprimer prior to the therapeutic nanoparticles, thereby causing a delay in the hepatic clearance of the therapeutic nanoparticles.A secondary benefit is liver toxicity reduction, a common risk with both engineered nanoparticles and viral vectors used to deliver nucleic acid-based therapies.\n\nPreclinical proof-of-concept studies have been conducted to show that payload-free liposomes can be used to increase exposure of nucleic acids in target tissues by temporarily reducing unwanted hepatic clearance [43][44][45].In these studies, nanoprimers were engineered to be rapidly phagocytosed by Kupffer Cells (KCs) and Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells (LSECs) after intravenous administration.LSECs are scavenger cells with a diameter of 7-9 \u00b5m capable of internalizing particles up to 0.23 \u00b5m, while KCs are resident liver macrophages with a diameter of 10-15 \u00b5m that can take up larger particles than KCs [46,47].Germain et al. [43] describe the physicochemical attributes claimed to be optimal for liver accumulation.They argue that nanoprimer particles need to be larger than the fenestration size of the space of Disse to be preferentially cleared by KCs and not by hepatocytes, and smaller than 200 nm to avoid spleen accumulation.They also claim that that the charge should be neither positive, a known source of toxicity, nor too negative, to avoid macrophage internalization.More details on different nanoparticle formulations and liver interactions were recently summarized by Zhang et al. [48].",

            "text": "The use of particles as carriers of therapeutic agents for liver targeting is not a new idea. Hepatic nanoparticle uptake and distribution was initially studied as a drawback to be avoided because it entails a lack of specific selective distribution to other desired targets as well as toxicity and safety concerns. Nevertheless, from another point of view, strategies of selective delivery to different kinds of hepatic cells have also been explored in the search for specific targets of drugs included in nanoparticulated systems, such as hepatocytes, hepatic stellar cells, endothelial cells, and also the Kupffer cells (KC), the resident liver macrophages. \n\nThe liver is a very complex organ with many cells that are different in both morphology and functionality but which are nonetheless strongly inter-related. Although there are some other hepatic cells with phagocytic activity, KCs are undoubtedly the main ones responsible for phagocytosis in the liver. Moreover, it is estimated that they constitute 80-90% of all the macrophages present in the body (1). \n\nKupffer cells are the liver-resident macrophages, considered professional phagocytes to distinguish them from facultative ones. They are the largest mononuclear phagocyte population in the body and constitute approximately 20% of non-parenchymal liver cells. They present functional heterogeneity, likely due to their different origins and intrinsic plasticity (2). \n\nThey have an evident role in monitoring the blood entering the zone in order to endocytose debris, degenerated cells and any potentially harmful materials from the gut and circulation stream. Their strategic location at the luminal side of the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium allows them to act as sentinels that capture and process particles. They are involved in antigen presentation and processing and in the modulation of some hepatocyte functions. \n\nActivation of Kupffer cells can induce a series of events to inhibit pathogen replication, recruit other immune cells into the liver, and activate them. On the other hand, interaction derived from infiltration immune cells leads to KC regulation (2).",

            "text": "For therapeutic nanomaterials, tissue-targeted delivery systems can significantly reduce toxicity and improve bioavailability. Currently, liver-targeted delivery systems are commonly used for the treatment of NAFLD and chronic HBV infection. 36 The absence of a basement membrane and the presence of fenestrations in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) provide the physiological basis for the passive accumulation of nanomaterials in the liver. Besides, the mononuclear phagocyte system, including Kupffer cells, monocytes, and splenic macrophages, helps sequester the majority of nanomaterials in the liver. 37 hagocytosis by the mononuclear phagocyte system is influenced by the route of administration and the properties of nanomaterials, such as size, shape, charge, and rigidity. Nanomaterials ranging from 50 to 250 nm in size, with nonspherical shapes, high charge density, and surface hydrophobicity, are more likely to be captured by the hepatic mononuclear phagocyte system upon entering the bloodstream, thereby facilitating hepatic accumulation. 37,38 This effect may result from opsonization, in which opsonins bind to the nanomaterials, enhancing their recognition and uptake by macrophages. 38 dditionally, albumin-based formulations target the liver by leveraging the transcytosis of albumin through LSECs, facilitating precise delivery to the space of Disse. 39 Moreover, long half-life, high stability, and capacity to bind hydrophobic molecules enhance albumin's accumulation, making it an effective drug delivery vehicle for liver diseases. 40 everal characteristics of the liver can be utilized for active liver-targeted strategies: 36 (1) The larger pore size of LSECs compared to capillary walls in most tissues: Macromolecules can enter liver tissue and accumulate. For instance, the accumulation of dextran in the liver is tissue-dependent based on molecular weight.",

Within the liver, the majority of ASO/NAP accumulation occurs in LSECs, with smaller accumulations in KC and hepatocytes (Figure 4) [53]. The PS modification is only very sparingly used in siRNA and as such, even when stabilized with a variety of 2\u2032 ribose modifications, very little accumulation occurs in the liver. First generation siRNA drugs used lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. LNP-siRNA complexes siRNA RISC loading  LNA reduces oligonucleotide hydration [36,37] and alters the structure of oligonucleotides to a rigid A-form configuration [38,39], which can interfere with oligonucleotide function [40] and drives the formation of highly stable secondary structures with various homopolymeric sequences [41][42][43]. These structural alterations direct significant off-target RNAseH mediated mRNA cleavage with LNA-modified ASOs, which results in increased hepatoxicity [44,45].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles have also been modified with targeting motifs on their surface or through the addition of cholesterol or non-cationic helper lipids in order to enable and improve selectivity for endothelial cells. Since endothelial cells express unique surface molecules such as sugars and proteins, lipid nanoparticles have been coated with molecules that target endothelial surface molecules. For example, Kusumoto et al. developed a lipid nanoparticle coated with GALA peptides on their surface to selectively target pulmonary endothelial cells [123]. The GALA peptides were capable of directing the nanoparticles to endothelial cells by targeting the sialic acid-terminated sugar chains on the pulmonary endothelium, which subsequently delivered the encapsulated nucleic acids to the endothelial cytosol via endosomal membrane fusion [123].\n\nSimilarly, Kim et al. reported that the addition of mannose to lipid nanoparticles enabled selective RNA delivery to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, as mannose receptors are preferentially expressed in the liver endothelium and therefore nanoparticles containing mannose on their surface would be scavenged by liver endothelial cells [93]. In the same form, Parhiz et al. and Marquez et al. demonstrated that the addition of PECAM-1 antibody or chondroitin sulfate allowed the selective delivery of LNPs to endothelial cells by targeting proteins ubiquitously expressed on the endothelium [96,157].\n\nOther reports have demonstrated that the addition of antibodies or binding peptides that target adhesion proteins on an activated endothelium directs LNPs to endothelial cells from different organs. One example of such work was produced by Kowalski et al. who showed that addition of anti-VCAM-1 antibodies to the surface of SAINT-O-Some lipid nanoparticles facilitated the delivery of siRNA to inflamed renal endothelial cells [129]. In the brain, nanocarriers functionalized with antibodies that recognize VCAM-1 successfully delivered thrombomodulin (TM)-encoding mRNA and mitigated TNF\u03b1-induced cerebral edema in a rat model [192].

            "text": "Another important physical parameter that contributes to the nanoparticle passive targeting of the liver, especially at the cellular level, is surface charge. While cationic nanoparticles have shown greater safety and biocompatibility concerns due to their strong membrane permeability and binding of negatively charged DNA, deviations towards either a positive or negative surface charge have shown significant effects on particle-cell interactions [35,36]. Highly cationic or anionic nanoparticles, for example, adsorb a significant amount of serum protein, resulting in aggregation and increased uptake by macrophages in vitro [37]. Kupffer cells and LSECs have also been shown to preferentially bind and clear negatively charged nanoparticles through interactions with scavenger receptors, such as stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 [38,39]. Conversely, hepatocytes demonstrate significant uptake of positively charged NPs over negatively charged ones [39]. The desired zeta potential for enhanced and targeted membrane interactions can be achieved either through material selection of choice, as in the case of many ionizable lipids, or chemical modifications [40]. However, it is important to note that protein binding to, e.g., albumin, formation of protein coronas, and interactions with phagocytes can change the synthetically given surface charge in vivo and subsequently influence liver cellular uptake [29,41]. Therefore, despite the role that electrostatic binding plays in liver uptake, the interplay is complex between the nanoparticles' different characteristics that ultimately determine their activity.",

            "text": "Specific liver-residing cells also display particle size preferences due to the impact of size on cellular internalization rates and mechanisms. For example, LSECs have been shown to engulf particles with a diameter of up to 200 nm due to their internalization method of receptor-mediated endocytosis [24,25]. This upper size limit is shown to facilitate intracellular accumulation in late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, an important mechanism for immunomodulation, within other non-phagocytic cells [25]. On the other hand, Kupffer cells, which can also utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis, preferentially uptake particles > 200 nm in the liver due to their phagocytic activity [25,26]. This creates a well-controlled dichotomy that makes up most of the liver's scavenger function. To access other liver cells, such as hepatocytes and HSCs, penetration through the liver sinusoidal fenestrae via the space of Diss\u00e9 may require minimization of nanoparticle size, ideally to <100 nm [27]. However, it has been shown that nanoparticles up to 400 nm have been able to extravasate into the space of Diss\u00e9 with a proper lipid composition of negatively charged phosphatidylserine [28]. \n\nRegarding shape, spherical nanoparticles are the most common particle shape and are shown to have some preferential accumulation in the lungs, liver, and spleen [21]. Most studies have additionally shown increased phagocytosis of spherical nanoparticles by macrophages compared to elongated ones [29]. PEG-bl-PPS micelle nanoparticles, for example, were shown to preferentially target liver phagocytes compared to more elongated fillomicelle nanoparticles [30]. Contrastingly, however, cylindrical silicon-based nanoparticles showed nearly two times higher accumulation in the liver than their spherical counterparts [31]. Therefore, while there is a strong impact of size and shape on liver targeting and biodistribution, more research needs to be conducted to discern their specific targeting impact and the varying influence different nanoparticle compositions may have on such impact.",

In particular, mannose receptors (CD206) have been attracting attention because they are expressed on immunocompetent cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as on vascular endothelial cells [90]. Applying this strategy, an attempt to modify the cell selectivity in the liver by mannose modification was also reported in LNPs [49]. The pharmacokinetics of general LNPs is determined by the formation of protein corona especially after systemic administration, as described above. To make active targeting dominant, it is necessary to inhibit the formation of protein corona. It has been reported that increasing the amount of PEG-lipids reduced the interaction with ApoE and the LDLR-mediated delivery to hepatocytes. Therefore, in the LNPs based on ionizable lipids, DOPE, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid, the amount of PEG-lipid was increased to 3%, which is higher than general LNPs, and 2.5% of it was replaced with mannose-modified PEG-lipid. In the evaluation of firefly luciferase mRNA as a reporter, the mannose modification of LNPs did not change the liver-specific protein expression. The cellular pattern of protein expression in the liver, however, changed significantly in an evaluation using LSL-tdTomato mice. In the original LNPs, the percentage of tdTomato-positive cells was~70% for hepatocytes,~10% for liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and~5% for Kupffer cells; in the mannose-modified LNPs, the percentage was~15% for hepatocytes,~70% for LSECs, and~15% for Kupffer cells.

            "text": "The liver is the major organ responsible for metabolizing carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, as well as for drug biotransformation and detoxification of endogenous and exogenous substances [1]. Additionally, it serves as a major site for the accumulation of nanoparticles (NPs), regardless of exposed route [2,3]. Studies indicate that 30~99% of the administered nanoparticles accumulate in the liver via diverse cell-dependent and cell-independent blood removal pathways [4], making it the key biofiltering organ [5]. NPs exposure may trigger liver injuries, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, inflammation, and metabolism disruption [2], etc. Since the liver is a primary target organ of NPs [4], a comprehensive understanding of NPs effects on the liver metabolism is crucial for biomedical applications. \n\nGold nanoparticles (GNPs) are considered as promising candidates for healthcare applications due to their distinctive optical and thermal characteristics along with tunable size, shape, and surface chemistry [6]. The GNPs surface can also be easily modified with a diverse array of small molecules such as nucleic acids, peptides, small interfering RNA, antibodies, polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), etc., [7] rendering them highly attractive material for nanomedicine [8,9]. Furthermore, the surface chemistry of GNPs can drastically govern their sub-organ biodistribution, transfer, and clearance profiles within the liver. Studies have demonstrated the pivotal role of surface chemistry in nanomaterials in regulating intracellular lipid metabolism [10]. This modification also impacts their uptake in the liver, particularly in hepatic Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatocyte, etc. [4]. Our previous study showed that gold nanoparticles (GNPs) capped with the different ligands, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), chitosan (CS) and polyethylenimine (PEI) capped exhibit distinct profiles of biodistribution, transfer, and clearance in the mouse liver [4,11,12].",

            "text": "Although reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1). The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake [4]. Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake [17]. The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells [30]. The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells [31]. Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm [32]; LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection [33]. \n\nAlternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation. In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

            "text": "of hepatocytes. Notably, the liver fenestrae diameter of rodents show high species and strain differences ranging from around 100 nm to 160 nm, possibly explaining positive liver targeting of published formulations (Braet and Wisse, 2002;Steffan et al., 1987;Wisse et al., 2008). In addition, a nanoparticle size above 100 nm triggers phagocytosis by cells of the reticuloendothelial system (i.e. hepatic Kupffer cells and spleen macrophages) resulting in rapid blood clearance (Kettiger et al., 2013). Both factors significantly decrease the likelihood of reaching the parenchymal liver tissue and increase the risk for potential off-target effects in untargeted tissues.\n\nSurface properties are another important characteristic of nanoparticles. The surface charge (i.e. z potential) should be slightly negative (Xiao et al., 2011) to prevent sequestration of particles in the lung (i.e. due to a positive charge) (Ishiwata et al., 2000) or rapid clearance by cells expressing scavenger receptors (i.e. due to an excessive negative charge) (Rothkopf et al., 2005). According to the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory of colloids, a neutral charge has to be avoided to prevent particle agglomeration. In addition to surface charge, steric stabilization by PEGylation mediates long circulating properties and prevents opsonization (Karmali and Simberg, 2011;Milla et al., 2012).\n\nIt was the aim of the present study to design and optimize a nanoparticle based on liposomes combined with derivatives of Myrcludex B to efficiently target hepatocytes while minimizing interactions with off-target cell types. Optimization of physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles included size and charge optimization and steric shielding by PEGylation. Derivatives of Myrcludex B were selected based on target binding, cellular uptake and their impact on the colloidal stability of nanoparticles.

The liver sinusoids are characterized by 100-200 nm fenestrations along the endothelial wall and absence of basal lamina, which results in the limitation of the particle size even after reaching the liver cells [42] . Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells, which are located in the space of Disse closing to the hepatocytes, are intrinsic parts of the reticuloendothelial system [43] . In terms of liver passive targeting delivery systems, polymeric nanoparticle [44 ,45] , albumin nanoparticle [46 ,47] , liposome [48 ,49] and solid lipid nanoparticle [50 ,51] have been developed for the past few years.

However, liver diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer are prevalent and can be life-threatening. LNPs have been shown to selectively accumulate in the liver due to their uptake and clearance by liver macrophages, the largest population of phagocytes in the body. Moreover, the interplay between LNPs and plasma proteins substantially influences their systemic clearance dynamics post-administration. Therefore, liver-targeted delivery using LNPs represents a promising avenue for the treatment of liver-related diseases, as it can minimize the occurrence of side effects and improve the efficacy of therapeutic agents. \n\nIn the past few years, LNPs always selectively accumulate in the liver, which correlates with nanoparticle uptake and clearance by liver macrophages, the largest population of phagocytes in the body. 152 In addition, the interaction of LNPs with plasma proteins plays an important role in the clearance process of LNPs after entering the body. 153 ost of the studies on carriers selectively delivered to the liver are conducted from ApoE, which promotes receptormediated cellular entry. 99 A recent study indicated that the binding of ApoE can induce the rearrangement of the shell and core lipids of LNPs containing mRNA. 154 According to Zheng et al., 155 the ability to attain liver targeting can be accomplished by systematically refining the nanoparticle vector formulation using the central composite design approach. \n\nThe human liver is primarily composed of parenchymal cells and nonparenchymal cells. Focusing on these specific cell types provides a precise approach to treating disease. Liver parenchymal cells are commonly implicated in hepatitis especially the HBV and other related diseases, whereas nonparenchymal cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells, 156 are closely associated with chronic liver conditions like liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. 157,158",

Therefore, hepatocyte-targeting NPs need to circumvent unwanted uptake by the aforementioned liver NPC populations. \n\nThis review aims to summarize the strategies currently evaluated in preclinical in vivo models for the treatment of liver diseases with nanoformulations that may allow the poor solubility of drugs to be overcome by encapsulation and enable the codelivery of distinct compounds that act on different signaling pathways or effector molecules into the same cell to yield synergistic effects [16,17]. Consequently, nanoformulations are also intended to prevent systemic toxicity, as frequently observed, e.g., for systemically applied anti-cancer drugs [18,19]. Therefore, nanoformulations need to address their cellular target either via passive or active targeting [20]. Whereas the former is determined by the intrinsic properties of the NP-like size and charge, active targeting is achieved by the attachment of receptor-binding moieties on the NP surface. For the treatment of liverassociated disorders, nanoformulations need to exert disease-specific biological effects; for instance, in the case of virus-induced hepatitis nano-vaccines aim to evoke antiviral immune responses [21,22], whereas in the case of autoimmune hepatitis nanodrugs are intended to dampen inflammation [23]. \n\nLiver fibrosis, i.e., the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins due to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), is commonly observed in the course of chronic liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [24]. Extensive liver fibrosis may result in cirrhosis, which, in turn, predisposes the liver to HCC [25]. Hence, a number of nanoformulations that revert HSC activation are under development.",

            "text": "Innate immunoreactivity driven by PRR within the liver occurs in three main cell types: hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) (Figure 4). Within these cell types, oligonucleotide immune reactivity (TLR3/7/8/9) is most predominant in LSECs and KCs (Figure 4) [46][47][48]. PS modification of ASOs and NAPs drives their accumulation primarily in the liver and kidney [49][50][51][52] and is not affected by 2 ribose modification. Within the liver, the majority of ASO/NAP accumulation occurs in LSECs, with smaller accumulations in KC and hepatocytes (Figure 4) [53]. The PS modification is only very sparingly used in siRNA and as such, even when stabilized with a variety of 2 ribose modifications, very little accumulation occurs in the liver. First generation siRNA drugs used lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. LNP-siRNA complexes with apolipoprotein E (Apo E) following administration and transits LSECs and KCs silently to deliver naked siRNA with high specificity and selectivity into hepatocytes (Figure 4) [54][55][56]. Unfortunately, LNPs also have proinflammatory effects in the liver [57], ultimately resulting in their discontinuation in clinical development for more recent siRNA drugs. Modern ASO and siRNA drugs in development now employ conjugation with a triennial N-acetylglucosamine moiety (GalNAc) to achieve delivery to hepatocytes [58]. This conjugation approach significantly improves the fraction of ASOs accumulating in hepatocytes and circumvents the proinflammatory effects of LNPs. However, a significant minority (~30%) of GalNAc-conjugated ASOs and siRNAs are delivered to LSEC and KC [59,60].",

[32,35] Uptake in CD-31 stained vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells or SE-1 stained liver sinusoidal cells was observed only in rare cases, in slices where these cell types were present in the outer cell layers (Figures S10 and S11, Supporting Information). A preferential uptake in Kupffer cells was also observed on murine liver slices exposed to the same nanoparticles (Figure S12, Supporting Information). \n\nIt is important to compare these observations with in vivo intrahepatic distribution studies. As an example, using polystyrene microsphere of 50 and 500 nm, Ogawara et al [32] found that after IV injection, within the liver 60-70% of the particles were taken up by Kupffer cells. However, uptake in parenchymal and endothelial cells was also present (28% and 13%, respectively, for the smaller particles and 5% and 24% for the larger ones). Similar results were obtained on mice by Park et al [36] with PLGA particles, which were taken up by Kupffer cells with highest efficiency, although uptake was present also in liver sinusoidal cells and hepatic stellate cells, and-to much lower extent-in hepatocytes. Similar results were reported by Dragoni et al [14] after injection of gold nanoparticles in rat. Lee et al. [37] compared the distribution of silica nanoparticles with different surface functionalization within the liver after IP injection in mice. They also found the highest accumulation in the Kupffer cells. However, uptake in liver sinusoidal cells was also comparable. On the contrary, Sadauskas et al [38] studied the distribution of gold nanoparticles within the liver in mice after IV and IP injection and found uptake only in Kupffer cells. \n\nOverall, these studies indicate that within the liver in most cases the Kupffer cells show higher accumulation of nanoparticles.",

            "text": "The mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15). Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.",

            "text": "A platform technology that delivers RNA therapeutics to targeted cells has great potential for treating various liver diseases associated with different types of cells in the liver. In particular, LSECs participate in initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases by change in their pathological characteristics in response to chemical toxins, cytokines, and inflammatory stimuli (17,19). Previous studies have shown that targeting endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and Bax in LSECs could also reduce apoptosis of LSECs and eventually reduced acute hepatic failure (43,44). The conjugation of hyaluronan, KLGR peptide, and mannose resulted in increased uptake of nano particles into LSECs compared to nonconjugated groups. Moreover, previously reported studies have confirmed that LNPs can be delivered to different tissue by changing LNP formulations. Some of these formulations showed increased mRNA delivery to LSECs without targeting ligands (45). Nevertheless, its selectivity remained not well understood (37). \n\nTo translate the targeted delivery to LSECs, ApoE-dependent cellular uptake must be replaced by alternative ligand selection and incorporation. Upon entering blood circulation system, LNPs can be readily delivered to hepatocytes and LSECs by ApoE-dependent cellular uptake. However, delivery efficacy of LNPs in LSECs is significantly less than that of hepatocytes (23). Here, we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction. It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.",

Cellular uptake of adenoviral vectors after systemic gene transfer occurs predominantly in nonparenchymal liver cells (i.e. mainly liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells) [28]. It was demonstrated that uptake of vectors by non-parenchymal liver cells (i.e. mainly liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells) inversely correlates with transduction of parenchymal liver cells [28]. Depletion of Kupffer cells and macrophages in the liver by intravenous administration of clodronate liposomes results in significantly increased transgene DNA levels in parenchymal liver cells [28] and in increased transgene expression [28]. Besides clodronate liposomes, preadministration of polyinosinic acid, a scavenger receptor A ligand, before gene transfer has been shown to prevent sequestration of adenoviral vectors in Kupffer cells and to enhance parenchymal liver cell transduction [29]. The liver transduction we've obtained, using only 10 7 BoHV-4-based vector particles and without intervention to decrease the uptake of the vector in the liver reticulo-endotelial cells, can be considered satisfactory. This Histological examination of livers from inoculated mice indicated that BoHV-4-A-EGFPDTK the infected/transduced liver were hepatocytes and not Kupffer cells (KC) or sinusoidal endothelial cells (liver sinusoidal endothelial cell, LSEC), which are those responsible for the clearance of viral particles [17]. A possible explanation for this surprising behavior could be that the viral fraction sequestered by KC or LSEC lost the transduction ability due to inactivation by the phagocytic activity of those cells, and thus, GFP could not be expressed. Whereas the GFP expressed in the hepatocytes could derive from the remaining viral fraction that escaped KC or LSEC phagocytosis, and thus maintained infection/transduction ability.

For instance, for nanoparticles containing anionic phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidic acid, researchers have observed more specific delivery to the spleen (60%, 50%, and 75%, respectively) than to the liver (20%, 45%, and 5%, respectively) (LoPresti et al., 2022). On the other hand, another group of authors (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022) has reported that for LNPs containing phosphatidylglycerol, accumulation in the liver occurs predominantly in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, in contrast to phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs, whose accumulation takes place equally in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells. \n\nThe introduction of an additional charged helper lipid as a fifth component also enables investigators to alter targeting efficiency of LNPs. Not so long ago (Dilliard et al., 2021), scientists achieved almost 100% reporter mRNA expression in the liver, spleen, or lungs by means of an additional neutral, negatively, or positively charged lipid, respectively. Targeting to an organ depended there on apparent pK a of nanoparticles: at pK a < 5, the particles accumulated mainly in the spleen; at pK a of 6.2-6.4, mainly in the liver; whereas at pK a > 11, mainly in lungs. It is noteworthy that at pK a of 6.5-11, there was selective distribution of LNPs into the lungs and spleen at different levels, indicating a nonobvious dependence of the LNP biodistribution on the charge. It is likely that pK a can serve as a good predictor of bioactivity. For classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used.",

Although YSK05-LNP and YSK05/12-LNP have a similar biodistribution, as shown in Figure S2, in which the lipids and siRNA of both types of LNPs were visualized by Fluo-rVivo imaging and were found to be largely distributed to liver tissues, the intrahepatic distribution of those LNPs varied and was determined by their pKa value. The intrahepatic distribution was shifted substantially from hepatocytes (with YSK05-LNP [pKa 6.50; Figure 6, upper]) into LSECs (with YSK05/12-LNP [pKa 7.15; Figure 6, lower]). However, we observed that traces of the YSK05/12-LNP were distributed into hepatocytes and liver resident macrophages (Kupffer cells). Furthermore, the biodistribution of YSK05/12-LNP to the lung and spleen was minimal (only a weak siRNA fluorescent intensity was detected in lungs [Figure S2]) and its silencing activity in lung and spleen endothelia was weak (Figure S1). The selectivity of the YSK05/12-LNP for the liver endothelium over the lung or spleen endothelium can be attributed to the special scavenging character of LSECs, which have a very high endocytic capacity and are responsible for the uptake of soluble or colloidal materials and nanoparticles that are not large enough to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. 16,17,20,46,47",

            "text": "Depletion of Kupffer cells to minimize liver sequestration and enhance nanoparticle circulation to target tissues. For example, clodronate liposomes are used to selectively target macrophages, resulting in their depletion. [40] Hepatocytes are the main parenchymal cells of the liver, responsible for liver-specific metabolic functions, including the synthesis of proteins (e.g., albumin), detoxification, and lipid metabolism. Because of interactions with LDL receptors, these cells are highly permeable to LNPs, especially those smaller than 100 nm in diameter. ApoE-coated LNPs bind to LDL receptors and allow LNP uptake into hepatocytes. 23 The heterogeneity of hepatocytes is also remarkable; they exhibit zonation across the liver acinus, with different metabolic roles depending on their location. 34 Hepatocyte zonation influences LNP behavior. Zone 1 (periportal) hepatocytes perform oxidative metabolism, while Zone 3 (pericentral) hepatocytes specialize in detoxification and lipid metabolism. Zone 3 hepatocytes enhance ApoE-mediated LNP uptake through higher LDL receptor expression. 23 Smaller LNPs (<100 nm) use the fenestrations in LSECs to target Zone 3, while the proximity of Zone 1 to blood flow facilitates rapid uptake. 30,31 Therapeutic designs should consider the specific functions of hepatocyte zonation: for example, targeting Zone 3 for detoxification therapies due to its role in lipid and xenobiotic detoxification, and Zone 1 for metabolic disorders because of its focus on oxidative metabolism. 41 Moreover, variations in ploidy among hepatocytes are vital in their spatial and functional specialization. This adds another dimension to the complexity of liver zonation, shaping critical metabolic processes, for example, lipid metabolism and the clearance of nanoparticles. 34,42 ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids.",

Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.",

            "text": "The non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) consist of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KCs) and stellate cells (169). The nutrient-rich blood from the hepatic portal vein and oxygen-rich blood from the hepatic artery meet in the sinusoidal blood vessels (170). During this process, the LSECs of the sinusoidal vessels assist in clearing macromolecular waste and regulating hepatic vascularity (171). Other than most endothelial cells, LSECs possess a higher endocytic ability. As an example, 45% of all pinocytic vesicles are attributed to LSECs and LSECs are shown to be more efficient in absorbing/internalizing circulating antigens than dendritic cells or macrophages of the spleen and Kupffer cells and dendritic cells of the liver (172)(173)(174). LSECs are able to filter the blood via selective exchange of molecules in the blood and underlying stellate and hepatocytes due to their fenestrated morphology (175). Due to the lack of a basement membrane or basal lamina, there is direct access to the space of Disse (perisinusoidal space) for interaction between blood and hepatocyte or stellate cells (176). The LECs fenestrae have the ability to change their diameter according to as a response to the cellular microenvironment (177). The fenestrae are maintained by cooperative paracrine and autocrine signalling of hepatocytes and stellate cells. VEGF, NO and serotonin pathways have been shown to be involved in the maintenance and regulation of contraction or dilation of the fenestrae (178,179). Loss or reduction fenestrae number in LSECs is referred to as defenestration (177). Defenestration leads to reduced hepatic uptake of lipoproteins which can cause hypolipoproteinemia (180). Subsequently, defenestration is involved in multiple disorders like liver fibrosis, atherosclerosis, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",

In the BBR-C TA-Mic treated group, we can see strong activation of InsR. However, the insulin signaling was not stimulated because phosphorylation of AKT was not induced. \n\nReviewer #4: Remarks to the Author: \n\nIn the revised manuscript, the authors have addressed a number of concerns raised by Reviewer #2 during the initial review. The newly added experiments, such as using ultra-centrifugal filter to evaluate the integrity of the micelles after transportation across the C aco cell layer and dosedependent effect of BBR-C TA-Mic on gene expression in the liver, are useful additions and address some of the technical concerns. On the other hand, one major issue does remain. The authors claimed that BBR-C TA-Mic had preferential engagement in hepatocytes other than Kupffer cells, endothelial cells and stellate cells. This is in contrary to common observations. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC s) and Kupffer cells are prominent cell types in liver for clearance of nanoparticles in blood circulation, and LSEC s are the first cells encountered by nanoparticles when coming up from the portal vein (Ref: Park J-K, et al., Nanomedicine-NBM, 2016, 12, 1365). Then how does BBR-C TA-Mic escape from LSEC s and Kupffer cells needs to be clarified. This is relevant to the scientific impact of the manuscript. The accuracy of the method used in Supplementary Fig. 7 is in doubt. A more reliable method is to stain the liver cell suspensions with cell markers for various cells and then calculate the double positive cell populations with BBR-C TA-Mic using flow cytometry.",

            "text": "When the properties of the nanospheres were adjusted with a hydrophilic coating (~200\u2212220 nm diameter, ~0 mV surface charge) the intrasplenic distribution of capture in mice shifted to the red pulp, presumably due to changes in the opsonic response to the hydrophilic coatings that affected the specific cellular interactions with the nanospheres [76,78]. In the sinusoidal structures of rat and human livers (but not mice), the splenic interendothelial cell slits (200-500 nm) in the walls of venous sinuses act as a sieving mechanism for entrapping and accumulating nondeformable nanomaterials of equal or greater sizes in the red pulp [78,79]. The relationships between nanomaterial properties and splenic accumulation across different species has been reviewed in depth elsewhere [74]. \n\nLiver. The liver capillaries of mice, rats, and humans are all sinusoidal with open endothelial fenestrae separating the sinusoidal lumen and the space of Disses where the hepatic parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) reside. However, the number of fenestrae per \u03bcm 2 and the diameters differs among species: the average diameter of fenestrae is ~99 nm in mice and rats, but is between 50-300 nm in humans, and the density of fenestrae/\u03bcm 2 is 14, 20, and 20 in mice, rats, and humans, respectively [80]. The influences of these anatomical differences on the intrahepatic distribution and hepatobiliary clearance of nanomaterials between species has not be studied in depth. Reports on the species dependent hepatic uptake of liposomes in mice, rats, and rabbits noted that liposome uptake in rats was dependent on specific plasma opsonins whereas mice exhibited opsonin independent uptake [81,82]. Although, species specificity has also been reported in the activity of particular opsonins against liposomes too [82]. No significant differences have been observed in the density of Kupffer cells in mouse, rat, and rabbit livers [81].",

LSECs, which are the physical barrier that separate liver tissues from the blood flow, 16,17 have significant roles under normal conditions, including providing a selective and permeable barrier, facilitating the transport of metabolites and waste clearance, [18][19][20] regulating hepatic blood flow, maintaining a low portal pressure, 21 and keeping hepatic stellate cells in their inactivated state to prevent fibrosis. 22 ][29][30][31] Therefore, LSECs are possible drug targets for preventing or treating related liver disorders, especially those associated with genetic disturbances. Based on our previous observations, LSECs take up LNPs with higher pKa values, in the pKa range tested (5.70-7.25). 32 However, higher pKa values were not examined and the optimum pKa value for targeting LSECs is not currently known. \n\nWe previously developed an LNP composed of different types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids, namely YSK lipids (referred to as YSK-LNP), to deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo, particularly in hepatocytes. 33,34 In our previous study, slightly cationic LNP formulations that were composed of lipids with high pKa values, such as YSK13-C4 (pKa 6.80) and YSK15-C4 (pKa 7.10), were found to be highly localized in LSECs as opposed to hepatocytes. 32 Nevertheless, they showed a weak gene silencing activity in LSECs, possibly due to their inactivation by endothelial lipase (EL). 32 his prompted us to investigate the feasibility of targeting LSECs using lipase-resistant LNPs in which the membrane had optimized pKa values.",

Kupffer cells mainly took up NPs (38%), followed by HSCs (29%) LSECs (29%), and hepatocytes (4%) in hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver. LSECs were the primary cells taking up NPs (41%), followed by Kupffer cells (36%), HSCs (21%), and hepatocytes (2%) in hydrophobic-NP-PBS treated liver. The hierarchy of NP uptake in hydrophobic-NP-olive oil treated liver was LSECs (39%) > Kupffer cells (32%) > HSCs (26%) > hepatocytes (3%). \n\nLSECs are highly specialized endothelial cells compared with normal continuous endothelial cells in the vessels [27]. LSECs form a permeable barrier, at the interface between the sinusoidal vessels and the space of Disse [28,29]. Therefore, LSECs were regarded as an important barrier to overcoming NP delivery to HSCs or hepatocytes. NP delivery to HSCs and hepatocytes can be impaired by strong endocytosis of LSECs, as well as phagocytosis of Kupffer cells, as evidenced in a previous literature review [30]. This implies a possible convenience of Kupffer cells and LSECs for targeting by NPs, due to their location and strong phagocytic and endocytic activity [31,32]. Based on our results, hydrophobic NP surface modification would be appropriate for targeting LSECs. \n\nHydrophilic silica NPs seem to be more appropriate to target HSCs rather than LSECs. The number of NP-positive HSCs in the hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver was significantly highest among all NP-treated livers (Figure 5B), and so hydrophilic surface-modified NPs might be more likely to reach HSCs when compared with the hydrophobic surface-modified NPs.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle size, for example, has demonstrated a significant impact on targeting since anatomical access to hepatocytes requires access to the space of Diss\u00e9 via small fenestrae and avoidance of liver reticuloendothelial cells, which sequester most liver-reaching nanoparticles [24]. Therefore, a proposed <100 nm diameter has been suggested [24,113]. Hepatocyte-targeting has also been achieved with nanoparticle coating and compositions. Cholesterol-TWEEN 80 unilamellar vesicles and lipopeptide cKK-E12 showed preferential uptake by hepatocytes over sinusoidal cells while cKK-E12 lipoprotein NPs displayed gene silencing selectivity in hepatocytes over nonliver organs, liver endothelial cells, and liver leukocytes [113,114]. Hepatocyte-specific ligands have also been difficult to identify (Figure 4D). The most popularly implemented is the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) due to its primary expression on hepatocytes, at ~1.8 million receptors/cell, and minimal expression on extrahepatic cells [14]. With a high affinity for N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), galactose (Gal), and glucose, ASGPR has been tested for targeting with these and modified versions of these ligands, such as asialofetuin-PEG residue and galactosylated chitosan [115][116][117]. However, because Kupffer cells also demonstrate Gal/GalNAc scavenging, they could divert nanoparticles intended for hepatocytes [14]. Although less specific, glycyrrhizin/glycyrrhetinic acid receptors found on hepatocyte membranes, as well as kidney, stomach, and colon cells have also been targeted [118]. Glycyrrhizin-modified chitosan NPs, for example, have shown preferential endocytosis by hepatocytes over hepatic non-parenchymal cells [119].",

Nevertheless, many of the targeted drug delivery systems do not necessarily be accumulated sufficiently in the intrahepatic target cell-type such as myofibroblasts, because of high non-specific uptake by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells that are mostly active in the uptake of (nano)particulates. In the liver, the drug first enters via blood circulation to sinusoids and then reaches perisinusoidal space, where hepatocytes are located. Hepatocytes, comprises of about 80% of the total resident hepatic cells in healthy liver, are strategic key cells in a wide range of liver diseases and are actively involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs entering the liver. In addition to hepatocytes, Kupffer cells (sinusoidal macrophages) accounts for 15% of total healthy liver cell population and constitutes 80-90% of the tissue-resident macrophages in the whole body. They are active in immune defenses by removing not only dangerous foreign compounds, but also many large molecular-weight drugs entering the liver via circulation [105]. Rapid uptake and complete degradation of many biological compounds by Kupffer cells make them challenging barriers to systemic delivery of therapeutics [106]. Also, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), present close to hepatocytes within the space of Disse, like Kupffer cells have high phagocytic ability which has a fundamental role in immune system and host defense. As already mentioned, HSCs are the important fibrogenic cells of liver, playing major role in liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. However, the drugs that enter the liver will not necessarily reach the intended target cell type. Since HSCs are located in the space of Disse between endothelial cells and hepatocytes, the (targeted) drug-conjugates should pass sinusoidal endothelial barriers, and escape Kupffer cells and hepatocytes uptake to be accumulated selectively in HSCs for therapeutic efficacy [107].",

            "text": "As the largest digestive organ in the body, the liver plays a central role in metabolism, mainly performed by hepatocytes, one type of parenchymal cells, in which lesion of hepatocytes often causes serious metabolic diseases, such as Wilson disease, Gilben syndrome, etc. In addition, some hepatic non-parenchymal cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) also trigger serious hepatic diseases. For instance, LSECs play a key role in the initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma development. 27 ucleic acid drugs offer unique advantages over conventional chemical and protein-based drugs and represent a new approach to treating liver diseases. Targeting hepatocytes is relatively straightforward because LNPs are naturally taken up by hepatocytes through the interaction of serum ApoE adsorbed on the LNPs' surface and LDLR on the hepatocyte surfaces, facilitating cellular endocytosis. 28 Consistent with the theory, unmodified LNPs have been found to be widely distributed in the liver after systemic administration. 29 In addition, the hepatocellular targeting ability of LNPs can be significantly enhanced by optimizing lipid composition and LNPs formulation. For instance, a study by H. Lee and colleagues found that LNPs containing 1.5% PEGylated lipids exhibited approximately 80% transfection efficiency, the highest hepatocyte uptake, among LNPs formulations containing PEGylated lipids ranging from 1 to 3%. 30 Also, it has been reported that by constructing helper lipids 31 and ILs libraries, it was possible to identify mRNA/siRNA-LNPs with superior liver targeting and enrichment properties. James E. Dahlman's group reported that LNPs containing stereopure 20a-hydroxycholesterol (20a) showed a more robust capacity to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes than control at a low dose. 32 However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR.",

            "text": "The liver is considered a crucial organ of the body due to its involvement in numerous processes, such as metabolism, immunity, detoxification, nutrient storage, among others. The liver is composed primarily of four distinct cell types, differentiated into two categories as parenchymal cells (PC, 60-80%) and non-parenchymal cells . The NPC population is composed of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells/LSECs (50%), Kupffer cells/KCs (20%) and stellate cells (<1%). The remaining NPCs are composed of lymphocytes (25%) and biliary cells (5%) (Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006). The role of hepatocytes, KCs and stellate cells in maintaining liver homeostasis is well documented. However, the LSEC, is the most understudied due to technical challenges in purification and culturing ex vivo. \n\nProf. Eddie Wisse first proposed the ultrastructure of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) in 1970, which differentiated LSECs from KCs and paved the way for future study on LSECs and elucidation of their function (Wisse, 1970(Wisse, , 1972)). A few years later, several research groups developed LSEC isolation techniques and identified their role in the uptake of various substances in vitro (Seglen, 1976;Smedsrod et al., 1984). In the early 1980s, LSECs were identified as a significant clearance site for blood-borne hyaluronan, which established their role as scavenger cells (Fraser et al., 1981). This led to an increase in interest among scientists from other discipline, such as immunology, virology, cancer, and more to further comprehend the various roles performed by LSECs. This review focuses on the detailed description of LSEC morphology and their scavenger, adhesion and other prominent receptors that define their functional roles in the hematological and hepatic systems during health and disease.",

While the bulk of fCNT are renally cleared [6][7][8][9][10][11] , the next most prominent organ contributing to their accumulation and elimination is the liver. Data reported herein show the unexpected result that liver processed fCNT either by receptor-mediated LSEC scavenging or hepatobiliary elimination. Hepatic biocompatibity of these nanomaterials was confirmed in rodents and primates and is now explained by a combination of specific LSEC scavenging and intact biliary clearance. Hepatic and renal processing and clearance of this fibrillar nanomaterial are advantageous biological properties. \n\nGiven the important role of the liver in mammalian physiology and homoeostasis, the absence of fCNT in parenchyma was an interesting and potentially significant finding that correlated with the observed biocompatibility of these covalently functionalized nanomaterials [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][33][34][35] . The va ious nonparenchymal cells that populate the liver sinusoid are interleaved and difficult to distinguish morphologically with light microscopic examination. However, in this study we employed specific multiple IF stains to identify and differentiate between Kupffer cells, LSEC  fCNT are scavenged by LSEC via a Stabilin receptor-mediated process. Our physicochemical characterizations indicated that fCNT is soluble and well dispersed in physiologic milieu and behaved like a fibrillar macromolecule rather than particulates which would be expected to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells 38 . Accordingly, we observed no evidence of Kupffer clearance of fCNT using discrete cell markers to interrogate and unequivocally identify each sinusoidal cell phenotype. Furthermore, we confirmed that Kupffer cells did not express either Stabilin receptor which explained the lack of fCNT clearance by this resident macrophage.",

Therefore, unless the liver is the intended target organ of functionalized NP, for example in the case of treatment of liver fibrosis [12] or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [13], the role of the liver as an obstacle in nano-vaccination needs to be elucidated. \n\nThis review aims to summarize knowledge on the immunoregulatory activity of liver non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) with a focus on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) and on their interaction with systemically applied NP. In case of nano-vaccines that are employed to induce, e.g., antitumor responses, unwanted engagement by liver NPCs may result in tolerance-promoting effects. However, NP-based immunotherapeutic strategies may also aim to exploit the default tolerogenic function of liver NPCs for therapy of autoimmune diseases and allergies. Moreover, functionalized NPs have been used to reprogram liver macrophages with regulatory functions towards a proinflammatory state for tumor therapy.",

            "text": "The endothelial system of liver with fenestrae is different from other tissues, which endows nanodrugs with unique advantages for therapeutic purposes (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, modification of nanodrugs in terms of physical (including size, shape, and uniformity), chemical (including composition, charge, and surface coating) and biological (including encapsulated compounds and specific conjugated ligands) features facilitate their efficient and selective targeting of pathology sites [141,142]. Nanodrugs cannot penetrate the vascular endothelial system of normal non-hepatic tissues (Fig. 6B) and nanoparticles tend to accumulate and target lesions with incomplete endothelial lining and basement membrane [143][144][145][146]. Overall, 30-99% nanodrugs are reported to aggregate in the liver after administration into the body via different routes [147]. \n\nDue to the fenestrated sieve plates between LSECs, which range from 50 to 180 nm in humans or up to 280 nm in mice and rats [5], smaller nanodrugs directly pass the sinusoid into disse of space. Nanodrugs are also taken up by LSECs through receptor-ligand interactions and subsequently LSECs transported to disse of space if not consumed. Subsequently, nanodrugs in the disse interact with hepatocytes, leading to their uptake. Modification of nanodrugs, such as alterations in targeting molecules, PEGylation, and imparting positive charges on the surface, can also greatly increase uptake by hepatocytes [148,149]. In addition, larger nanoparticles tend to be captured by KCs after entering hepatic sinusoids through portal vein or hepatic artery due to their greater surface area for interactions [147,150]. Considering the critical role of KC-related inflammation in liver injury, enrichment of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant nanoparticles in KCs also provides favorable conditions for treatment (Fig. 6C). Notably, sinusoid capillarization occurs when LSECs are injured during liver injury, especially chronic liver injury and liver fibrosis.",

            "text": "After 1 h, DY-635 was mainly eliminated through the hepatobiliary system as indicated by the stained gall bladder and gastrointestinal lumen (Fig 2G). \n\nThe liver consists of various cell types controlling metabolism and the immune response. Kupffer cells (the liver macrophage population) and liver-specific endothelial cells (LSECs) have been shown to sequester nanocarriers (Press et al, 2014;Tavares et al, 2017;Campbell et al, 2018). Both cell types would be considered \"off-target\" for our delivery strategy since they strongly contribute to the immune response against invading microorganisms. Therefore, cell-type-specific targeting of loaded liposomes within the liver was further investigated by time-lapse intravital microscopy (Fig 2 H). This method enables differentiation of parenchymal (hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal (Kupffer cells, LSECs) within the liver due to their different shape, location, and NAD(P)H fluorescence. After intravenous injection, T-LipoAS started to appear in the capillary system (sinusoids;Fig 2H). T-LipoAS then rapidly accumulated within hepatocytes. Clearance of nanocarriers by Kupffer cells or LSECs can be identified with this method via monitoring of lineshaped patterns or spots at the interphase between NADPH-positive hepatocytes and the sinusoids (Guidolin & Zheng, 2019;Cinar et al, 2020). No signal of T-LipoAS accumulated at these locations. The appearance of line structures within the hepatocytes indicates the accumulation of DY-635 in bile canaliculi, the microscopic structure formed by hepatocytes within the bile drainage pathway, further confirming the hepatobiliary elimination of DY-635. The apparent absence of DY-635 fluorescence associated with non-parenchymal cells in the liver in combination with the appearance of DY-635 derived from T-LipoAS within hepatocytes and canaliculi indicates a highly selective uptake and processing of targeted nanocarriers through hepatocytes.",

Within the liver, the use of a specific receptor-targeted ligand can be useful to distinguish between the different hepatic cells and prevent an accumulation in Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages in this organ. Thus, trivalent GalNAc conjugates increase uptake into hepatocytes and consequently gene silencing in this cell type [98]. The asialoglycoprotein receptor is characterized by efficient endocytosis. Nanoparticles with close to neutral and anionic charges have been described to decrease the adsorption of serum proteins, leading to increased circulation half-lives [99]. Kataoka et al. reported that neutral and anionic nanoparticles tend to circulate for longer periods of time and subsequently lead to lower accumulation in the spleen and other organs [100]. Meanwhile, cationic nanoparticles have been shown to have increased cellular localization in most of the cells as shown in Figure 8",

However, other cell types which are part of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES), such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) also represent interesting targets for nucleic acid therapeutics. Although KCs are very effective in removing and destroying nanosystems, they are much more difficult to be productively transfected with commonly used nucleic acid carriers. Therefore, several attempts were made to enable nucleic acid delivery to these cell types, including receptor-targeting strategies as well as the development of novel lipids for LNPs aiming for chemical targeting (Fig. 4).",

This was confirmed in portal hypertension of rats with NASH (88). In addition, simvastatin administration for 15 days in aged cirrhotic rats improves the hepatic sinusoidal milieu, demonstrating its therapeutic potential in advanced chronic liver disease (93). Simvastatin restores the quiescence of aHSCs via stimulation of KLF2-NO signaling in LSECs (97). Treatment with the pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (pan-PPAR) agonist lanifibranor demonstrates phenotypic improvement in a rat model of cBDL as well as in human hepatocytes from patients with cirrhosis (98). Although further validation is needed in human trials, it paves a way to develop novel drugs that target both HSCs and LSECs to treat liver fibrosis. \n\nThe property of containing numerous receptors to endocytose soluble macromolecules and small particles (20) makes LSECs suitable for specific drug delivery. To date, several modified polymers targeting LSECs have been developed to delivery drugs. Hide et al (99) designed simvastatin-loaded polymeric micelles to treat chronic liver disease and showed promising results, thus suggesting that nanoparticles are a promising therapeutic approach. On the other hand, liver sinusoidal capillarization and ECM deposition are dual pathological barriers to drug delivery (20), Zhang et al (100) constructed an efficient nanodrug delivery system with LSEC-targeting and fenestrae-repairing nanoparticles (named HA-NPs/SMV) on the basis of the modification with hyaluronic acid.",

This has been elegantly shown by Hoshino et al. (2015), who performed proteomic analysis of 28 organ-specific metastatic cell line-derived small-EVs. Integrins were the largest group of highly abundant adhesion molecules and liver tropism was conferred by the expression of integrin \u03b1v\u03b25 on small-EVs, which particularly associated with Kupffer cells (90% of small-EV positive cells). \n\nInterestingly, when all macrophages were depleted by pre-injecting clodronate liposomes into mice, IV administered B16BL6 cell-derived small-EVs still distributed to the liver, which suggested that non-macrophage cells are also involved in the uptake of small-EVs in the liver (Imai et al., 2015). Apart from the uptake by Kupffer cells, a recent study has shown that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) can also take up hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-derived small-EVs (Wan et al., 2019).",

A notable functional characteristic of LSECs is their high endocytic capacity compared to other endothelial cells, playing a key role in the elimination of macromolecules and residual nanoparticles carried by the blood. LSECs have a structure with small pores that facilitate the passage of molecules between the blood and hepatocytes but also allows for the capture of larger particles. This helps filter substances present in the blood that circulate through the hepatic sinusoids. They express several types of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including scavenger receptors, which are particularly important for capturing modified lipoproteins, immune complexes, fragments of dead cells, and molecular debris. These receptors allow LSECs to identify and internalize substances that need to be eliminated from the bloodstream, capturing macromolecules, cellular debris, and nanoparticles. These cells recognize nanoparticles as foreign particles and phagocytize them before they reach the target tissue. This can reduce the amount of nanoparticles that reach the desired location, decreasing the effectiveness of the treatment. They can also reduce the circulation time of nanoparticles in the blood by capturing them quickly, especially if the nanoparticles do not have coatings that protect them from this capture. This is particularly problematic for treatments that require prolonged distribution or accumulation in specific target tissues [68,71]. \n\nTo avoid early capture by scavenger cells, nanoparticles can be modified with coatings that reduce recognition by these cells. Stealth nanocarriers are drug delivery systems designed to evade detection by the immune system, prolonging their circulation in the body and enhancing the efficiency of transporting active substances to target sites, such as specific tissues or cells [72]. These nanocarriers have the ability to escape elimination by the reticuloendothelial system, especially by phagocytic cells in the liver and spleen, which normally detect and remove foreign particles from the blood.",

            "text": "Understanding liver fibrosis implies knowing how the ECM proteins change during this process, as well as how the cellular players interact with each other. The main cell types in the liver are hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, HSC, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and cholangiocytes (Figure 1). \n\nHepatocytes are the major parenchymal cell type in the liver and account for 80-90% of the cells in the liver. As such, they perform the majority of liver functions, including nutrient metabolism and detoxification [22,23]. Cholangiocytes are a small epithelial cell population (3-5%) that lines up the bile duct system [24]. Their role involves the secretion and absorption of water, electrolytes, and organic solutes [25,26]. Kupffer cells are the resident macrophages of the liver and largest resident macrophage population in the body (80-90%) [27,28]. They have a high endocytic and phagocytic capacity, and they play a crucial homeostatic role in the hepatic immune system [29]. LSECs are fenestrated and form a permeable barrier between the blood and the hepatocytes and HSC which facilitates the passage of molecules from the sinusoidal endothelium to the liver parenchyma and contributes to the maintenance of the cellular and hemodynamic homeostasis [30]. HSCs are resident liver cells located in the socalled space of Disse between LSECs and hepatocytes [31\u2022\u2022]. In the healthy liver, HSCs are present in a quiescent state, are a reservoir of retinoic acid (vitamin A), and represent approximately 10% of the liver cell population [31\u2022\u2022, 32]. LSECs have an important role in the maintenance of the quiescent state of HSCs [33,34]. In a healthy liver, tissue homeostasis is maintained by intracellular communication between HSCs, hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells, and LSECs, mainly via cytokines/chemokines.",

            "text": "The capillaries of the liver are contained within its sinusoids. Blood arrives here from two vascular systems, the arterial and portal vasculature (18). The endothelial cells in the sinusoids are discontinuous, with their primary function being filtration. They lack an organized basement membrane and function in partner with tissue resident macrophages, called Kupffer cells, to remove wastes, ECs doing so mainly through endocytosis (11,18). Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) represent a heterogenous population, with distinct phenotypes in different zones of the liver, as each zone is its own unique microenvironment (142). As the liver is a key immune organ, LSECs can present antigens to both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells via MHC Class I and II molecules [reviewed in (143,144)]. Interactions between LSECs and T cells can decrease T cell activation, preventing autoimmune dysfunction throughout the body. Traditional transmigration is not always necessary for immune cell surveillance. In some instances, T cells can pass through the LSEC gaps and directly contact hepatocytes, or contact hepatocytes without crossing the LSEC barrier by contacting the hepatocyte protrusions through the fenestrations (145). Leukocytes are recruited and infiltrate the liver sinusoids in several disease condition, including hepatitis and sepsis (29). While the liver has post-capillary venules, leukocyte migration primarily occurs in the sinusoidal capillaries and does not require selectins (29, 146). However, expression of E-selectin by a small percentage of LSECs was detected in Kupffer cell (resident liver macrophages)-depleted mice and serves to recruit monocytes that replenish the Kupffer cell population (147). Another unique aspect of liver sinusoidal TEM is that junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), rather than PECAM-1, is necessary for transmigration (148, 149). LSECs also express baseline levels of ICAM-1 and vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-",

The liver is a well-known tolerogenic organ, which is constantly exposed to a mass of harmless gut-derived bacterial or commensal antigens from the gastrointestinal tract (Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006;Thomson and Knolle, 2010). The maintenance of hepatic tolerance is mediated by a series of liver-resident antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells, Kupffer cells (KCs.), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) (Carambia et al., 2015;Doherty, 2016).\n\nMany nanoparticles were enriched in the liver after administration in vivo. Some of them were internalized by KCs, which play a vital role in antigen presentation and tolerance induction (Horst et al., 2016). As the liverresident macrophages, they phagocytose pathogens, deadcell debris, and other alien invaders, such as nanoparticles at about 500 nm in size range. Heymann demonstrated that KCs induced hepatic tolerance protected mice from kidney inflammation in T cell-mediated glomerulonephritis, mainly by mediating T cell arrest and Treg expansion (Heymann et al., 2015). LSECs are special microvascular endothelial cells that are the second type of scavenger cells in the liver. LSECs mainly phagocytose particles at about 200 nm in size range by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Sorensen et al., 2012), such as small particles and soluble macromolecules, which are mainly from circulation or processing by splenic cells (Thomson and Knolle, 2010;Carambia et al., 2015). LSECs can efficiently suppress inflammatory T cells response (Limmer et al",

These microparticles (100 nm\u2013100 \u00b5m) or nanoparticles (>100 nm) can transport complex cargos to other cells and, thus, provide communication and intercellular regulation. Various cells, such as hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) or hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), secrete and take up EVs in the healthy liver, and the amount, size and content of these vesicles are markedly altered under pathophysiological conditions. A comprehensive knowledge of the modified EV-related processes is very important, as they are of great value as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarize the latest knowledge on hepatic EVs and the role they play in the homeostatic processes in the healthy liver. In addition, we discuss the characteristic changes of EVs and their potential exacerbating or ameliorating effects in certain liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), drug induced liver injury (DILI), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), hepatocarcinoma (HCC) and viral hepatitis.",

In this context, the present study analyzed the relative cellular distribution pattern of silica NPs in the liver, and the effect of surface energy modification on NPs. Hydrophobic NP surface modification enhanced NP delivery to the liver and liver sinusoid fFendothelial cells (LSECs). Conversely, hydrophilic NP surface modification was commensurate with targeting hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) rather than other cell types. There was no notable difference in NP delivery to Kupffer cells or hepatocytes, regardless of hydrophilic or hydrophobic NP surface modification, suggesting that both the targeting of hepatocytes and evasion of phagocytosis by Kupffer cells are not associated with surface energy modification of silica NPs. This study provides useful information to target specific cell types using silica NPs, as well as to understand the relationship between NP surface energy and the NP distribution pattern in the liver, thereby helping to establish strategies for cell targeting using various NPs.",

In addition, we compared a ligand-dependent mRNA delivery efficiency of LNPs using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As shown in fig. S8, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid and galactose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. This phenomenon was previously reported among saccharideconjugated nanoparticles (41,42). The prepared mFLuc-loaded LNPs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Whole-body image showed substantial bioluminescence in the mice liver with mannose-incorporated LNPs and supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc. \n\nWe then examined the ability of LSEC-specific gene editing using mCre. mCre-loaded LNPs with mannose were injected to mice at a dose of mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 7A, ex vivo organ images also confirmed robust liver-specific tdTomato fluorescence. Next, cell type-specific fluorescence was quantified by imaging tissue sections. Notable tdTomato fluorescence was detected along the liver vessel (LSECs), and Kupffer cells rarely expressed tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. 7B). We further quantified this phenomenon by counting tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells with MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 7C, 15% of hepatocytes, 70% of LSECs, and 15% of Kupffer cells were tdTomato fluorescence positive. tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9D). Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.",

In geriatric population, the Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells (LSECs) become thicker 50% whereas the fenestrated diameter of sinusoidal endothelial vascular will decrease. 9 The reduction of fenestrated endothelium induces the deposit of lipoprotein-like chylomicroin in hepatocyte. This accumulation process leads to decrease the effectivity of waste disposal and induces the autoimmune disease which affect the interaction of T-lymphocytes and hepatocytes. 5 The degradation of LSECs waste disposal induces to dysregulation of LSECs to acute and chronic illness which enhance the risk of illness related to age, like diabetes mellitus, arteriosclerosis, arthritis, and neurodegenerative disease. 9,10 e Transformation of Stellata Hepatic and Kupffer Cell Stellata hepatic is a perisit cell in hepatocytes which functionate as the storage of vitamin A and lipid and also as the regulation of matrix extracellular metabolism. This perisit cell will induce the sinusoidal blood flow through contractile mechanism in stelata hepatic. In the animal study of primates and rats showed that there was an enhancement of lipid in stellata hepatic using the electonical microscope. 9,10 upffer cells are liver macrophage in sinusoidal lumen. Kupffer cells produce the inflammatory mediators like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 as the innate immune response. Not only does produce the inflammatory mediators, Kupffer cells also do a phagocytosis of macromolecules which are massive to be put in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. These had been proven in rats study that Kupffer cells in older rats showed the reduction of phagocytosis and autophagy and the enhancement of cytokine production which contributed to the inflammatory process in hepatocyte (inflammaging). 7,9",

            "text": "As illustrated in Figure 2, the TME in the liver has its unique components like liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), and hepatic satellite cells (HSCs), 23 which played an important role in the progression of liver metastasis. 74 Nonparenchymal components of liver sinusoids, like LSECs and HSCs, would assumptively interact with metastatic tumor cells. Therefore, it would be a feasible approach to target nonparenchymal cells in the liver TME for the treatment of liver metastasis. Systemic drug delivery to hepatocytes has successfully led to the approval of Onpattro by the FDA. However, the delivery to other functional nonparenchymal cells in the liver microenvironment remained challenging. Surprisingly, Paunovska et al 75 found that LNPs would be delivered more potently in stromal cells of the liver microenvironment compared to hepatocytes. These findings suggested the feasibility of targeting the liver microenvironment using drugloading liposomal nanoparticles. One of the major deficiencies of the liposomal drug was that it would be easily taken by the reticuloendothelial system, which diminished its circulating time and anti-tumor effect. However, as reticuloendothelial systems were important components of liver TME, 76 the increased uptake of TME-targeting LNPs would increase the concentrations of liposomal therapeutics in hepatic nonparenchymal cells, which led to better therapeutic effects.",

In hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver, Kupffer cells mainly took up NPs (38%), followed, equally, by HSCs (29%) and LSECs (29%), and then hepatocytes (4%). Interestingly, in hydrophobic-NP-PBS treated liver, LSECs were the main cells taking up NPs (41%), followed by Kupffer cells (36%), HSCs (21%), and hepatocytes (2%). The hydrophobic-NP-olive oil treated liver showed that the hierarchy of NP uptake decreased as follows: LSECs (39%) > Kupffer cells (32%) > HSCs (26%) > hepatocytes (3%). These trends prove that hydrophobic surface modification of NPs may be helpful to target LSECs, whereas hydrophilic surface modification of NPs may enhance their affinity to HSCs. Moreover, there was no notable change in NP uptake ratios between hepatocytes and Kupffer cells by the surface modification of silica NPs, indicating that targeting hepatocytes and evasion of phagocytosis by Kupffer cells are not associated with hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface modification of silica NPs.",

            "text": "LSECs plays an antiinflammatory role in the early development of NAFLD by reducing the secretion of proinflammatory chemokines. In NASH, impaired autophagy of LSECs enhance the expression of chemokines, cytokines and adhesion molecules, promote the development of liver inflammation, endothelial-tomesenchymal transition and liver fibrosis (53). After liver injury, LSECs rapidly lose their highly specialized phenotype and become capillarization, which impairs filtration and endocytosis of LSECs (54). Capillarization refers to the disappearance of the fenestrae and the formation of continuous basement membranes, which transforms LSECs into nonspecific endothelial cells. The accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in liver, which leads to progressive fibrosis. The main mechanism leading to liver fibrosis is a long-standing wound healing process (55), fibrogenesis is driven by dysfunctions of different kinds of sinusoidal cells, including stressed or injured hepatocytes, activated macrophages and HSCs (56). Due to the special position and role of LSECs in the hepatic sinusoids, LSECs can be regarded as the gatekeeper of the hepatic sinusoidal microenvironment, which may mediate the alterations of the hepatic sinusoid microenvironment. Capillarization of LSECs is a key step in the development of chronic liver disease, maintaining normal LSECs phenotype and function can inhibit the development of NASH to liver fibrosis. The intercellular communications among sinusoidal cells involves a series of complex mechanisms, here we review the crosstalk between LSECs and neutrophils, lymphocytes, HCs, KCs, and HSCs within hepatic sinusoids (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Obesity and insulin resistance can cause NAFLD, which is characterized by liver metabolic dysregulation, such as hyperlipidemia (95). Recent epidemiology of NAFLD and its connection with CVD suggest that blocking endothelial dysfunction would be beneficial (96), since endothelial function is impaired in patients with NAFLD (97).\n\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells are highly specialized ECs, which form the wall of liver sinusoids and represent up to 20% of liver cells (98). LSECs are well known for their crucial roles in liver regeneration (99)(100)(101) and chronic liver diseases associated with obesity (e.g., fibrosis) (102). LSECs maintain hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes in quiescence at basal condition but induce hepatocyte proliferation and angiogenesis during regeneration and undergo morphological and functional changes during fibrosis (103). It is believed that LSECs accomplish these by interacting with other hepatic cell types to maintain liver homeostasis. Since healthy LSECs facilitate the rapid transfer of fatty acids formed from cholesteryl esters to parenchymal cells, LSECs injury contributes to NAFLD (104). LSECs injury has been associated with NAFLD progression, where NAFLD may alter LSECs-mediated transport of nutrients, lipids, and lipoproteins. A recent study in choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, and high-fat diet models that mimic human NAFLD indicated that LSEC injury functions as \"gatekeeper\" in the progression from simple steatosis to the early non-alcoholic steatohepatitis stage, and LSEC injury may activate Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, which in turn results in chronic liver injuries (105). In this regard, LSECs operate as a traffic-director at the crossroad of regeneration and fibrosis (106). It is yet to be determined whether LSEC-derived factors are required for this function.",

            "text": "A feature of most types of particles, that is also shared by apoptotic cells, is their accumulation in the liver. The liver is the largest solid organ of the human body and it is generally regarded as a fundamental metabolic organ. However, the liver is also a core component of the immune system that has key relevance removing pathogens and exogenous antigens from the systemic circulation and promoting tolerance toward these agents (260)(261)(262). The liver is strategically positioned at a crossroad between the intestine and systemic circulation. It receives blood supply from the hepatic artery containing na\u00efve and memory lymphocytes and from the portal vein, which is rich in food and microbial antigens. These gut-derived constituents are efficiently cleared by cells of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system such as fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and DC, which also present them to passenger T cells in a tolerogenic context. Hepatic APC secrete abundant TGF-\u03b21 and IL-10, express PD-L1 and contribute to the differentiation of T reg cells (260)(261)(262). Thus, the liver immune system favors induction and maintenance of tolerance over immunity, avoiding immune responses to harmless foreign antigens form the diet and this function is believed to be largely mediated by LSECs (263)(264)(265)(266)(267)(268). Based on these observations, https://topas-therapeutics.com is developing a nanomedicine platform aiming to focus autoantigens to LSECs. This company generates super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) of about 10 nm diameter that are conjugated with up to 100 autoantigen peptides (269). The small size of these particles is a feature for LSEC targeting. LSECs display poor phagocytic capabilities and preferentially take up soluble macromolecules and small particles (270). Electron microscopy of liver sections from mice treated with SPIONs have been shown how these nanoparticles localize into the endosomal compartment of LSECs (269).",

            "text": "Clodronate and gadolinium chloride have no effect on liver sinusoidal epithelial cell uptake and may be more beneficial to inhibiting liver sequestration of larger nanomaterials. While attractive, these transient depletion strategies are not well-characterized for their safety, and studies investigating dose-efficacy relationships and concurrent effect on innate immunity are rare [23]. \n\nAnother research group proposed the use of intralipid 20%, an FDA-approved fat emulsion used for parenteral nutrition to temporarily blunt the phagocytic capacity of Kupffer cells by decreasing the accumulation of nanoparticles in the liver and spleen, thus increasing the bioavailability of nanodrugs via the EPR effect [90]. This strategy stems from a report that infusion of Intralipid 20% impedes Kupffer cell function by inhibiting peritoneal clearance, hence impairing their phagocytic activity [91]. Their data showed that in rodents, intralipid reduced Kupffer cell uptake by approximately 50%, leading to an increase in the blood half-life of nano-and micron-sized super paramagnetic iron-oxide particles by ~three-fold. They also demonstrated that a single clinical dose (2 g/kg) of intralipid 20% could decrease the accumulation of platinum nanoparticles in the liver by 20.4%, in the spleen by 42.5%, and in the kidney by 39.3% after 24 h post nanodrug administration. Subsequently, the bioavailability of the platinum-nanodrug increased by 18.7% during the first 5 h and by 9.4% after 24 h, respectively. \n\nMost strategies aimed at silencing the impact of the RES have focused solely on Kupffer cells. Earlier, it had been established that small-sized nanoparticles are more likely to be trapped within the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), which could affect the overall bioavailability of these particles. The major receptors involved in the sequestering action of liver sinusoidal epithelial cells include mannose, Fc\u03b3, collagen-alpha receptor, and the hyaluronan scavenger receptors [27].",

Two hours after injection, the liver tissue were collected and signal cells were prepared. F4/80 antibody and cytokeratin-18 antibody were used to label Kupffer macrophages and hepatocytes, respectively, and FACS was then conducted. The data indicated that 74.7% of Kupffer macrophages and 31.2% of hepatocytes internalized (Supplementary Fig. S9). This result suggests that most Kupffer macrophages uptake iLAND. While Kupffer macrophage only accounted for a small part of liver cells, and the vast majority of liver cells are hepatocytes (higher than 60%) 41,42 , the total amount of iLAND positive cells in hepatocytes is much greater than that of Kupffer cells. \n\nConfocal micrographs of liver cryosections prepared from mice receiving the treatments of Cy5-NA@iLAND, Cy5-NA@MC3 or Cy5-NA@SM-102 were carefully analyzed. Here the livers were harvested 2 h after injection, followed by fixing, cryosectioning, and counterstaining with DAPI and FITC-labeled phalloidin to visualize the nuclei (blue) and rough cell outlines (green), respectively. Actually, the hepatocytes are regular in shape and large in diameter, while the nonparenchymal cells are irregular in shape and small in size. As shown in Fig. 3G, asterisks mark representative hepatocytes, and arrows indicate representative nonparenchymal cells (including Kupffer macrophages and hepatic stellate cells, etc.). We observed preferential accumulation of Cy5-NA@MC3 and Cy5-NA@iLAND in hepatocytes, with minimal association with nonparenchymal cells in liver sinusoids. Notably, a large amount of Cy5-NA@SM-102 was endocytosed by nonparenchymal cells.",

The findings from these studies supported the supposition that systemic injection is the best administration route but that targeting sites beyond the liver faces challenges. The liver tropism of lipid nanovehicles is mainly attributed to the following reasons: 1) the blood flow rate through the liver is high, accounting for 27% of cardiac output; 2) sinusoidal membranes in the liver are extensively fenestrated; 3) Kupffer cells, liver-specific macrophages, are responsible for clearing most nanoparticles; and 4) liver endothelial cells present efficient uptake activity 60 . In addition to traditional active and passive targeting tactics, innovative strategies have been developed to achieve targeting sites outside the liver (e.g., targeting the spleen, lung, and tumors), including targeting by adjusting the lipid constituents and physicochemical properties of the lipid nanovehicles and biomimetic decoration.",

            "text": "These EVs enhance the recruitment of proinflammatory monocytes into the liver and their adhesion to the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) [8][9][10]. \n\nLSEC are highly specialized endothelial cells, arranged as a discontinuous layer to form the vascular bed of the liver sinusoids and separate passenger leukocytes in the sinusoidal lumen from hepatocytes [11]. A histological section of a mouse liver depicting the positional relationship between LSEC and hepatocytes is shown in Figure 1. LSEC uniquely differentiate from other endothelial cells in the body by the lack of basement membrane and the presence of LSEC fenestrae. Fenestrae are 50-200 nm diameter pores covering 2-20% of the endothelial surface. Fenestrae are organized in clusters termed sieve plates that can be altered in response to different stimuli. These features enhance the endocytic capacity of the LSEC and facilitate the elimination of a variety of macromolecules, including lipids and lipoproteins, from the circulation by receptor-mediated endocytosis, making LSEC highly specialized scavenger cells [12]. Moreover, LSEC play a key role in the inflammatory response; they produce chemokines in response to various insults and serve as a platform for various immune cells to lodge in the liver. Therefore, specialized natural killer cells, lymphocytes, and myeloid cells adhere to the surface of LSEC to achieve residence in the liver [11]. LSEC play an anti-inflammatory role early on during NAFLD development by decreasing pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion [13].",

            "text": "The liver is the largest internal organ in the human body and plays important roles in many vital metabolic and secretory processes. Most liver-specific functions, such as lipid metabolism, plasma protein synthesis and detoxification are mainly performed by parenchymal hepatocytes, 1 whose functionality depends on a complex interplay with different non-parenchymal cells (NPCs). Hepatocytes are arranged in cords between small capillaries known as sinusoids, lined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC). These are specialized liver endothelial cells (LECs) that facilitate direct contact between blood and hepatocytes through numerous fenestrations, and show high endocytic capacity. 2 The sinusoids also contain liver-resident macrophages called Kupffer cells (KC), which comprise as much as 80%-90% of the total macrophage population in the body. 3 The perisinusoidal space of Disse contains hepatic stellate cells (HSC) which store lipids and vitamin A, and help maintain extracellular matrix homoeostasis. 4 Together, these four cell types constitute lobules, the structural units of the liver microarchitecture. Hepatocytes represent 60% of the total liver cell population, and around 80% of liver volume, while most of the remaining population consists of LSEC, KC and HSC (and 6.5% of the liver volume, the remainder being vasculature and cholangiocyte-lined bile ducts). 5 vances in transcriptomics and proteomics have enabled system-wide investigations of gene and protein expression in human cells and tissues, including the liver. 6 Recently, laser-capture microdissection has also allowed the study of regional differences in gene expression throughout the liver microarchitecture. 7 However, since parenchymal cells constitute such a large proportion of the liver, whole-tissue studies mainly reflect hepatocyte expression.",

Wilklander et al. found that regardless of dose, time duration, route of injection, or tissue source, EVs tend to accumulate predominantly in the liver [40]. Moreover, EVs resemble liposomes in terms of size, shape, and structure but have more complex bilayers. In line with earlier findings on the biodistribution of synthetic liposomes, the accumulation of nanoparticles in the liver may be attributed to taken up by patrolling macrophages, for example, by Kupffer cells in liver [41]. Nevertheless, several nanoparticle studies have revealed that particle size affects the distribution and clearance of nanoparticles. As an example, small liposomes (\u2264 100 nm) are less prone to opsonization and penetrate the fenestrations in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (about 150 nm) [42][43][44]. \n\nIn line with earlier findings on the biodistribution of synthetic liposomes, our results showed the circulating EVs size distribution was 101.8 \u00b1 28.2 nm. Most of EVs could penetrate these fenestrations, thus increasing the hepatocyte uptake of the total accumulation of EVs. Considering the fluorescent labeling of EVs, the physiology of the liver, and the structural characteristics of EVs, this information supports the notion that hepatocytes can uptake circulating EVs.",

            "text": "In vitro internalization in primary cultures of LSECs of the three FPM formulations with the specific ligands for CD32b, CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 receptors demonstrated that specific ligand-receptor interactions plus passive targeting promoted uptake by a greater number of healthy LSECs than the micelles conjugated with their scrambled variants. \n\nSimvastatin has been shown to reduce portal hypertension through the putative reduction in IHVR by means of several mechanisms, including the induction of KLF2 expression, related to the stimulation of a vasoprotective phenotype in LSECs [11,12,33]. This effect was confirmed by the expected overexpression of KLF2 in healthy isolated LSECs treated with free or encapsulated simvastatin. We also ruled out any possible effect of the empty functionalized nanodevices acting only as an inert vehicle for the delivery of the loaded drug. \n\nIntravenous treatment of healthy rats with the different fluorescent formulations confirms that, in all cases, functionalization confers greater efficiency in entering the main liver cells than passive targeting; the capture of FPMs was clearly superior to that achieved by non-functionalized PMs, and LSECs were the liver cells with the highest uptake. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, all three types of functionalization were equally effective. In vivo cell internalization experiments also confirmed that the receptors selected as LSEC targets for our nanoparticles were also expressed in healthy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, allowing functionalized nanoparticles to enter both cell types quite efficiently. This was expected for CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 , as their expression in the liver is elevated not only in LSECs, but also in other hepatic cell types [34,35]. However, CD32b, an Fc\u03b3R conferring LSECs the highest endocytic capacity of any cell in the human body, is known to be the most specific marker of these cells in the liver. Yet, recent studies have shown that CD32b is not only expressed in LSECs but also in Kupffer cells, with a liver level expression of 90% and 10%, respectively [36].",

Contrary to the hydrophobic NP-treated liver, the hierarchy of relative NP uptake ratio by each cell type in the hydrophilic NP-treated liver was Kupffer cells > HSCs \u2245 LSECs > hepatocytes (Figure 8A). Moreover, the ratio of NP-positive LSECs was significantly lower in hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver relative to that in hydrophobic NP-treated liver (Figure 4B,C). The fact that hydrophobic silica NPs have a high affinity for LSECs, whereas hydrophilic surface-modified NPs have a low affinity for LSECs means that hydrophobic surface modification of silica NPs can be a pivotal factor in targeting LSECs, specifically in the liver.

[5,10,[12][13][14][15] However, expanding the scope of LNP-based gene therapies to other hepatic cell types (or nonhepatic cells), and therefore gain access to many tissue-/cell-specific diseases, has so far proven more challenging. To meet this challenge, empirical screening of LNPs has revealed formulations that preferentially target extrahepatic tissues (e.g., bone marrow) [16,17] and cells (e.g., T-cells), [18,19] as well as individual hepatic (e.g., liver endothelial) cell types. [20,21] However, while these empirical discoveries have enriched our understanding of the structure-activity land-scape of LNP technologies, they have not revealed the biological mechanisms underpinning LNP transport and preferential cellular uptake in vivo. This knowledge is fundamental for rational design and should be the foundation of any future discovery efforts toward LNP-RNA therapies with target cell specificity beyond hepatocytes. [5,22] Besides hepatocytes (comprising \u224880% liver volume), the liver is composed of nonparenchymal liver cells, including Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). [23] Hepatic blood vessels, or sinusoids, connecting the hepatic artery and portal vein to the central vein, are primarily composed of LSECs (\u224870%) and KCs (\u224820%). [24,25] Together, these two cell types make up the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) whose primary role is to maintain blood homeostasis through the scavenging of macromolecular waste and pathogens from blood. [26,27] LSECs, in particular, are specialized scavenger endothelial cells (SECs) and have one of the highest endocytic activities of any cell type in the body.

Here, we present an optimized clinical-stage nanoparticle-based approach that specifically targets liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). \n\nThe liver is widely recognized for its remarkable ability to tolerize foreign antigens, a necessity considering its constant exposure to antigens from the diet or gut microbiome (12). While various non-parenchymal liver cells (NPLCs) exhibit tolerogenic capacities, LSECs outnumber Kupffer cells by approximately 2.5 times and excel in promoting tolerance even under inflammatory conditions (12). \n\nDelivering disease-relevant peptides to LSECs by an early version of our nanoparticles significantly suppressed autoimmune pathology in relevant animal models (13). For clinical use, we subsequently optimized our particles with a new coating polymer to improve biodegradability and manufacturability. This updated version showed potent tolerizing effects on antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in mice (14). To warrant a broad range of clinical applications, we further refined the formulation and peptide carrier functions of these nanoparticles, now called \"Topas Particle Conjugates\" (TPCs). Here, we present the results of this optimization process using a proprietary linker technology for diverse peptide conjugation, confirming that the updated TPCs preferentially target LSECs and effectively induce peptide-specific T cell tolerance in clinically relevant CD4 + T cell-mediated disease models. Due to their unique physicochemical properties, TPCs provide a versatile platform for delivering diverse antigenic peptides to highly tolerogenic LSECs, leveraging the precision of nanomedicine to induce antigen-specific tolerance in ADs.",

Non-parenchymal liver cells (NPCs), largely comprising macrophages, dendritic cells, hepatic stellate cells and liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs), serve to induce immunological tolerance. Therefore, the liver is an important target for therapeutic approaches, in case of both (inflammatory) metabolic diseases and immunological disorders. This review aims to summarize current preclinical nanodrug-based approaches for the treatment of liver disorders. So far, nano-vaccines that aim to induce hepatitis virus-specific immune responses and nanoformulated adjuvants to overcome the default tolerogenic state of liver NPCs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis have been tested. Moreover, liver cancer may be treated using nanodrugs which specifically target and kill tumor cells. Alternatively, nanodrugs may target and reprogram or deplete immunosuppressive cells of the tumor microenvironment, such as tumor-associated macrophages. Here, combination therapies have been demonstrated to yield synergistic effects. In the case of autoimmune hepatitis and other inflammatory liver diseases, anti-inflammatory agents can be encapsulated into nanoparticles to dampen inflammatory processes specifically in the liver. Finally, the tolerance-promoting activity especially of LSECs has been exploited to induce antigen-specific tolerance for the treatment of allergic and autoimmune diseases.",

Data regarding the biodistribution of polymers, polymer lipids, and lipid nanoparticles indicate that the internal and external nanoparticle charges are one of the most influential factors for selective organ and tissue tropism of nanostructured LNPs [149][150][151][152][153].

The ever-increasing manufacture and utilisation of NMs enhances the need to assess the potential hazard and safety concerns to those encountering these materials [3][4][5].\n\nThe liver has been identified as an extremely important organ for the accumulation and potentially the clearance of NMs from the bloodstream [6][7][8][9][10]. In addition to occupational and consumer exposure via inhalation and ingestion, recent advances in the field of nanomedicine mean that direct entry of NMs into the bloodstream is a very real prospect [1][2][3][4][5][6].\n\nThe liver is the bodies' principal detoxification centre, removing foreign substances and waste products i.e. bilirubin [11]. The organ is characterised by its distinct populations of cells, amongst which the hepatocytes (parenchymal cells), the resident macrophage population (Kupffer cells -KCs) and sinusoidal endothelial cells are amongst some of the most important [12][13][14]. In particular and of great importance in particle hepatotoxicity is the fact that the KCs line the liver sinusoids. This locality means that these cells have constant contact with any materials or organisms, which reach the organ via the bloodstream (including from the gastrointestinal tract). Additionally, once activated KCs are the most important cell populations in the modulation and governance of overall hepatic immune response in the non-diseased organ [14,15]. However, the KCs are not likely to be 100% effective at prevention of the hepatocytes encountering materials as very small NMs could access the parenchymal cells via the open fenestrations in the liver sinusoids. In a recent study in which mice were dosed by intravenous injection or intratracheal injection, both CeO 2 and TiO 2 NM aggregates were identified in the sinusoids and often in the KCs up to 180 days",

            "text": "However, the endocytic capacity of galactose-terminated glycoproteins is much lower in LSECs than in hepatocytes or Kupffer cells (Magnu \u00b4sson & Berg, 1993). Thus, galactose-modified delivery systems are suitable for targeting hepatocytes (Morimoto et al., 2003;Popielarski et al., 2005) and Kupffer cells via galactose particle/fucose receptors (Dong et al., 2008). In fact, several delivery systems have been synthesized to deliver therapeutic molecules into Kupffer cells, including galactosylated lowmolecular-weight chitosan (Dong et al., 2009). Shimada et al. (1997) also reported that biodegradable PEG-conjugated galactolipids show greater targeting (490%) for Kupffer cells when intravenously injected into rats. Thus, several galactose-modified delivery systems show greater transfection efficiency in the liver than in other organs (e.g. lung, kidney, heart and spleen) (Hisayasu et al., 1999;Nishikawa et al., 2000). However, these results do not mean greater transfection efficiency for hepatocytes than other hepatic cells. \n\nThe uptake of galactose-modified nanoparticles by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells is influenced by the sizes of these nanoparticles. For example, slightly anionic, galactose-PEGylated nanoparticles of 50 nm in diameter efficiently target hepatocytes, but nanoparticles of 140 nm in diameter are more selective for Kupffer cells (Popielarski et al., 2005). Moreover, when galactosylated low-molecular-weight chitosan/oligodeoxynucleotide complexes of 150 nm in diameter were intravenously injected into mice, Kupffer cells (50.6%) and LSECs (33.2%) endocytosed 483% of the complexed molecules, whereas hepatocytes endocytosed only 16.2% of the complexed molecules (Dong et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Liver sinusoids are lined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), which represent approximately 15 to 20% of the liver cells, but only 3% of the total liver volume. LSEC have unique functions, such as fluid filtration, blood vessel tone modulation, blood clotting, inflammatory cell recruitment, and metabolite and hormone trafficking. Different subtypes of liver endothelial cells are also known to control liver zonation and hepatocyte function. Here, we have reviewed the origin of LSEC, the different subtypes identified in the liver, as well as their renewal during homeostasis. The liver has the exceptional ability to regenerate from small remnants. The past decades have seen increasing awareness in the role of non-parenchymal cells in liver regeneration despite not being the most represented population. While a lot of knowledge has emerged, clarification is needed regarding the role of LSEC in sensing shear stress and on their participation in the inductive phase of regeneration by priming the hepatocytes and delivering mitogenic factors. It is also unclear if bone marrow-derived LSEC participate in the proliferative phase of liver regeneration. Similarly, data are scarce as to LSEC having a role in the termination phase of the regeneration process. Here, we review what is known about the interaction between LSEC and other liver cells during the different phases of liver regeneration. We next explain extended hepatectomy and small liver transplantation, which lead to \u201csmall for size syndrome\u201d (SFSS), a lethal liver failure. SFSS is linked to endothelial denudation, necrosis, and lobular disturbance. Using the knowledge learned from partial hepatectomy studies on LSEC, we expose several techniques that are, or could be, used to avoid the \u201csmall for size syndrome\u201d after extended hepatectomy or small liver transplantation.",

After intravenous injection of a liver cell-targeted delivery system (nanoparticles) containing a therapeutic molecule, the nanoparticle binds to plasma proteins, particularly albumin. Plasma protein binding reduces liver-specific uptake of the nanoparticle delivery system. Nanoparticles can be delivered to hepatocytes through receptormediated endocytosis, into Kupffer cells by phagocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis, into stellate cells by receptormediated endocytosis and into LSECs by pinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Of these endocytic routes, receptormediated endocytosis is the most commonly used method to deliver nanoparticles into the targeted liver cells. Most of the nanoparticles are taken up and removed by Kupffer cells and LSECs because they express a variety of receptors that limit the number of nanoparticles capable of reaching the hepatocytes and stellate cells. \n\nefficiency in vitro, their transfection efficiency is much lower in vivo because of the high endocytic capacity of Kupffer and LSECs. \n\nTo facilitate the selective transfer of therapeutic molecules into hepatocytes, the delivery system should have a small diameter to allow the delivery system to pass through the sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae (Rensen et al., 2001), which are 100 nm in diameter (Wisse et al., 1985). After passing through the fenestrae, the delivery systems can be internalized in hepatocytes. \n\nAsialoglycoprotein receptor-mediated delivery.

In addition to small size and susceptibility to modifications, nanoparticles can passively target solid tumors due to their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. 107,108 The abnormalities of tumor vasculature and hypervascularization can be attributed to changes in vascular architecture and extensive production of vascular permeability factors, which stimulate extravasation within the tumor tissues, lacking lymphatic drainage. 107 Notably, the median efficiency of injected nanoparticles delivery was reported to be only 0.7% across 117 studies between 2006 and 2016, despite recent advances in nanotechnology. 109,110,111 Most administered nanoparticles do not reach their targeted tissues or organs due to their accumulation and sequestration in the liver and spleen (if >6 nm) or elimination through the kidney (if <6 nm). 112 Mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) in liver and spleen recognize nanoparticles as foreign substances. 113 Therefore, to increase the delivery efficiency, it is necessary to prevent blood clearance of nanoparticles by liver, spleen, or kidney, allowing accumulation in the target tissues. 113 After nanoparticles enter the liver, they transverse through the hepatic sinusoid and then may be sequestered by the Kupffer cells, the tissue resident macrophages in liver sinusoids. 112 Kupffer cells are important for the targeting efficiency of nanoparticles; they phagocytose and destroy foreign materials and pathogens in blood, and are involved in erythrocytes recycling. Kupffer cells function as the first layer of innate immunity and the surface charge, ligand chemistry, and size of nanoparticles severely affect the uptake and the retention of nanoparticles. 112 Hence, in order to reach to the targeted organ, many applications were developed to block the interaction and the removal of nanoparticles by Kupffer cells (Table 1). 112 Once the nanoparticles transcytose through the hepatocytes, nanoparticles may travel through hepatic ducts, accumulate inside the gallbladder, or enter into the common bile duct, and then are ex",

            "text": "The liver has a unique role in lipid metabolism as it represents a site for lipid uptake, synthesis, oxidation, and distribution of lipids to peripheral tissues. The cell population in the liver includes parenchymal cells (hepatocytes ~78% of the liver's total cell population) [14]. Non-parenchymal cells include liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and hepatic NK cells [14,15]. While hepatocytes have been associated with the liver's primary function, such as lipid metabolism, KCs play a key role in liver inflammation [14,15]. KCs are resident macrophages that account for about 30% of sinusoidal cells [16] and 80% to 90% of macrophages in the human body [17,18]. Upon liver injury, KCs are activated to release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines contributing to the pathogenesis of NAFLD [18]. Liver inflammation is regulated by the balance between proinflammatory M1 KCs and anti-inflammatory M2 KCs [19]. The liver is exposed to various substances, such as nutrients and gut-derived bacterial products, via the portal circulation, which are eliminated by KCs [20]. KCs produce various inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and chemokines [18]. HSCs are at rest under normal circumstances; however, in response to inflammation and hepatocyte damage caused by lipotoxicity, they become activated and transform into myofibroblastlike cells, secreting increased collagen and causing fibrosis [21,22]. Little is known about the contribution of LSEC lipotoxcity to the progression of NAFLD. Lipotoxicity of LSEC may lead to decreases in both nitric oxide and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, resulting in oxidative stress and NASH [23].",

            "text": "Finally, we analyzed the relative ratio of NP uptake based on each cell type and based on the surface modification condition of the silica NPs. In hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver, Kupffer cells mainly took up NPs (38%), followed, equally, by HSCs (29%) and LSECs (29%), and then hepatocytes (4%). Interestingly, in hydrophobic-NP-PBS treated liver, LSECs were the main cells taking up NPs (41%), followed by Kupffer cells (36%), HSCs (21%), and hepatocytes (2%). The hydrophobic-NP-olive oil treated liver showed that the hierarchy of NP uptake decreased as follows: LSECs (39%) > Kupffer cells (32%) > HSCs (26%) > hepatocytes (3%). These trends prove that hydrophobic surface modification of NPs may be helpful to target LSECs, whereas hydrophilic surface modification of NPs may enhance their affinity to HSCs. Moreover, there was no notable change in NP uptake ratios between hepatocytes and Kupffer cells by the surface modification of silica NPs, indicating that targeting hepatocytes and evasion of phagocytosis by Kupffer cells are not associated with hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface modification of silica NPs. livers (Figure 6A). The numbers of NP-positive hepatocytes were almost the same, without any significant difference among all types of NP-treated livers (Figure 6B).

Namely, the ratio of NP-positive hepatocytes was less than 4% in all types of NP-treated liver regardless of NP surface modification and the solvent used to disperse NPs.",

Apart from the one noteworthy example of i.v. administered oligonucleotide therapeutics patisiran that successfully targets the major type of liver cells, the hepatocytes (HCs) [2], the general rule is that large molecules/nanoformulations are rapidly cleared from the circulation by specialized scavenger cells lining the wall of the several hundred million capillary-like liver vessels called liver sinusoids. The scavenger cells of the liver sinusoids represent two cell types: the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the Kupffer cells (KCs). The KCs are the resident mononuclear phagocytes of the liver and represent by far the largest population of macrophages in the body. These cells are geared to carry out phagocytosis of large blood-borne material (>200 nm). In contrast the LSECs, representing the great majority of endothelial cells of the liver, are unable to perform phagocytosis under normal conditions, but are among the most active endocytic cells of the body, using clathrin-mediated endocytosis and a set of unique endocytosis receptors [3]. \n\nAlthough the LSECs and KCs make up only 3.3% and 2.5% of the total liver volume, the numberwise distribution of same cells is 21% and 8.5% [4].",

            "text": "The selectivity of the YSK05/12-LNP for the liver endothelium over the lung or spleen endothelium can be attributed to the special scavenging character of LSECs, which have a very high endocytic capacity and are responsible for the uptake of soluble or colloidal materials and nanoparticles that are not large enough to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. 16,17,20,46,47 It is noteworthy that, despite the improved activity in LSECs, the YSK05-LNP was still stronger in hepatocytes than the YSK05/12-LNP in LSECs. This can be attributed to the difference in the type of siRNA used to target hepatocytes or LSECs (siFVII vs siCD31, respectively), which might have different gene silencing strengths. Furthermore, differences in cellular properties between hepatocytes and LSECs should also be considered. Another possible explanation is related to the low uptake of YSK05/12-LNP by Kupffer cells due to its cationic charge. However, this uptake is small compared with that of YSK12-C4-LNP (pKa 8.00), which could be taken up by Kupffer cells due to its highly cationic charge, and despite its strong activity in vitro, 36 it lost its activity completely in vivo. Moreover, the weak activity of the YSK12-C4-LNP could be attributed to its rapid disintegration in the blood stream and the leakage of siRNA. As shown in Figure S2, the siRNA was rapidly eliminated and detected in the kidney at 30 minutes after intravenous administration, possibly due to the high cationic charge of the LNP and its recognition by the reticuloendothelial system, while the lipids derived from LNPs were mostly distributed to lungs and, to a lower extent, the liver.",

            "text": "A further way of overcoming the issues detailed above with regard to the composition of conventional 2D liver cultures is by forming cultures comprising multiple liver cell types. The liver is an extremely diverse organ, with varied cellular composition containing not only hepatocytes, but also many non-parenchymal cell types (comprising the 20% of the total liver mass) in the form of Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells, fibroblasts, biliary epithelial cells, immune cells, and adult stem cells [21], all of which play critical roles in the liver. Proper liver function is highly dependent on the interactions between these varying cell types and hepatocytes; therefore, by incorporating multiple cell types in a 2D culture, it is possible to produce a more physiologically relevant model with tissue characteristics and increased liver functionality [80,81]. Recently, many co-culture cell systems have been developed. For example, hepatocyte/macrophage co-cultures have been successfully used to model acute responses to septic liver injury and liver regeneration [18, 23,82]. Culturing hepatocytes with LSECs, in the presence or absence of collagen, allows LSECs to maintain their phenotype and hepatocytes to increase their in vivo-like function also enhanced (e.g., CYP activity) [83]. Similarly, when HepG2 cells are co-cultured with LSECs [84], CYP enzyme induction is enhanced, suggesting that the introduction of endothelial cells influences hepatocyte function in vitro (46). Furthermore, in addition to LSECs enhancing hepatocyte function, similarly hepatocytes support LSEC function [83], influencing LSECs ability to control important repair mechanisms in the liver following injury [85]. Kupffer cell/ hepatocyte co-cultures have also been reported, exhibiting responses to a variety of inflammatory stimuli not observed in monocultures [86]. Metabolic functions are also dramatically increased when KCs are cultured with hepatocytes, as demonstrated by Yagi et al. [87]. Various other immune cells have also been co-cultured with",

Moreover, AMD3100 treatment reduced the CD4+ T cell number and abolished the chemotactic effect of CXCL12 on CD4+ T cells in a NASH mouse model, indicating that CXCR4 can represent a potential therapeutic target for NASH treatment [110]. On the contrary, a gavage treatment of fibrotic mice with AMD070, another CXCR4 inhibitor, exerted a negligible effect on the liver fibrosis markers [185]. \n\nThe treatment of primary LSECs isolated from mice with PA induced the expression of NOX-1, while this induction was repressed after the incubation of cells with TAK-242 (TLR4-inhibitor) [80]. Of note, NOX-1 induces liver fibrosis through the regulation of hepatocyte proliferation and ROS generation [80,186]. \n\nCurrently, nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery methods have attracted tremendous attention as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of NAFLD. NPs represent an opportunity to achieve sophisticated targeting therapy due to their size and surface characteristics and their ability to protect drug degradation and control the drug cellular uptake at the desired tissues, such as the liver [187]. Due to the lack of basal lamina and the size of liver sinusoidal fenestrae (50-200 nm), LSECs provide a mesh-like structure, contributing to the entrapment of NPs in the liver. This structure facilitates the accumulation of high concentrations of NPs in the Disse space and their distribution to other liver cells [188]. \n\nAfter systemic administration, NPs with a size greater than 6 nm accumulate in the liver. Therefore, enterohepatic microcirculation plays a crucial role in delivering orally administered NPs to the liver [189]. Recently, an apolipoprotein B (ApoB) sequence has been used to decorate nanoparticles, given that ApoB is a ligand for both scavenger receptors, stabilin-1 and 2, expressed by LSECs [138].",

The RES consists broadly of Kupffer cells of the liver, microglia of the brain, alveolar macrophages, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and macrophages of the intestine and other tissues [79]. Typically, less than 5% of an injected dose of nanoparticles is delivered to the cancer tissue, resulting in an extremely low drug delivery efficiency and, consequently, a poor therapeutic outcome [80]. Elimination of the bulk of nanoparticles occurs via the RES organs of the liver and spleen [81]. The injection of large amounts of drug-loaded nanoparticles to compensate for this loss raises toxicity concerns with respect to decreased RES function and the risk of nonspecific drug release [80]. Therefore, reducing the uptake of nanoparticles by the RES is a strategic approach to enhance the magnitude of the EPR effect that could lead to high accumulation of macromolecules at the site of action. \n\nProminent among the RES apparatus are the Kupffer cells positioned in liver sinusoids as part of the body's innate immunity [82]. They are specialized macrophages formed from liver adhering circulating monocytes that polarize into cells with highly differentiated surface receptors which facilitate the binding and/or uptake of foreign materials [27]. The extent of nanoparticle uptake and retention in Kupffer cells is strongly associated with the nanoparticle's surface charge, ligand chemistry, and size, with particles of highly cationic and anionic surface charge being cleared faster than those with neutral charge [83]. Similarly, large nanoparticles are more likely to be sequestered and destroyed by the Kupffer cells [20]. The fate of nanoparticles is further complicated by the fact that smaller monodispersed nanomaterials may be taken up by liver sinusoidal epithelial cells (LSECs) to a higher degree [27].",

            "text": "In the human body, the liver is the major organ for detoxification. It has the ability to deoxidize, bile formation, protein synthesis, store glycogen, and general homeostasis. By isolating and removing various foreign exogenous compounds via phagocytosis, the liver functions as a biological barrier (Yao et al. 2019;Boey and Boey 2020). The liver is a complex network of interconnected cells. The basic functioning unit of the liver is the hepatocyte; the hepatic lobule constitutes about 60% of the hepatocytes (solid cells) and 30-35% of the Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, liver sinusoidal, and endothelial cells (non-solid cells). The liver's normal physiological and biochemical functions can be affected by nanoparticles deposited in liver tissue, affecting liver cells and important physiological processes (Yao et al. 2019). \n\nThe histological photographs of the liver of albino female rats in the control group show that the central vein and hepatic cords were normally arranged, as in Fig. 4A. Also, Fig. 4B shows that the hepatic lobules, the hepatocytes, the sinusoids, and the Kupffer cells were also normal. Figures 5,  6, 7 and 8 show pathological changes in the liver of female rats due to accumulated CuO/ZnO core/shell NPs in the liver at various doses compared with the control group Fig. 4A. \n\nThe tissue of rats treated with a 5 (mg/L) dose of CuO/ ZnO core/shell NPs appear in Fig. 5A. The central vein and hepatic cords are regularly arranged. Figure 5B shows the magnified sections of hepatic lobules and hepatic cords and revealed mild micro vacultion within cytoplasmic hepatocytes and little formation of stellate cells. The group treated with a 10 (mg/L) dose showed disarrangement of hepatic cords with vacular degeneration, as shown in Fig. 6A.",

            "text": "In order to perform the various functions of a liver, such as biotransformation, coagulation factor production, and lipid homeostasis, the organ harbors various cell types. The most abundant cells in the liver are the hepatocytes, accounting for approximately 60-70% of all liver cells, whereas other cell types are less abundant, e.g., HSCs (vitamin A storage, 5-15%) [17], Kupffer cells (liver macrophages, 10-15%) [18], cholangiocytes (bile duct cells, 3-5%) [19], and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (blood vessel lining, 15-20%) [20]. In a healthy liver, hepatocytes store limited amounts of neutral lipids in LDs. In contrast, HSCs contain large LDs, responsible for the storage of most of the vitamin A in the body [17,21]. When livers accumulate excessive amounts of lipids within hepatocytes, liver function is hindered. Paradoxically, in response to hepatocyte lipid accumulation, HSCs lose their large vitamin A-laden LDs and \"transactivate\" into an extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing phenotype, a hallmark of liver fibrosis [17,21]. Therefore, strategies to keep HSCs in an LD-rich state and at the same time lower LDs in hepatocytes are likely to be instrumental in the prevention or reversal of liver fibrosis. This approach might, however, also negatively affect the lipogenic state of HSCs. This \"fat\" paradox (Figure 1) [22] often complicates the effective treatment of liver disease. To provide some leads, we will present an overview of lipid metabolism and LD dynamics in the liver, followed by a description of the key players in lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and HSCs. We end with discussing recent promising models to better study the mechanisms of liver disease and screen for potential therapeutic drugs in vitro.",

They lack a basement membrane and display open channels (fenestrae), making them exceptionally permeable. LSEC are the first cells affected by any kind of liver injury orchestrating the liver response to damage. LSEC govern the regenerative process initiation, but aberrant LSEC activation in chronic liver injury induces fibrosis. LSEC are also main players in fibrosis resolution. They maintain liver homeostasis and keep hepatic stellate cell and Kupffer cell quiescence. After sustained hepatic injury, they lose their phenotype and protective properties, promoting angiogenesis and vasoconstriction and contributing to inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, improving LSEC phenotype is a promising strategy to prevent liver injury progression and complications. This review focuses on changes occurring in LSEC after liver injury and their consequences on fibrosis progression, liver regeneration, and resolution. Finally, a synopsis of the available strategies for LSEC-specific targeting is provided.",

Liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs) are fenestrated cells that exist in close vicinity to hepatocytes, macrophages and HSCs, which, under physiological conditions, regulate lipid transport, maintain the quiescence of Kupffer cells, resident liver macrophages, and HSCs [64]. At early stage of NAFLD, LSECs lose their fenestrae, a process termed capillarization, which could favor liver steatosis and initiate HSCs activation [64] (Fig. 3). During NASH, LSECs display a pro-inflammatory phenotype that promotes steatohepatitis [64].",

Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23",

            "text": "Furthermore, the tumor cells cannot divide and proliferate, leading to apoptosis (Qin et al., 2010;Shi et al., 2014). Certainly, negative surface charge for lipid nanoparticles can cause lower cytotoxicity than cationic surface charge for nanoparticles (Fr\u00f6hlich, 2012). Meanwhile, the less toxic components of nano-LSW-low are less toxic to L02 cells. \n\nNext, we further explored the anti-tumor efficacy of nano-LSW-low in mice. We found that nano-LSW-low is less toxic to normal tissues than LSW-ET in an acute toxicity study (Supplementary Figure 2). Simultaneously, nano-LSW has a good therapeutic effect on liver cancer induced by nanoDEN. The reason is that nanoliposomes exhibit good passive targeting and can selectively concentrate in the rich organizers of the reticuloendothelial system in the body (Sasikumar and Kamalasanan, 2017). Moreover, because of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), nanoliposomes build accumulation in tumors preferentially. In addition, there is no structurally functional lymphatic system in the tumor tissue; thus, the nanoparticles are rarely cleared, and the drug is retained in the tumor tissue (Dong and Mumper, 2010). In previous studies, we demonstrated that lipid nanoparticles can enhance the liver targeting of drug. Therefore, we hypothesize that nano-LSW also exhibits good liver targeting. \n\nFurthermore, our results demonstrated that the high expression of inflammatory (COX-2 and TNF-a), steatosis (PPAR-g and AP-2), fibrosis (Smad-2 and TGF-b1), PCNA and HMGB1 proteins in tumors was downregulated after treatment with nano-LSW (Supplementary Figure 3; Figures 6 and 8). In liver cancer, high expression of the inflammatory factor COX-2 activates the nuclear expression of b-catenin.",

These include the ability to (1) passively target the liver tissue through hepatic macrophages (mainly Kupffer cells), (2) be modified with hepatocyte-targeting molecules to achieve active distribution of the drug(s) in the liver, (3) achieve environment-responsive drug release by bonding environment-sensitive ligands based on the intracellular environment of liver cells, and (4) encapsulate a variety of drug molecules simultaneously, thereby achieving codelivery of multiple therapeutic drugs with different efficacies. \n\nAs HBV mainly infects hepatocytes [23], targeting both liver tissue and hepatic parenchymal cells is essential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of anti-hepatitis B drugs. As shown in Figure 3 [24], the uptake processes of nanoparticle drug delivery systems are as follows: (a) prevention of ingestion by Kupffer cells (by use of nanoparticles <200 nm), (b) passage of nanoparticles <200 nm through endothelial gaps, (c) diffusion of the nanoparticles across the loosely organized extracellular matrix in the Disse space, (d) nonspecific endocytosis of hepatic stellate cells, and (e) receptor-mediated active uptake of hepatocytes. However, the in vivo uptake of nanoparticle delivery systems by hepatocytes is limited. Targeting hepatocytes specifically was shown to reduce the accumulation of vectors in hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, as well as the hepatotoxicity [25]. Therefore, hepatocyte targeting is significant for the safe and efficient application of nanoparticle delivery systems. Currently, the main strategies include the following:",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are specific to the liver microcirculation. LSEC line the liver capillaries and transport blood from branches of the portal vein and the hepatic artery into the central vein of liver lobules. They provide a porous barrier between blood components and liver parenchymal cells, i.e., hepatocytes. Moreover their endocytic capacities make them effective scavengers for molecules such as albumin, acetylated low-density lipoproteins (Ac-LDL) and antigens in the bloodstream [1,2]. \n\nAt the interface between blood components and parenchymal cells, LSEC are able to interact with various cell types and participate in several physiological and pathological events. For example, LSEC dysregulation is believed to constitute a critical step in liver fibrosis [3] and in non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis progression [4]. Moreover, LSEC have dual roles in liver tissue in the surgical setting, having deleterious effects through involvement in ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver transplantation [5,6] and beneficial effects through regulating and orchestrating liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy [7]. Notably, we detailed in a recent review the potential role of the interactions between platelets and LSEC in the regenerative process [8,9]. \n\nTo study the biological functions of LSEC and to identify the interplay between LSEC and other blood or liver cells, techniques allowing for the isolation and purification of LSEC have been developed over the last decades. Early methods for liver cell dispersion relied on liver tissue mechanical disruption or on differences in cell-specific sensitivity to enzymatic digestion. LSEC enrichment was obtained by isopycnic gradient centrifugation or selective adherence to materials. Currently, published isolation protocols rely on liver tissue enzymatic digestion, discarding parenchymal cells and then further purification of LSEC from the non-parenchymal cell fraction.",

Some results suggested that at least immediately after administration, uptake into the liver occurs primarily via KCs rather than via parenchymal or endothelial cells. 3,4 Morais et al 5 evaluated the biodistribution of 20 nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with six different surface coatings and demonstrated that GNPs are rapidly distributed, while liver is the preferential accumulation organ, with GNPs trapped in KCs, hepatocytes, and endosomes. Sadauskas et al 6 showed that GNPs, independent of size (2 and 40 nm), were taken up primarily by KCs in the liver and secondarily by macrophages at other sites. 7 NPs cannot simply enter cells via diffusion. The pathways of uptake of NPs can be divided into phagocytosis/ macropinocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and passive penetration. Their regular accumulation in the liver makes NPs ideal candidates for treating hepatic diseases upon parenteral administration; however, it also puts them into focus due to the liver toxicity of therapeutic strategies that do not intend to target the liver as well as the decreased circulation time, which reduces the pharmacological effect. This is an urgent problem with the use of NPs. 8",

Various metabolic pathways distribute along the porto-central axis of a liver lobule. GS, glutamine synthesis; Cho, cholesterol synthesis. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) line the hepatic blood vessels, while liver-resident macrophages, i.e. Kupffer cells, are localized within the hepatic sinusoids. Hepatocytes are located behind the space of Disse with a sinusoidal (basolateral) membrane towards blood circulation. Figure adapted from Mosby et al. [48] [62]. Many structural and functional features have been elucidated by Braet and Wisse [54,[63][64][65][66][67]. LSECs line the hepatic sinusoids and form pores, so-called fenestrations, that are clustered in sieve plates (Fig. 2). Endothelial fenestrae range from 50 to 200 nm in diameter and differ between species (Table 1). Therefore, liver fenestrae physically restrict circulating LNPs' access to the perisinusoidal space and thus limit cellular interactions with hepatocytes according to size. Several research groups have investigated using pore-opening substances to modulate fenestrae size with limited success [64]. In addition to their structural characteristics, LSECs have high endocytic activity. A number of scavenger receptors, including stabilin-2, can efficiently sequester anionic nanoparticles [68].",

Nevertheless, these specialized macrophages bearing high phagocytic activity are part of the innate immune system [25] and their stimulation can activate the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF\u03b1, a cytokine, provoking collagen synthesis and fibrosis [34]. \n\nTo clarify the quantitative role of Kupffer cells for potential harmful effects of injected nanocrystals, clodronate containing liposomes were injected to ablate Kupffer cell populations in the liver selectively [35]. The F4/80 (encoded by Emr1) molecule is solely expressed on the surface of macrophages and serves as a marker for mature macrophage tissues, including Kupffer cells in liver, splenic red pulp macrophages or brain microglia [36]. Two days after clodronate treatment, Emr1 expression was undetectable demonstrating effective ablation of Kupffer cells in our system (Figure 6A). Furthermore, consecutive injections of pure lipid micelles or micelles containing either QDs or SPIOs in the presence or absence of Kupffer cells had no acute influence on TNF\u03b1 or Cxcl10 expression (Figure 6B, C) indicating that heavy metals such as cadmium released from QDs or iron released from SPIOs did not acutely influence the inflammatory status of the liver. \n\nHowever, specific target cells can be of transient relevance and heavy metals released after QDs or SPIOs uptake may traverse through different target cell types in a time-dependent manner. Given the limitation of the study that gene expression of proinflammatory markers was analysed 48 h (Figure 3) or 4 h (Figure 6) after the injection of nanoparticles, we cannot  QDs-micelles uptake into hepatocytes is dependent on apolipoprotein E.

The isolation of hepatocytes was performed using density gradientbased separation. Then, magnetic beads were used for the isolation of KCs and LSECs (Fig. 2O), respectively, and the rest of cells are considered as other nonparenchymal cells. As shown in Fig. 2 (P and Q) , the exosome positive rate of KCs, LSECs, hepatocytes, and other nonparenchymal cells were 64.5, 58.2, 22.9, and 26.7%, respectively. In addition, the relative mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of KCs (62.8) and LSECs (61.7) was also higher than those of hepatocytes (37.7) and other nonparenchymal cells (26.1). KCs and LSECs are the main composition of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system, and these two cell types are largely involved in the pathological process of liver diseases, including liver fibrosis, hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury, drug-induced injury, HCC, etc. (34)(35)(36). Hepatocytes are the predominant liver cells, comprising about 57% of total liver cells, followed by LSECs (23.2%), KCs (15%), and other liver cells (4.8%) (37).

For example, circUGP2 LNPs inhibited tumor progression via p53 activation while partially targeting Kupffer cells. 33 Cre mRNA-loaded COATSOMESS-OP also achieved precise gene editing in hepatocytes (Cre mRNA encodes the Cre recombinase enzyme). 73 Biodegradable LNPs delivered ARG1 mRNA for metabolic restoration in arginase deficiency models, 74 and CL4H6 siRNA-loaded LNPs efficiently silenced hepatocyte genes with high specificity. 75 (6) Target cell specificity is a requirement for successful delivery. \n\nKupffer cells often sequester LNPs, reducing delivery to hepatocytes. However, depletion strategies have been shown to improve hepatocyte targeting by minimizing LNP clearance by Kupffer cells. 35 For example, depletion of Kupffer cells was shown to improve nanoparticle delivery to tumors by up to 150-fold, though the maximum tumor accumulation remains only 2% of the injected dose, demonstrating systemic challenges in nanoparticle targeting. LSECs, because of their fenestrations, facilitated selective delivery, such as for receptor-specific LNPs. 23 7][78] Similarly, targeted therapies using hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/epidermal growth factor (EGF) mRNA and NM-FGF19 mRNA-loaded LNPs successfully treated chronic liver injuries and metabolic dysfunction by delivering therapeutic payloads to specific hepatic cells. 79,80 ecent studies demonstrated new mechanisms for liver-targeted delivery. For example, anionic LNPs targeted Kupffer cells and LSECs through stabilin receptors, 45 while GalNAc-LNPs entered hepatocytes through asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor-mediated uptake, independent of LDL receptor. 81 (7) Some LNP formulations demonstrated extrahepatic targeting beyond the liver.",

Minority cell populations support hepatocytes and maintain the hepatic environment. The liver's lobular structure promotes effective bidirectional intercellular communication and molecular information transfer through ECVs (Figure 2). For example, hepatocyte-derived ECVs carry arginase-1, which modulates endothelial cell function, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, which promotes liver regeneration. LSEC-derived ECVs modulate hepatic stellate cell activity, and HSC-derived ECVs may facilitate HCC progression. Cholangiocyte-derived ECVs affect bile acid homeostasis and promote healing.

Parenchymal cells are the main cells of liver. Many fatal diseases occur in hepatocytes, such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, enzyme deficiency and hepatoma. Because of the poor efficiency of current drugs uptaken by hepatocytes, there are few effective therapeutic methods for hepatic diseases. Hence, it is important to target drugs to the hepatocytes. \n\nApplication of nanoparticles (NP) in drug delivery systems (DDS) is of particular interest because they provide drug targeting possibilities and sustained release action. However, they have some disadvantages such as rapid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) within seconds or minutes after injection due to phagocytosis by macrophages in the liver and spleen. \n\nReceptor-mediated drug targeting is a promising approach to selective drug delivery. One particular method exploits the mechanisms of sugar recognition of some specific cells. Among various types of cells in the body, hepatocytes exclusively have high affinity cell-surface receptors that can bind to asialoglycoproteins and subsequently internalize them to the cell interior. Delivery of drugs using liposomes bound to asialoglycoprotein in a specific manner would provide significant therapeutic benefits to hepatic disease. Extensive studies on chemical modification of liposomes with asialoglycoproteins [1][2][3] or low-molecular weight glycolipid have been carried out to achieve effective targeting to hepatocytes [4][5][6][7][8] . However, it was reported that galactose-bearing liposomes are also taken up by Kupffer cells, and the distribution of these liposomes in hepatocytes is not very high [9] . Therefore, the discovery of a new ligand instead of using the conventional ones requires investigation.",

            "text": "In summary, we show stab2 is an important (scavenger) receptor mediating the uptake of circulating nanoparticles by SECs. In particular, anionic nanoparticles, between 50 and 250 nm in size, are avidly taken up by SECs in a stab2-dependent fashion. Here, binding and uptake appear independent of material and functional properties of nanoparticles and are solely dependent on surface charge. Given the comparable sizes and surface charge of many blood-borne viruses, [16][17][18]57 clearance of these circulating pathogens by LSECs is also potentially mediated by stab2. These findings, combined with the high expression of stab2 by LSECs within the mammalian liver, 11 implicate SECs as an important cell-type in the binding, uptake, and clearance of administered nanoparticles. As such, we support the re-adoption of the RES, over the MPS, as the most accurate term to describe the specialized cellular components involved in nanoparticle clearance from circulation. 58 The ultimate goal of many nanoparticle-based technologies is cell-type-specific targeting. Yet reported targeting efficiencies rarely surpass 1% of the total injected nanoparticle dose. 1 A major contributing factor has been off-target nanoparticle interactions within the mammalian liver. 5 By revealing the molecular basis of nanoparticle interactions with specific cells of the embryonic zebrafish, we have been able to demonstrate nanoparticle targeting of, and drug delivery to, specific cell types with homologues in the mammalian liver. In addition, we show these interactions can be effectively inhibited by dextran sulfate. As stab2 is not essential for normal adult physiology, 37 this offers a simple method to extend circulation lifetimes of nanoparticles by minimizing potential off-target liver interactions. 59 This will likely be particularly beneficial in instances where active targeting of nanoparticles to cell types beyond the liver (for example, cancer cells) is desired.\n\nImportantly, the SEC/selective drug delivery we describe has not resulted from adding further complexity to nanoparticle designs.

However, HSCs activation often leads to the overexpression of several cell surface receptors such as collagen type 4, TGF-\u03b2, connective tissue growth factor receptors, PDGFR\u03b2, RBP receptor, synaptophysin, cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (IGF2R), and low-density lipoprotein receptor [24].

            "text": "Although the final destination of EVs is variable, based on pharmacokinetic studies, one can conclude that the liver precedes other organs in eliminating EVs independently of their protein content. These micro-or nanoparticles are removed mainly by Kupffer cells, but liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatocytes are also involved in this process [14]. Kupffer cells, being liver macrophages, primarily clear those EVs that show some similarity to red blood cells or opsonized microorganisms. These have surface markers, such as CD44 or complement components CD55, CD59 or phosphatidylserine [15,16]. Nevertheless, regardless of their protein content, Kupffer cells eliminate all kinds of EVs. Other liver cells, such as hepatocytes and LSECs are also capable of taking up vesicles, but to a lesser extent [14]. Imai and coworkers showed that exosomes derived from the mouse melanoma cell line B16BL6 were taken up by macrophages in the liver and spleen, but not in the lungs [17]. Bala et al. showed that after intravenous administration of plasma containing miR-155-enriched exosome into miR-155-deficient mice, most of the miR-155 was found in the liver [18,19]. These exosomes were rapidly cleared from the serum, the maximum level was observed after 5 min and they were not detectable after 30 min. In another study, time-dependent changes were observed in different organs. The exosomes accumulated primarily in the liver, and microvesicles in the lungs. The hepatic level of exosomes was the highest in the first hour after administration, while the amount of microvesicles peaked in the first 60 min in the lungs and then in the liver [20]. EVs that escape from tissues such as the liver can reach their acceptor cells in other tissues or organs-even tumors-and be removed by those recipient cells [21].",

Within the liver, most nanoparticles are thought to be sequestered by macrophages (Kupffer cells), although significant nanoparticle interactions with other hepatic cells have also been observed. To achieve effective cell-specific targeting of drugs through nanoparticle encapsulation, improved mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle\u2013liver interactions is required. Here, we show the caudal vein of the embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) can be used as a model for assessing nanoparticle interactions with mammalian liver sinusoidal (or scavenger) endothelial cells (SECs) and macrophages. We observe that anionic nanoparticles are primarily taken up by SECs and identify an essential requirement for the scavenger receptor, stabilin-2 (stab2) in this process. Importantly, nanoparticle\u2013SEC interactions can be blocked by dextran sulfate, a competitive inhibitor of stab2 and other scavenger receptors. Finally, we exploit nanoparticle\u2013SEC interactions to demonstrate targeted intracellular drug delivery resulting in the selective deletion of a single blood vessel in the zebrafish embryo. Together, we propose stab2 inhibition or targeting as a general approach for modifying nanoparticle\u2013liver interactions of a wide range of nanomedicines.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle (NP)-based drug delivery has emerged as a new alternative therapeutic strategy for many diseases [1]. Since the NPs allow the drug to reach whole liver cells such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatocytes, and Kupffer cells, the cell fate of the NPs is important [2,3]. Drug delivery effects of NPs can vary depending on targeted cell types as well as the locations of targeted cells in the liver. Targeting the right cells can significantly improve the efficiency of NP-based drug delivery and also enhance stability and safety [4]. Conversely, when NPs are mainly engulfed by Kupffer cells, this can lower the level of NPs acting on other cells [2]. Therefore, the selective delivery of NPs to the targeted specific cells is one of the most important issues in NP-based drug delivery. Modification of the NP surface is a universal approach to improving the efficacy of NP targeting to specific cell types [4]. Information on the relative NP uptake quantity per liver cell is essential to ensuring accurate cell targeting. \n\nAn NP is a small object with a diameter of 1-500 nm that can be composed of various materials, such as silica, polylactic-co-glycolic acid, and silver [2,5]. NPs are widely applied in medicine and pharmaceutical fields. Particularly, low-toxicity silica NPs are used in many biomedical applications, due to their biocompatibility, low toxicity, and expandable composition [6][7][8]. Precision control of silica particle size, porosity, crystallinity, and shape allows nanostructures to be tuned for a variety of applications [6]. In addition, many possible surface modifications of silica NPs enable the precise control of surface chemistry to regulate drug or chemical loading, and the dispersion, blood circulation, and site-specific targeting of the NPs [9]. The ability to combine these properties makes silica NPs a viable platform for biomedical imaging, analysis, delivery, monitoring, and resection therapies. For instance, silica nanoparticles can be functionalized as contrast agents to enable bio-imaging [10].",

The complexity of liver cell-cell interactions makes it difficult to establish the chronology of cell-specific changes in structural and functional phenotypes [19]. Damage-associated molecular patterns and pro-inflammatory microvesicles (exosomes) released from steatotic and ballooned hepatocytes activate Kupffer cells [39] and the liver inflammasome [40]. LSECs respond to shear stress and hypoxia by losing B. NAFLD is associated with structural and functional changes that may profoundly affect sinusoid homeostasis by promoting endothelial dysfunction, distorting sinusoidal microanatomy and disrupting cross-talk among various liver cells, ultimately leading to increased intravascular hepatic resistance and contributing to disease progression (see main text and Figure 2 for cellular and molecular pathways involved in this process). LSEC: liver sinusoidal endothelial cell their fenestrated endothelium (capillarization), which is a cardinal feature of endothelial dysfunction [41]. Capillarized LSECs impair hepatic lipid transport and metabolism [42], secrete bioactive substances that promote microthrombosis and angiogenesis [43], and their diminished nitric oxide (NO) production allows hepatic stellate cells to change their phenotype [44]. First, upregulation of smooth muscle proteins actin and myosin in stellate cells increases their contractility, which may impede sinusoidal flow similar to pericytes in the systemic circulation [45]. Second, activated stellate cells become the source of extracellular matrix deposits, resulting in gradually more severe fibrosis and encroachment on the sinusoidal lumen [46,47].",

            "text": "The primary cause of the ineffective delivery, and thus translation of nanotherapies, is the capture of the vast majority of the nanoparticles by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). The MPS is composed of monocytes and macrophages primarily located in the liver, spleen, and lung, which selectively capture nanometer-sized particles to regulate homeostasis and microbial immunity. Nanoparticles are efficiently sequestered to these cell populations and accumulate in these organs in varying proportions dependent on nanoparticle size, shape, and surface modification. Attempts have been made to overcome these challenges, for instance, stabilizing particles sterically rather than electrostatically [5], conjugating \"self\" component(s) to the nanoparticle surface [6], and coating nanoparticles with cell membranes extracted from red blood cells or leukocytes [7]. Despite these developments, there remains a lack of understanding concerning the precise chemical interactions between nanoparticles and cells and organ architecture of the MPS. \n\nHowever, if we reframe our therapeutic objectives to the diseases that affect the major organs of the MPS, such as the liver, spleen and lungs, the accumulation of nanoparticles in these organs may enhance delivery and therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle-conjugated drugs. Therapeutic treatments of liver inflammation and fibrosis by nanomedicine with cell-specific targeting strategies have been proposed [8]. Moreover, for drugs that may not need to enter into cells or drugs that have broad effects on multiple cell types, enriched tissue concentrations could be beneficial. Therefore, other diseases of the liver and spleen, such as hepatitis, hepatic carcinoma, fatty liver, or splenomegaly caused by leukemia, lymphoma, or AIDS, could also be targets of nanomedicine. An attractive group of diseases affecting the cells of the MPS are the genetically inherited and severe lysosomal storage diseases and glycogen storage diseases, which may be attractive targets of pharmaceutical companies, as these are rare diseases and treatments may gain lucrative orphan drug statuses.",

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164]. Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76]. A recent publication suggested that the ionizable lipid composition plays a major role in the corona formed [165].

We injected the lipid nanoparticles intravenously (iv) into MM-bearing NCG mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) previously inoculated with 2 \u00d7 10 6 MM1.S-GFP-Luc cell/mouse, and MM progression in mice was confirmed by bioluminescent imaging (BLI). Twenty-four hours post nanoparticles injection, mice were sacrificed and their BM, kidney, and liver were harvested. Then, we analyzed the binding of the lipid nanoparticles to mononuclear cells (MNCs) and quantified the levels of MM-GFP+ cells, in each organ. We found a significantly higher accumulation of the Lipo E-X lipid nanoparticles in the BM and kidney, compared to the nontargeted lipid nanoparticles (Fig. 2A). We also found a high nonspecific accumulation of both targeted and non-targeted particles in the liver. Liver accumulation is expected, as lipid nanoparticles are known to accumulate in the liver due to their lipidic nature and their capture by Kupffer cells. Although BTZ-loaded lipid nanoparticles may have side effect in the lever; however, we expect these to be mild due to the lower activity of proteasomes in the liver compared to MM cells. Moreover, we examined the correlation between the presence of MM in the organs and the specificity of the accumulation of lipid nanoparticles; we determined the specific accumulation as the ratio of the binding of targeted / non-targeted lipid nanoparticles and the presence of MM was expressed as the % of MM-GFP+ in MNCs in each organ. We found a direct linear correlation between the presence of MM1 cells and the specific accumulation of targeted lipid nanoparticles in each organ (Fig. 2B).

LSECs characteristically possess open fenestrae and unique in comparison to other endothelial cells, they lack an underlying basement membrane. These open fenestrae are 50-150 nm wide pores, which cluster together to act as a two-way channel for the flow of soluble molecules through the endothelial barrier between the blood and hepatocytes [38]. LSECs are also highly efficient scavengers, capable of clearing macromolecules, such as stabilin bound oxidized low density lipoprotein, by endocytic receptor-uptake and trans-cytosis to the Space of Disse, further contributing to the delivery of metabolic substrates from the blood to hepatocytes [39,40].\n\nSince the liver directly receives and processes antigen-enriched blood from the portal circulation and is therefore highly susceptible to the influx of pathogens, the liver has a central role in immunity [41]. Towards this function, LSECs provide an adhesive niche for myeloid cells and lymphocytes and the unique structure of LSECs allows na\u00efve lymphocytes to contact hepatocytes via cytoplasmic extensions through LSEC fenestrations [41,42]. LSECs also contribute towards regulation of T-cell activation and tolerance through their antigen-presenting capabilities [39]. Further contributing to the immunological function of the liver are Kupffer cells (KCs). Part of the reticuloendothelial system, these liver-resident macrophages patrol the sinusoidal blood under physiological conditions, acting as a filter to eliminate gut-derived bacteria and microbial by-products, as well as phagocytosing spent erythrocytes [43]. Within the sinusoid, KCs interact with lymphocytes, and are key in promoting T-cell tolerance to prevent immune responses to harmless antigens, which is imperative given the continuous exposure to innocuous antigens from the gut [44]. A wide repertoire of tissue-resident lymphocytes are found in the liver including conventional CD",

            "text": "The hallmark of MASLD is hepatic fat accumulation, and the underlying mechanisms of this process have been shown to drive CVD. The liver acquires lipids by uptake of fatty acids and via de novo lipogenesis, while it disposes lipids by fatty acid oxidation and by exporting as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). When hepatic lipid acquisition exceeds disposal, it results in accumulation of hepatic fats (36). \n\nAt cellular level in the liver, lipotoxicity due to excess lipids triggers hepatocyte death, Kupffer cells and immune cells activation, and increased inflammatory molecules. The liver has unique liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) that cover hepatic sinusoids between blood and hepatocytes to facilitate the exchange of macromolecules through distinct fenestrae. LSECs play a critical role in filtration, vascular tone, immune response, and endocytosis among other functions (37,38). Lipotoxicity and inflammation may cause capillarization (differentiation) of LSECs, a process whereby LSECs lose the normal structure of their fenestrae, leading to molecular transport dysfunction. \n\nA study in mice showed that LSEC capillarization occurs in early stages in MASLD and precedes the activation of Kupffer cells and Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Researchers detected morphological changes in size and number of LSEC fenestrae, and increased expression of CD31 and CD34, both indicators of capillarization (39). \n\nIn a mouse model where LSEC fenestrae formation is impaired due to plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein deficiency, the mice developed multiple hallmarks of MASLD such as steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, infiltration of macrophages, and collagen production by HSCs (40). Impaired fenestrae in LSEC in this mouse also causes higher plasma levels of LDL, cholesterol, triglycerides, and lower HDL level, showing the impact on LSEC capillarization on CV health (40).",

            "text": "Along the lines above, Ouyang et al. [108] reported that doses above 1 trillion nanoparticles in mice overwhelmed Kupffer cell uptake rates, decreased liver clearance, prolonged circulation, and increased nanoparticle tumor delivery. This enabled up to 12% tumor delivery efficiency to 93% of cells in tumors, thereby boosting the therapeutic efficacy of Doxil \u00d2 . A study that administered cationic and ionizable lipid LNPs carrying siRNA to apoE \u00c0/\u00c0 mice demonstrated that hepatic uptake of ionizable, but not cationic, LNPs was apoE dependent. This observation suggests that LNP charge plays a role in LNP biodistribution [34]. Surface charge indeed controls organ-specific delivery [109]. A strategy called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) that adds a supplemental component (termed a SORT molecule) to the four conventional LNP lipids allowed LNPs to be systematically engineered to deliver nucleic acid therapies to the lungs, spleens, and livers of mice following i.v. administration. The SORT molecule varied from permanently positively charged ionizable lipids to negatively charged lipids. LNPs modified to include a significant mol% of permanently charged lipids sorted toward the lungs. Previous studies have shown that positively charged nanoparticles tend to accumulate in the lungs [110]. Additionally, highly positively charged particles generally aggregate in biological fluids and these agglomerates could accumulate in the narrow lung capillaries. Another explanation could be that the first highly vascularized organ that nanoparticles encounter after an i.v. tail vein injection is the lungs, in which blood flow is slower due to capillary circulation [110]. Thus, the nonspecific interactions between the negatively charged sulfated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans displayed by the plasma membranes of capillary endothelial cells and the positively charged nanoparticles could trap the nanoparticles in the lungs [110]. Adding permanently negatively charged SORT molecules to LNPs directed them to the spleen, while the conventional (with close to neutral surface charge) LNPs homed to the liver. It may be that changes in the apparent pK a values endow distinct protein corona",

            "text": "Kupffer cells phagocytose and destroy pathogens and other foreign objects present in the blood. The uptake and retention rate are highly associated with the nanoparticle's surface charge, size, and ligand chemistry. In vitro study shows that nanoparticles with strong anionic or cationic surface charges will interact with serum protein, forming a protein corona and aggregates, causing an increased interaction with macrophages [35,36]. PEGylated nanoparticles are less efficiently taken by phagocytes. Sinusoidal endothelial cells found lining the vasculature of the liver sinusoid are also involved in innate immunity. It is involved in the elimination of waste macromolecules, including components of connective tissue and hyaluronan from blood circulation by receptor-ligand interactions. Both Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells likely compete for the nanoparticles present in the circulation. In addition, the nanoparticles' physicochemical properties, such as the hydrodynamic size, influence the mechanism of cellular internalization. Nanoparticles with a diameter greater than 100 nm or aggregated nanoparticles lower than 100 nm will have greater interaction with Kupffer cells. In contrast, sinusoidal endothelial cells might take up smaller monodisperse nanoparticles to a higher degree [36]. Several key studies discussed above found that the liver preferentially took up the folate-targeting nanoparticles more than its non-targeting counterpart. Perhaps this phenomenon might be due to the FR-\u03b2 expressed by activated macrophages present in the liver. Several studies noted that the EPR effect may have a lack of impact on shortcirculating folate-functionalized nanoparticles due to rapid uptake by the liver [14,18]. \n\nAltering folate blood serum levels may have an impact on the folate-functionalized nanoparticles' effectiveness by affecting liver uptake. Low-folate diets are demonstrated to elevate tissue retention of the folate-functionalized carrier, subsequently depleting the amount present in the circulation [14,37].",

Processing 30% of the total blood volume every minute, [49] the liver encounters antigens Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2023, 12,2202238 www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de deriving both from the gastrointestinal tract as well as arterial blood. This allows the liver to play a key role in immune surveillance as resident immune cells must clear pathogens deriving from the gut as well as systemic circulation. This organ is wellequipped in this capacity, containing the single largest population of macrophages (residential Kupffer cells) and the greatest densities of natural killer cells. [49] On the other hand, the liver is also intimately involved in inducing tolerance to dietary and commensal antigens. Resident APCs such as Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelia cells (LSECs) are key players in mediating liver tolerance. [50] In particular, Kupffer cells clear cellular debris from the liver without stimulating an inflammatory response. LSECs present antigen to CD4 + T cells via MHC-II but express low levels of costimulatory molecules. This combination of antigen without costimulation makes LSECs a main driver in the development of T REGS (Figure 1e). [51,52] Most biomaterial drug delivery vehicles designed to target liver immune cells are nanoparticles (NPs) administered intravenously (IV) to take advantage of the high blood flow volume through this organ. NPs can be decorated with ligands that are highly expressed on liver immune cells to enable receptormediated active targeting. Liu et al. demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by modifying the surface of polymeric NPs with ligands targeting scavenger and mannose receptors [55] or stabilin receptors, [56] which are highly expressed on LSECs. The authors showed that while NPs in the 200-300 nm range accumulated almost exclusively in the liver, targeting ligands were necessary for antigen colocalization with LSECs. These and other similar studies have motivated the design of NPs decorated with sugar [53] or antibody [57,58] ligands for",

They perform multiple functions such as metabolic (lipid, carbohydrate, and protein), detoxifying (xenobiotics), and secretory (bile) functions to ensure metabolic homeostasis.\n\nThe remaining 30% of hepatic cells are primarily HSCs, LSECs, and KCs [135,136]. HSCs are mainly involved in the storage of vitamin A in lipid droplets (LDs) and regulation of extracellular matrix and may affect sinusoidal blood flow via their contractile properties [4,137]. LSECs constitute a permeable barrier within the liver sinusoids. They can promote the exchange of substances between the blood flow in the sinusoids and the surrounding tissues [138,139]. KCs are resident hepatic macrophages. They are considered to act as \"pathogen-scavengers\" that play a major role in the immune and inflammatory response of the liver [140].\n\n3.1. The Influence of Aging on Liver Cells. With age, the number of hepatocytes gradually decreases, the genome of hepatocytes becomes unstable, and the number of polyploid hepatocytes increases. Moreover, lipofuscin accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction also appear in senescent hepatocytes [4,141].\n\nIn addition, the number of HSCs increases, and the number of activated stellate cells, staining positive for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA, a stellate cell activation marker), increases as well [4]. In LSECs, aging leads to a decrease in the number and size of fenestrations, an increase in the deposition of basal collagen, and thickening of the endothelium [142] compromising the intercellular molecular exchange.

Liver uptake of the larger particles is faster than for smaller ones. Recent observations indicate that very small particles can pass through the sinusoidal fenestrations in the liver and gain access to the parenchymal cells of the liver. 43,44 Sonavane et al prepared gold nanoparticles of different particle sizes (15, 50, 100, and 200 nm) and distribution in organs like the liver, lung, and spleen and showed that tissue distribution of gold nanoparticles is size-dependent. 45 The smallest gold nanoparticles (15 nm) show the most widespread organ distribution.\n\nThe distribution of pegylated and nonpegylated (control) nanoparticles has been evaluated on these tissues in rats. The fluorescence microscopy images of liver and spleen tissue sections are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. Twentyfour hours after IV injection of pegylated nanoparticle suspension ( Figures 6C and 7C), only a negligible fluorescence was detected in the liver and spleen when compared with nonpegylated nanoparticles (Figures 6D and 7D). A strong green fluorescence due to the accumulation of nonpegylated nanoparticles could be clearly observed, especially in Kupffer cells, which are located mainly in the periportal region of  the liver, and few very bright spots were observed, probably because of aggregation. Green fluorescence along the lining of the liver sinusoids identified endocytosed nanoparticles by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. On the contrary, the observed weak yellow fluorescence in tissues following injection of pegylated nanoparticles suggests that pegylation of the PBLG nanoparticles was efficient for avoiding capture by the MPS. Similarly, macrophages of the spleen were much less deeply stained after injection of pegylated nanoparticles when compared with nonpegylated nanoparticles ( Figure 7C and",

LSECs further act as a platform for adhesion of various liver-resident immune cell populations such as Kupffer cells, innate lymphoid cells or liver dendritic cells. In addition to having an extraordinary scavenger function, LSECs possess potent immune functions, serving as sentinel cells to detect microbial infection through pattern recognition receptor activation and as antigen (cross)-presenting cells. LSECs cross-prime naive CD8 T cells, causing their rapid differentiation into memory T cells that relocate to secondary lymphoid tissues and provide protection when they re-encounter the antigen during microbial infection. Cross-presentation of viral antigens by LSECs derived from infected hepatocytes triggers local activation of effector CD8 T cells and thereby assures hepatic immune surveillance. The immune function of LSECs complements conventional immune-activating mechanisms to accommodate optimal immune surveillance against infectious microorganisms while preserving the integrity of the liver as a metabolic organ.",

Specially designed liposomes can be targeted with a high efficiency to LSECs.

This technique opens up attractive possibilities to modulate the liver sieve of LSECs with liposome-encapsulated microfilament-disrupting drugs in vivo. \n \nThe goal of this study was to alter the sieve's porosity by using cytochalasin B-loaded Aco-HSA liposomes. The increase in the liver sieve porosity induced by cytochalasin B (CB) may be exploited therapeutically to improve the extraction of atherogenic lipoproteins from the circulation; or to enhance the efficiency of liposome-mediated gene or drug delivery to hepatocytes.",

They play a central role in maintaining organ homeostasis by regulating physiological processes and metabolic activity linked to digestion, including the metabolization of carbohydrates and lipids and the production of bile. The majority of the remaining non-parenchymal cell population (NPC, 20-40% of the total liver mass) is composed of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs, 10-20%) that form a permeable barrier between sinusoidal vessels and hepatocytes. Biliary epithelial cells (BECs), which constitute 5% of the total liver mass, will be described in detail in Section 2.1 [9]. Kupffer cells (KCs), also known as intravascular resident macrophages, account for 4-8%. They are located within the sinusoids and primarily perform immunological tasks. Hepatic stellate cells (SCs, 0.2-0.4%) are mesenchymal cells residing in the space of Disse, which is referred to as the space between LSECs and hepatic epithelial cells. SCs remain in a quiescent state; however, when triggered by liver damage, they become activated [1,2]. Moreover, circulating lymphocytes, consisting of T-cells (CD4 + /CD8 + ), B-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and NKT cells, are present. They interfere with antigen-presenting cells such as LSECs, KCs, and liver resident dendritic cells (DCs) or directly with hepatocytes, enabling adaptions of the immune response [2,10,11]. \n\nimportance of the chosen route of administration of these therapies and discus novel technologies, which may be advantageous when introducing such in treatment protocols.",

            "text": "LSECs are a unique endothelial cell type in the liver and provide appropriate support to hepatocytes. Even though the presence of LSECs is critical in a healthy liver, they play a critical role in disease initiation and progression. LSECs regulate hepatocyte regeneration and function through hepatic growth factors (HGF) and Wnt2 signaling (Yamane et al., 1994). Moreover, it is demonstrated that paracrine crosstalk between LSECs and HSCs is essential for HSCs activation after liver injury. In this situation, LSECs activate HSCs through the secretion of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibronectin EIIIA, and exosomes containing sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) (Jarnagin et al., 1994). \n\nMoreover, LSECs play a crucial role in the regulation of the liver immune, leukocyte adhesion, and viral clearance (Warren et al., 2007). Since endothelial cells have a critical role in the disease signaling pathway, they are frequently co-cultured with hepatocytes to improve in vitro disease modeling (Ding et al., 2010;Natarajan et al., 2017). Str\u00f6bel and colleagues (2021) presented a 3D in vitro microtissue model by co-culturing of primary LSECs, hepatocytes, Kupffer, and HSCs. Upon exposure to the lipotoxic component, the microtissues show pathophysiological features of NASH, including lipid accumulation and pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. \n\nSince there is no unique surface marker for LSECs, their identification and isolation are challenging (Poisson et al., 2017). In addition, the primary LSECs are often unstable under in vitro culture conditions; therefore, endothelial cells from other sources, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HU-VECs), are employed to produce liver microtissues.",

As NPs move along the sinusoid, they will come into contact with sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells (KCs), T cells, and DCs. Depending on their physicochemical properties, NPs have better access through fenestrae to enter the space of Disse and contact with hepatocytes. The smaller NPs may transcytose through the hepatocytes and enter the bile duct through bile canaliculi. Conventional NPs are captured by the RES. Larger size, negatively charged, or hydrophilic NPs are preferentially swallowed by KCs via phagocytosis; NPs less than 200 nm NP or with negative surface charge or hydrophobicity tend to be taken up by endothelial cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis with a high exposure dose or long time. NPs less than 50 nm NP or hydrophilic NPs could be captured by stellate cells. Smaller   NPs with positive surface charge or hydrophobic NPs are  preferentially taken up by hepatocytes through clathrinmediated endocytosis. Hence, we reviewed the latest advances in remodeling the hepatic fibrotic microenvironment with emerging monotherapies, with particular attention to remodeling immune regulation, metabolic reprogramming, ECM deposition, and hypoxia-induced vascular production in the hepatic fibrotic microenvironment. Finally, the nanoadvantages and challenges of engineered NPs targeting APCs or directly targeting T cells for immunotherapy of liver fibrosis were highlighted in this review.",

However, targeted modulation of LSECs is still not achieved thus far. Here, we report LSECs are specifically targeted and modulated by melittin nanoparticles (\u03b1-melittin-NPs). Intravital imaging shows that LSECs fluoresce within 20\u2009s after intravenous injection of \u03b1-melittin-NPs. \u03b1-melittin-NPs trigger the activation of LSECs and lead to dramatic changes of cytokine/chemokine milieu in the liver, which switches the hepatic immunologic environment to the activated state. As a result, \u03b1-melittin-NPs resist the formation of metastatic lesions with high efficiency. More strikingly, the survival rate reaches 80% in the spontaneous liver metastatic tumor model. Our research provides support for the use of \u03b1-melittin-NPs to break LSEC-mediated immunologic tolerance, which opens an avenue to control liver metastasis through the immunomodulation of LSECs. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells are known to promote immune tolerance in liver. Here, the authors target these cells using melittin nanoparticles and show alterations in the liver immune environment and suppression of liver metastases.",

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

Of note, however, when we stained liver the single-cell preparations for Kupffer cell markers F4/80 and Tim4 in combination with an Fc\u03b3RIIb-specific antibody, we found two F4/80 and Tim4-doublepositive subpopulations that differed markedly with respect to Fc\u03b3RIIb expression (Figure 6A). Whereas CD31 + CD102 + SSC high cells represented a population with very high Fc\u03b3RIIb (CD32b) expression (Figure 6A, central panel), the nonendothelial population (CD31 \u2212 CD102 \u2212 SSC low ) moderately expressed Fc\u03b3RIIb (right panel). In addition, we noted that their relative amount varied to a great extent in the individual preparations. Of note, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are known to express high levels of Fc\u03b3RIIb [55]. Moreover, Lynch et al. showed that Kupffer cell preparations may contain a pronounced fraction of LSEC that mimic Kupffer cells with respect to cell surface marker expressions [56] due to a tight binding of the Kupffer cell membrane to the LSEC surface. To account for this issue, we added endothelial markers CD31 and/or CD102 to our FACS panel and found that, among the F4/80 Tim4-double-positive cells, the CD31 + CD102 + cells had a high side scatter (SSC high ), which reflected a high granularity/complexity and very high Fc\u03b3RIIb expression. In contrast, the nonendothelial CD31 \u2212 CD102 \u2212 SSC low cells showed a moderate Fc\u03b3RIIb expression (Figure 6A). This is in accordance with the data from Ganesan et al.

Liver-specific drug delivery is helpful in decreasing side effects by reducing drug distribution in non-target organ and improves the therapeutic efficacy by concomitantly increasing the drug concentration in target cells. 2 As the liver is the largest reticuloendothelial organ in the body, macrophages in the liver (i.e. kupffer cells) are attractive candidates to serve as the effector cells for therapy of hepatic diseases. 3,4 The body distribution and opsonisation of colloidal drug carrier systems by macrophages seem to be influenced by their particle sizes and surface characteristics. 5 The feasibility of particles ranged in 50-200nm to arrive at fenestration in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium might lead to hepatic accumulation after IV injection. Although the carrier systems like nano particles or liposomes could not directly reach the hepatocytes, the uptake of IV injected particulate drug carriers by macrophages cells might as well be the main limiting factor in the efficient targeting of a drug to the kupffer cells in the liver. 6",

            "text": "LSECs constitute approximately 50% of the non-parenchymal liver cell population, making them the predominant nonparenchymal cell type in the liver (28). Hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells form a lining along the low-shear sinusoidal capillary channels within the liver. As opposed to typical capillaries, LSECs feature window-like pore structures and the absence of a continuous basement membrane beneath the endothelium. This unique arrangement permits the formation of an unobstructed conduit between sinusoidal blood and the Disse space, facilitating the exchange of substrates between the bloodstream and liver parenchyma and regulating the movement of lipoproteins to and from hepatocytes (29) (Figure 1). LSECs stand out not only as the most permeable type of endothelial cell among mammals, but also exhibit a remarkable capacity for endocytosis. The primary receptors facilitating endocytosis include the mannose receptor, scavenger receptor, and Fcg receptor IIb2, which enable the removal of circulating waste materials (30,31). In a physiological context, LSECs contribute to Liver hemodynamics and histology. The liver receives a dual blood supply from both the hepatic artery and the portal vein. Approximately 20-30% of the liver's blood supply is derived from the hepatic artery, which primarily serves the purpose of oxygen delivery, while the remaining 70-80% originates from the portal vein, which is primarily responsible for nutrient supply. The fundamental structural and functional unit of the liver is the hepatic lobule, which is centered around the central vein, and hepatocytes radiate outward to form hepatic cord; between the hepatic cord is the hepatic sinusoid. The liver is composed of parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal cells, with liver non-parenchymal cells mainly encompassing LSEC, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and immune cells. The liver's various cell types interact, undergo precise regulation, and collaboratively perform specialized functions, collectively contributing to the biological functions of the liver.",

            "text": "0][11] Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), lining the sinusoids, are the most abundant nonparenchymal cells in the liver (w15% of liver cells). 12 4][15] During the earliest stage of liver organogenesis, endothelial cells promote hepatoblast migration and outline the liver bud before differentiating into functional blood vessels. 13,14 Differentiated LSECs are highly fenestrated and lack a basement membrane, and they act as gatekeepers, controlling bidirectional exchange between blood and hepatocytes. 12,16 LSECs can be divided into periportal LSECs that have fewer and larger fenestrae, and pericentral LSECs that have more and smaller fenestrae. 17 he structural differences of LSECs and changes in blood supply around birth confer functional heterogeneity to hepatic parenchymal cells. 18 Genomic and metabolic profiling data have revealed that hepatocytes are spatially organized in a compartmentalized manner, termed liver zonation, and can be divided into periportal, intermediate, and pericentral metabolic zones. 19,20 6][27] Proper liver zonation is related closely to the establishment and maintenance of liver metabolic function, especially lipid metabolism. 28,29 1][32][33] However, whether and how LSECs contribute to the establishment of lipid homeostasis remains largely unknown. \n\nLipid metabolism is one of the prominent metabolic functions of the liver. The underlying mechanisms breaking hepatic lipid homeostasis include decreased mitochondrial fatty acid b-oxidation, increased de novo lipogenesis, and enhanced uptake of fatty acids to the liver. 34,35 The excessive accumulation of lipid metabolites causes lipotoxicity and eventually induces liver injury. 36 Although the pathogenesis of fatty liver has received much attention over the past few decades, the primary study results are from adult animal models fed with a high-fat diet. 37,38 There still are large gaps in understanding the regulation of the transition from fetal liver to mature liver after birth.",

The incidence of NAFLD in patients with T2DM and patients with obesity ranges from 40 to 80% and from 30 to 90%, respectively [7]. More than 90% of people with severe obesity have NAFLD [8].\n\nIn addition to liver parenchymal cells, which play decisive roles, liver non-parenchymal cells can also affect the development of NAFLD. Liver non-parenchymal cells include hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), macrophages (Kupffer cells), pit cells, dendritic cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). During NAFLD, these cells may mediate liver inflammation and fibrosis due to long-term liver lipotoxicity and hepatocyte damage [9]. Kupffer cells are resident macrophages in the liver and include classic M1 type (pro-inflammatory) cells and alternative M2 type (anti-inflammatory) cells. A relative balance between M1 and M2 cells helps repair and reshape damaged liver tissue [10]. Palmitate promotes Kupffer cells to polarize to a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, while polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) increases anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage populations. Hepatic palmitate content generally increases during the progression of NAFLD, which leads to an imbalance in the M1/M2 type ratio and accelerates liver inflammation [11]. HSCs are distributed around the sinuses throughout the liver. Under normal circumstances, HSCs are at rest. However, when the liver is damaged by inflammation or mechanical stimulation, HSCs are activated and transformed into myofibroblastlike cells (MFCs) [12]. HSCs are the ultimate target cells for various fibrogenic factors. HSCs can also be activated in response to inflammation and hepatocyte damage caused by lipid accumulation or lipotoxicity during NAFLD [9,12]. Notably, LSECs are the most abundant non-parenchymal cells in the liver. Lipid accumulation during long-term NAFLD development causes LSEC lipotoxicity [9",

LSECs are characterized with numerous fenestrae and lack basement membrane as well as a diaphragm. These unique morphological characteristics of LSECs makes them the most permeable endothelial cells of the mammalian vasculature and aid in regulating flow of macromolecules and small lipid-based structures between sinusoidal blood and parenchymal cells. LSECs have a very high endocytic capacity aided by scavenger receptors (SR), such as SR-A, SR-B (SR-B1 and CD-36), SR-E (Lox-1 and mannose receptors), and SR-H (Stabilins). Other high-affinity receptors for mediating endocytosis include the Fc\u03b3RIIb, which assist in the antibody-mediated removal of immune complexes. Complemented with intense lysosomal activity, LSECs play a vital role in the uptake and degradation of many blood borne waste macromolecules and small (<280 nm) colloids. Currently, seven Toll-like receptors have been investigated in LSECs, which are involved in the recognition and clearance of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) as well as damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Along with other SRs, LSECs play an essential role in maintaining lipid homeostasis with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), in juxtaposition with hepatocytes. LSECs co-express two surface lectins called L-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3 Grabbing Non-integrin Receptor (L-SIGN) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin). LSECs also express several adhesion molecules which are involved in the recruitment of leukocytes at the site of inflammation. Here, we review these cell surface receptors as well as other components expressed by LSECs and their functions in the maintenance of liver homeostasis. We further discuss receptor expression and activity and dysregulation associated with the initiation",

Most research on aging in the liver has focused on hepatocytes and there is substantial literature on the Hallmarks of Aging and these cells. Moreover, many studies of the aging liver have used liver tissue which is primarily hepatocytes.

Here, the effects of aging all liver cell types are reviewed, then integrated in a unified model at the organ level.",

Expression of CD32B allows uptake of IgG immunocomplexes, while STAB2 is involved in endocytosis of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Finally, LSECs have a major role in adaptive immunity. LSECs are antigen-presenting cells through MR-mediated antigen uptake and expression of MHC-I 14 .\n\nUpon antigen presentation by MHC-I, LSECs can activate CD8+ T cells. In addition, LSECs are the main cells in the liver responsible for the conversion of CD4+ T cells into CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells 15 .\n\nIn pathological conditions, LSECs become dysfunctional and play a role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and fibrosis [16][17][18][19",

            "text": "Approximately 80% of the liver's volume is made up of hepatocytes, which are crucial in physiological processes, while 6.5% consists of non-parenchymal cells, like liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), cholangiocytes, and Kupffer cells. Minority cell populations support hepatocytes and maintain the hepatic environment. The liver's lobular structure promotes effective bidirectional intercellular communication and molecular information transfer through ECVs (Figure 2). For example, hepatocyte-derived ECVs carry arginase-1, which modulates endothelial cell function, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, which promotes liver regeneration. LSEC-derived ECVs modulate hepatic stellate cell activity, and HSC-derived ECVs may facilitate HCC progression. Cholangiocyte-derived ECVs affect bile acid homeostasis and promote healing. This encapsulates the varied currently known roles and cargo of hepatic-cell-derived ECVs in liver function and disease [93][94][95][96][97][98][99][100][101]. \n\nIn addition to playing a direct role in HCC, ECVs from hepatocytes and adipocytes carry specific cargoes that enhance steatosis and immune activation, driving the progression of chronic liver diseases like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease and ultimately increasing the downstream risk for HCC [102]. For example, hepatocytederived ECVs contain miRNAs such as miRNA-122, miRNA-192, and miRNA-128-3p, as well as mitochondrial DNA, influencing inflammation and metabolic dysregulation in non-alcoholic liver disease [103,104]. In alcoholic liver disease, hepatocyte-derived ECVs carry CD40 ligand and mitochondrial DNA, promoting inflammation and immune cell activation [105]. However, adipocyte-derived ECVs carry miRNA-99b target hepatocytes to promote steatosis [106].",

            "text": "Liver parenchymal cells are commonly implicated in hepatitis especially the HBV and other related diseases, whereas nonparenchymal cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells, 156 are closely associated with chronic liver conditions like liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. 157,158 The LNPs such as the 306Oi10 LNPs and PPZ-A10-based formulations, have been designed for simultaneous transfection of liver cells, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells. 159 The ionizable lipids were synthesized with a piperazine core and two tertiary amines. During screening, researchers discovered PPZ-A10, a lipid with shorter C10 carbon chains. They incorporated PPZ-A10, along with cholesterol, C18PEG2K, and DOPE, to create LNPs for efficient mRNA delivery to Kupffer cells. 160 Furthermore, a range of vector optimized strategies have been developed with the specific aim of improving the targeted delivery to liver parenchymal cells. A delivery vector designed by Finn et al. 161 achieved significant hepatic editing, with around 70% effectiveness at the mouse thyroxine transfer protein gene locus. This editing reached most hepatocytes in the mouse liver, including GS+ pericentral cells. 161 In another example, the reducible LNPs composed of disulfide bondcontaining hydrophobic tails have been screened for delivering Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) to hepatocytes to promote proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) knockdown. 162,163 There was a design of LNPs targeting the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) that enhanced mRNA expression in the liver, especially in RES cell types. 164 Such targeting approaches hold potential for ameliorating liver-related disorders by modulating specific cellular responses, thereby minimizing off-target effects and fostering therapeutic efficacy. \n\nUsing ligands to actively target delivery vectors to the liver and other organs of interest is a potential research area.",

            "text": "The liver represents an organ which shows a high passive accumulation for nanoparticles due to-(1) its high perfusion (25% of the cardiac output, while it constitutes only 2.5% of body weight) coupled with a high capacity to remove nutrients, metabolites and particulate material from the bloodstream (mainly via liver resident macrophages, that is, Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelia);\n\n(2) In line with the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in tumors, fenestrations in the sinusoidal capillaries allow for foreign particles up to a diameter of ~100 nm to be trapped in the space of Disse (between the sinusoidal endothelia and the hepatocytes, where HSC and Kupffer cells are located).Thus, even without specific targeting ligands, nanoparticles of appropriate size often come in close proximity to HSC, Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelia.This applies to lipoplexes of appropriate size and zeta potential and to nanohydrogel particles (NHPs) (Table 2) [116, [121][122][123].NHPs are well-defined nanocarriers that are suitable for delivery of small anionic molecules including siRNA.They consist of biocompatible amphiphilic co-block polymers with a covalently stabilized inner core [134].In the second generation of NHPs in vivo tolerance was improved by the introduction of an acid-labile core, yielding biodegradable (bio-)NHPs [121].After loading with siRNA, surface charge (zeta-potential) of the carriers was neutral, avoiding unspecific interactions with serum proteins.Anticol1a1 siRNA loaded NHPs as well as bio-NHPs (2 mg/kg siRNA) demonstrated a robust antifibrotic effect in CCl4 liver fibrotic mice, with a 50% reduction of liver collagen [121,122].After intravenous injection, near infrared-labeled carriers rapidly accumulated in the fibrotic livers, with a comparable cellular uptake in activated (a-SMA+) HSC and a lack of toxicity after repeating intravenous administration.",

            "text": "The liver (hepar, liver) is the largest digestive gland of a complex tubular structure in mammals. It has a redbrown color, an elastic consistency, a flattened convexconcave shape and a lobular structure. The main functional-morphological unit of the organ is the hepatic lobules, which, merging together, form a complex lobule. Liver lobules have various forms: oval, polyhedral, in the form of a multilateral prism wherein the central vein passes. From the central vein, the hepatic tubules radially extend, consisting of double-row hepatic cells of various sizes, having one or two nucleus. In addition to hepatocytes, connective tissue elements such as fibroblasts and sinusoidal cells play an important role in the structure of the organ: endothelial cells, star reticuloendothelial cells (Kupffer's cells), perisinusoid cells (lipocytes, Ito cells, vitamin A synthesized, granulosa (pit-cells) \uf05b5, 10, 16\uf05d. \n\nNumerous and important functions of the liver determine its importance as a vital organ. The liver is the main organ in the regulation of metabolism and maintaining the uniformity of the internal environment of the organism. The liver is one of the important target organs that respond quickly to the effects of exogenous and endogenous stimuli \uf05b3, 18\uf05d. \n\nTo our knowledge, in recent years, drugs with high level nanoparticles have been used in animal husbandry \uf05b8, 9, 14\uf05d. The application of nanoparticles leaves open the question of their effects on living organisms \uf05b2\uf05d. The authors' works show the potential danger of the destructive effects of nanoparticles on the mucous membranes of the digestive and respiratory systems \uf05b6, 21, 23\uf05d. The article by Jo D.H. shows the mechanism of nanoparticle penetration into the central nervous system along the nerve fibers from the olfactory epithelium of the retina \uf05b11\uf05d. \n\nHowever, some researchers have reported that nanoparticles do not have a toxic effect. Nanoparticles of a water solution of CdSe/ZnS, stabilized by cysteine, do not have a cytotoxic effect when they are absorbed by cells \uf05b19\uf05d.",

            "text": "The parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells in the liver microenvironment play a unique role in the pathology of liver fibrosis. The progression and regression of liver fibrosis rely on a complex interplay between the hepatocytes, LSECs, stellate cells, and Kupffer cells and the noncellular components of the fibrotic microenvironment [14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in fibrosis progression has a number of clinical implications, including the development of therapeutic interventions to impede or reverse hepatic fibrosis, some of which are already available [1,2,21]. \n\nThe high metabolic activity of the liver demands an efficient vasculature in the organ. The intricate network of capillaries of the liver is lined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), a specialized endothelial cell type that is phenotypically different from vascular endothelial cells [22]. LSECs are characterized by their unique morphological characteristics such as lack of a basement membrane in the endothelium and presence of open fenestrations [22]. These fenestrations are clustered throughout the cytoplasm to form dynamic sieve plates and facilitate the steric transport of cargo from the lumen (sinusoidal space) to the space of Disse and into the parenchyma [23]. The alterations in the diameter and frequency of fenestrations on LSECs are correlated with several liver injuries, toxins, and diseases and have implications in the loss of overall liver function [23,24]. LSECs also possess a characteristically high scavenger function for a diverse array of macromolecules. These cells contain a large number of endocytic vesicles that perform degradation and recycling of macromolecular wastes from lumen such as extracellular matrix breakdown, immune complexes, and lysosomal enzymes [25]. Additionally, LSECs play an active role in the immune regulation of the organ through bacterial processing, leukocyte adhesion, and viral clearance [26][27][28].",

            "text": "Notably, liver accumulation is known to correlate positively with particle size. This trend holds true for many classes of nanoparticles including AuNPs [270], SiNPs [271], and polymeric nanoparticles [272] Conversely, smaller nanoparticles (<5 nm) are typically excreted in the urine. In nearly all cases, coating nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) confers \"stealth\" properties for prolonged circulation and evasion of excretion. \n\nWith the successful launch of multiple LNP-delivered RNA drugs in the past few years, many have sought to modify LNP tropism to expand their therapeutic utility. For example, preferential organ accumulation of systemically administered ionizable LNPs can be modulated by the amount of cationic lipids used during formulation [172,173]. Moreover, differential delivery of RNA LNPs to cell types within the liver is also possible by adjusting the proportion of PEG-lipid [273]. Multiple reports have also demonstrated that both charge and size of LNPs affect their tropism and delivery to different immune cell subtypes [274]. \n\nFor bioinspired nanocarriers such as cell-derived exosomes, particle properties are less easily manipulated, as their composition is already defined at the time of harvesting. The protein and lipid composition of exosomes' outer membrane largely determines its specificity. Exosomes are preferentially taken up by target cells with similar membrane composition to the production cell. Thus, one strategy for targeting exosomes to the correct tissue is to isolate them from the same types of cells as the target.",

            "text": "Kupffer cells, the resident liver macrophages, have long been considered as scavenger cells responsible for removing particulate material from the portal circulation. However, evidence derived mostly from animal models indicates that Kupffer cells may be implicated in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases including viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, intrahepatic cholestasis, and activation or rejection of the liver during liver transplantation and liver fibrosis [117]. \n\nBoth the Kupffer and sinusoidal endothelial cells share many characteristics that can be relevant for the enhanced uptake of drug delivery systems by these cells. They are endowed with a high phagocytic capacity and are as such an intrinsic part of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This system plays an essential role in the regulation of the host defence system and because of this, many foreign particles that accumulate in these two cell types [118]. Several of these diseases are treated with systemic immunosuppressive agents, but there are many arguments that favour a local downregulation of inflammatory processes within the liver rather than inducing systemic immunosuppressive effects [119]. Accumulation of therapeutic compounds in Kupffer and endothelial cells can either be nonspecific or specific via designated receptors. Drug delivery systems like liposomes, micelles and viral particles end up in these cells via nonspecific uptake mechanisms due to their largest phagocytic activity [120]. \n\nIn addition, uptake in Kupffer and endothelial cells can also be mediated by specific receptors. These cells bind to negatively charged molecules via scavenger receptors that are abundantly expressed on their membrane [121,122]; for example, coupling of compound to lysine groups within the albumin molecule removes positive charges from the molecule which creates a compound with a net negative charge that may serve as a ligand for scavenger receptors [123,124]. \n\nTargeting to Kupffer cell is directed through mannose receptor using sugar moieties (like mannose and fucose) which are coupled to delivery system while targeting to sinusoidal endothelial cell is possible using hyaluron receptor as the target receptor [5,6].",

The pharmacokinetic and safety profile of fCNT in a non-human primate strongly proposes extrapolation to humans. The predominant hepatic cell type that accumulated this fibrillar nanocarbon was a professional scavenger endothelial cell in the sinusoid that performed rapidly and at high capacity. Mouse LSEC has 14 \u00b1 5 fenestrae per mm 2 (humans have 15-25 per mm 2 ) with diameters of 99\u00b118 nm (humans, 50odo300 nm) 36 . This is an avid, dedicated mammalian scavenger cell and in combination with intact biliary elimination of fCNT has yielded a very favourable biological outcome for soluble fibrillar nanocarbon in animal models. Biocompatibility has been confirmed in several model systems and now these results explain the action of the host on fCNT and add further weight to arguments for use in man. \n\nPotential therapeutic application of fCNT in humans could focus on the critical role of LSE in numerous liver disorders (for example, ischemia-reperfusion injury, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and pseudocapillarization in the aging population) 30 . fCNT could be envisioned as a molecular platform to specifically target the LSEC and deliver therapeutic interventions (for example, small molecule drugs or RNA interference) to treat LSEC-based disorders. Hepato-targeted gene therapy strategies are being explored 50,51 and fCNT could be included as a selective delivery platform based on our favourable pharmacokinetic and toxicologic data and the ability of fCNT to strongly bind, deliver and unload siRNA in vivo 52,53 . Macrophages that express Stabilin-1 (not liver-resident Kupffer cells) should accumulate fCNT via receptor-mediated processes and suggests further investigation 54 .

The authors believe that the next successful use of mRNA vaccines is to be expected because LNPs are widely used in nucleic acid delivery research and clinical applications, and nearly 80 kinds of nucleic acid drugs based on LNPs have entered the clinical stage. 30 Although some clinical data are still available after approval and emergency use authorization (EUA) are obtained from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), LNPs still have many problems that cannot be bypassed. There are several obstacles inside and outside the cells that prevent the application of mRNA LNPs within a wide range. Liver enrichment is a common phenomenon in the mouths of LNP patients. LNPs require some effort to pass through the liver system, and nanoparticles must first be isolated from Kupffer cells (which are macrophages resident in the liver). Kupffer cells in the liver can absorb LNPs of different sizes. In addition, LNPs also interact with hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) to prevent LNPs from passing through the liver system (Figure 2). 31 A total of 30\u221290% of these drugs are concentrated in the liver, which leads to drug deviation during nonliver-targeted administration, 32 thus affecting the therapeu-tic efficacy.",

            "text": "The liver is the largest abdominal organ, receiving its blood supply from two prominent sources: the hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein (Figure 2A,B). These blood vessels divide into finer capillaries and the liver sinusoids, ultimately leading to the lobules. The hepatocytes are a major cell population in the liver (~85%), providing primary sites for protein synthesis, metabolism, and detoxification [28]. Other important cell-types include hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells, all of which contribute to the maintenance of liver homeostasis. In case of chronic injury to the liver, these cells commence a crosstalk, leading to production of fibrous collagen and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling factors. Consequently, liver diseases, such as HCC, typically initiate from underlying inflammation and cause significant changes in the liver's extra-and intracellular pathophysiology, thus perturbing drug delivery. While normal liver tissues receive 80% of the blood supply from the hepatic portal vein, HCC is characterized by high perfusion from the hepatic artery. Therefore, low blood influx through the portal vein in HCC patients causes low nanoparticle penetration into the liver after systemic administration [29]. While the sinusoidal fenestrates are decreased, the nanoparticles must penetrate the endothelial barrier, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the tumor stromal barriers to reach the HCC cells [30]. Understanding the biological barrier of the tumor is critical for the judicious selection of plant bioactive compounds and designing a new generation of nanomedicines for HCC therapy. Recent advancements in molecular biology techniques, including microarrays and high-throughput screening, have greatly improved our knowledge about the tumor characteristics and molecular mechanisms of HCC [31,32]. The tumor microenvironment consists of tumoral and non-tumoral cells, such as hepatic stellate cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, cytotoxic T-cells, and tumor-associated macrophages.",

            "text": "The liver plays a central role in lipid metabolism, including de novo lipogenesis, lipolysis, \u03b2-oxidation, and secretion of lipoproteins such as very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) [15]. In physiological conditions, LSEC regulate bidirectional lipid exchange between the blood and the liver parenchyma, and thus play a crucial role in the maintenance of whole-body lipid homeostasis. This task is facilitated by the LSEC open fenestrae without organizing basement membranes, which enable macromolecules and lipoproteins to pass through the endothelial sieve from the sinusoidal lumen to the space of Disse, to be taken up by hepatocytes [16,17]. Hence, chylomicron remnants (triglyceride-depleted but cholesterol-and retinol-rich lipolytic products of chylomicrons), pass through the LSEC fenestrae, and are rapidly taken up by hepatocytes; whereas larger lipoproteins such as triglyceride-rich parent chylomicrons are prone to be trapped in the sinusoidal lumen [18][19][20]. Given that hepatocytes require triglycerides carried by chylomicron remnants for VLDL synthesis; this size-based selective trans-endothelial transport system mediated by LSEC fenestrae plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism under physiological conditions. Moreover, LSEC exhibit a high endocytic capacity, and contribute to the transfer of excess plasma lipids from the circulation to the liver parenchyma [21]. Li et al. reported that mildly oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in plasma is endocytosed by LSEC but not by Kupffer cells. This function of LSEC as a lipid scavenger is mainly mediated by the transmembrane receptor stabilin-1 on the LSEC surface [22] (Figure 2).",

            "text": "The number of NP-positive HSCs in the hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver was significantly highest among all NP-treated livers (Figure 5B), and so hydrophilic surface-modified NPs might be more likely to reach HSCs when compared with the hydrophobic surface-modified NPs. Besides the surface characteristic of NPs, their size is also a highly important factor affecting NP cellular distribution in the liver [32]. In the liver, NPs should penetrate LSECs to reach HSCs and hepatocytes. NPs mainly pass the LSECs through the fenestrae [32]. Generally, the size of LSEC fenestrae in mice varies between 50 and 280 nm [33], and therefore the NPs we used in the present study could be delivered to HSCs, as well as hepatocytes. However, it is thought that comparatively smaller-sized NPs would be more effective for delivery to HSCs and hepatocytes. Importantly, NPs greater than 280 nm may be highly specific to targeting Kupffer cells. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the ratio of NP-positive HSCs between hydrophobic-NP-PBS treated liver and hydrophobic-NP-olive oil treated liver. Thus, the NPs' size depends on the presence or absence of silica NP aggregation. In the absence of NP aggregation, NPs seem to pass the LSEC barrier easily via the fenestrae, due to the smaller size of the NPs relative to the fenestrae diameters. \n\nNP delivery to the HSCs has been one of the most important issues for the treatment of chronic liver fibrosis [34][35][36], a condition induced by the activation of HSCs and their transformation to a myofibroblast-producing collagen-rich extracellular matrix, resulting in severe disruption of the liver architecture. Kupffer cells, LSECs, and a collagenous extracellular matrix have been insurmountable obstacles for NP or drug delivery to HSCs to treat liver fibrosis, despite several studies on this issue [33].",

Cell proliferation is triggered by several growth factors and cytokines, such as HGF, TGF-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which activate their cognate receptors and, consequently, downstream signaling and transcription of the genes associated with cell cycle progression [52][53][54][55][56][57][58] . Among the signaling cascades mediating platelet effects on the process of liver regeneration, the most important are TNF-\u03b1/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), IL-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 STAT3, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. \n\nPrevious studies indicate that platelets can exert positive effects on liver regeneration through cooperation with LSECs and Kupffer cells, and direct interaction with hepatocytes. \n\nLSECs mostly consist of sinusoidal cells which, through formation of a continuous thin layer of the sinusoidal endothelium, create a structural barrier between the hepatic parenchyma and blood flowing through the liver [59,60] . LSECs play an important role in the maintenance of hepatic functions by providing exchange of nutrients between circulating blood and hepatocytes because of the presence of open pores beneath the endothelium [61] . In addition, LSECs secrete immunoregulatory cytokines, including HGF, IL-1, IL-6 and interferons, affecting liver regeneration. Thus, impact of platelet-Kupffer cell interaction in liver fibrosis. However, it is evident that the contact between platelets and Kupffer cells cause activation of both cells.",

            "text": "The aim of the present review is to give an outline of the blood clearance function of the mammalian liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which constitute one of the two cellular arms of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). It is generally accepted today that the hepatic RES consists of two types of specialized clearance cells, namely the liver macrophages, or Kupffer cells, that are geared to take up particles (>200 nm) via phagocytosis, and the non-phagocytic LSECs that are specially equipped for clearance of macromolecules and colloids by receptor-mediated endocytosis (Seternes et al., 2002). This understanding is the result of a scientific evolution that has taken place over more than a century, starting with the discovery of the macrophage (Metchnikoff, 1884(Metchnikoff, , 1968)), and the use of vital stains to locate the anatomical sites of uptake of blood-borne exogenous and endogenous waste material (Kiyono, 1914;Aschoff, 1924). Uptake of vital stains (a type of colloidal particles) occurred in so-called \"reticuloendothelial cells\" (Aschoff, 1924), which are endothelial cells with high scavenging activity (Seternes et al., 2002). Readers who wish to look deeper into the historical backdrops and the scientific evolution of the development of the RES concept are referred to Smedsr\u00f8d (2004) and S\u00f8rensen et al. (2012). \n\nA series of experiments during the 1980s established that soluble macromolecules and nanoparticles of various kinds were rapidly cleared from the circulation of mammals mainly by specialized endothelial cells in the liver sinusoids, with negligible uptake in the Kupffer cells (Smedsr\u00f8d et al., 1990b). Violating the paradigm at the time, that the Kupffer cells alone constituted the RES (Van Furth et al., 1972), these findings came as a surprise.",

            "text": "BackgroundNumerous studies in rats and a few other mammalian species, including man, have shown that the sinusoidal cells constitute an important part of liver function. In the pig, however, which is frequently used in studies on liver transplantation and liver failure models, our knowledge about the function of hepatic sinusoidal cells is scarce. We have explored the scavenger function of pig liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), a cell type that in other mammals performs vital elimination of an array of waste macromolecules from the circulation.Results125I-macromolecules known to be cleared in the rat via the scavenger and mannose receptors were rapidly removed from the pig circulation, 50% of the injected dose being removed within the first 2\u20135 min following injection. Fluorescently labeled microbeads (2 \u03bcm in diameter) used to probe phagocytosis accumulated in Kupffer cells only, whereas fluorescently labeled soluble macromolecular ligands for the mannose and scavenger receptors were sequestered only by LSEC. Desmin-positive stellate cells accumulated no probes. Isolation of liver cells using collagenase perfusion through the portal vein, followed by various centrifugation protocols to separate the different liver cell populations yielded 280 \u00d7 107 (range 50\u2013890 \u00d7 107) sinusoidal cells per liver (weight of liver 237.1 g (sd 43.6)). Use of specific anti-Kupffer cell- and anti-desmin antibodies, combined with endocytosis of fluorescently labeled macromolecular soluble ligands indicated that the LSEC fraction contained 62 \u00d7 107 (sd 12 \u00d7 107) purified LSEC. Cultured LSEC avidly endocytosed ligands for the mannose and scavenger receptors.ConclusionsWe show here for the first time that pig LSEC, similar to what has been found earlier in rat LSEC, represent an effective scavenger system for removal of macromolecular waste products from the circulation.",

            "text": "The present study determined hepatic cellular distribution of surface-modified silica NPs in mouse liver. Hydrophilic surface-modified NPs dispersed as small-sized particles in PBS (Figure 1B). NPs with hydrophobic surface modification dispersed in olive oil but tended to aggregate in PBS (Figure 1B). When those NPs were intraperitoneally injected, considerably more hydrophobic surface-modified NPs were delivered to the liver compared with hydrophilic surface-modified NPs. Hence, NP delivery to the liver can be improved by hydrophobic surface modification of silica NPs. It is believed that the hydrophobic surface condition may facilitate their absorption by the peritoneal tissues, due to the hydrophobicity of the parietal, visceral peritoneum, mesentery, and omentum covering the abdominal visceral organs [24]. \n\nIn mice, Kupffer cells have been deemed pivotal in removing NPs from the liver [25]. Consistent with this statement, we also observed that NP fluorescence intensity per cell was significantly higher in Kupffer cells than the other types of liver cells, such as LSECs, HSCs, and hepatocytes (Figure S1, Supplementary Materials). Those results can be explained by the cellular location and active phagocytic behavior of Kupffer cells [2]. Interestingly, hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface modification of silica NPs was not associated with NP distribution in Kupffer cells (Figure 3), suggesting that both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface modification of NPs are not helpful to target and evade Kupffer cells for drug delivery. However, Cheng et al. [26] demonstrated that hydrophobic mesoporous silica NPs were more rapidly removed from liver circulation by Kupffer cells compared with hydrophilic NPs, suggesting hydrophobic NPs rather than hydrophilic NPs were more easily taken up by Kupffer cells. In this study, we synthesized core-shell-type silica NPs and found no significant difference in the relative NP uptake ratio by Kupffer cells among all three types of NP-treated livers (Figure 8).",

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) help in maintaining hepatic homeostasis, but the contribution of age\u2010associated LSECs dysfunction to MASLD is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of aging\u2010associated LSECs dysfunction on MASLD. Free fatty acid\u2013treated AML12 cells were co\u2010cultured with young and etoposide\u2010induced senescent TSEC cells to evaluate the senescence\u2010associated endothelial effects on the lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. In addition, young and aged rats were subjected to methionine\u2010choline\u2010deficient diet\u2013induced metabolic dysfunction\u2013associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Hepatic hemodynamics and endothelial dysfunction were evaluated by in situ liver perfusion. Liver tissue samples from young and aged healthy controls and MASH patients were also analyzed. Steatotic AML12 cells co\u2010cultured with young TSEC cells showed less lipid accumulation, and such effect was abolished by eNOS inhibitor or with senescent TSEC cells. However, co\u2010culture with resveratrol\u2010treated senescent TSEC cells could partially resume the NO\u2010mediated protective effects of endothelial cells. Furthermore, aged MASH rats showed more severe liver injury, steatosis, fibrosis, and endothelial and microcirculatory dysfunction. In addition, aged MASH patients showed more pronounced liver injury and fibrosis with lower hepatic eNOS, p\u2010eNOS, and SIRT1 protein levels than in young patients. Senescence compromises the protective effects of LSECs against hepatocyte steatosis. In addition, aging aggravates not only liver steatosis and fibrosis but also intensifies LSECs dysfunction in MASH rats. Accordingly aged MASH patients also showed endothelial dysfunction with more severe liver injury and fibrosis.",

            "text": "However, mammalian liver contains various other cell types, referred to as non-parenchymal cells (NPC), which are essential for normal biologic and immunologic functions.These include liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs, which constitute the wall of the liver sinusoids), Kupffer cells (KCs) which are resident liver macrophages, stellate cells (HSCs) which are pericytes found in perisinusoidal space, liver-associated lymphocytes and dendritic cells.LSECs produce cytokines, activate CD4 + T cells and function as a barrier between leukocytes or other macromolecules present in the sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes [129][130][131].KCs, which are specialized machrophages, are located mainly in the periportal sinusoids so they can phagocytose and eliminate antigens and pathogens entering the liver parenchyme via venous blood from the intestines [125].The liver's immune tolerance is dependent on the autocrine and paracrine effects of cytokines secreted by KCs as well as on LPS stimulation of immune cells and antigen presenting cells (KC and LSECs particularly) [132].KCs and LSECs express cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), TGF\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and prostaglandins either constitutively or in response to LPS, resulting in downregulation of leukocyte adhesion to LSECs, expansion of regulatory T cells (T-regs) and abrogation of T cell activation, all of which lead to an increased immune tolerance in the liver [106,[133][134][135][136][137].\n\nElegant studies have been conducted to demonstrate that bypassing the liver's intrinsic immunity checkpoints leads to the development of IDILI.Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) are important immune checkpoint mediators which are involved in inducing hepatic immune tolerance [138].",

            "text": "The exposure and default accumulation of nanoparticles in the RES and MPS of the liver may expose hepatic tissues to delayed toxicity or result in chronic inflammation. Hepatocyte death and impairment in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), a major component of the RES, are often accompanied by features that herald the transformation from clinically benign obesity-related fatty liver, or steatosis, to the more serious non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [28][29][30][31]. Our results showed that PEG-AuNP led to hepatic inflammation at an earlier time point with an increase in monocytes and F4/80-positive Kupffer cells, which were rarely found in liver sections at 3 mos (Figure 4B), indicating that the inflammation induced by PEG-AuNPs gradually resolved after 1 mo. By using Masson trichrome (not shown) and Sirius Red staining, collagen deposition was highest at 1 mo after nanoparticle injection, predominantly in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. The collagen staining of sinusoids decreased at 3 mos compared to staining at 1 mo, suggesting that early increases in collagen at sinusoids were due to inflammation triggered by PEG-AuNPs. In contrast, the increased intensity of collagen dye in hepatocytes at 3 mos compared to 1 mo was likely due to a phenotype change in hepatocytes resulting in different protein/lipid composition that affected dye adsorption. \n\nWe observed an increase in total cholesterol in mice 3 mos after PEG-AuNP injection without induction of the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT. Liver enzyme activity, in particular of AST, was previously shown to not be specific to nanoparticle-induced injury [11]. Sustained liver inflammation and oxidative stress can lead to cholesterol dysregulation and hypercholesterolemia; therefore, more research is needed to address whether increased cholesterol caused by PEG-AuNPs in liver increases risk of liver steatosis. Several studies have addressed the involvement of various metal nanoparticles in liver steatosis [9].",

An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195]. In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1.

Therefore, an understanding of the factors required for the efficient, selective, and safe delivery of siRNA is a great challenge for successful siRNA delivery. Herein, we report on the development of two pH-sensitive cationic lipids and their use in examining the impact of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value, lipase sensitivity and the size of lipid nanoparticles on the biodistribution, and efficiency and cell specificity of gene silencing in the liver. An increase in the pKa value resulted in a significant change in the intrahepatic localization of siRNA and gene-silencing efficiency in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The sensitivity of the pH-sensitive cationic lipid to lipases was a major factor in achieving hepatocyte-specific gene silencing. Increasing the particle size can improve the LSEC specificity of gene silencing. As a consequence, we succeeded in developing both a highly efficient, hepatocyte-specific formulation, and the most efficacious LSEC-targeted formulation reported to date. These findings will facilitate the development of more sophisticated siRNA delivery systems.",

A similar intrahepatic distribution has recently been described for LNP-DNA barcode systems (composed of MC3 or cKK-E12) by Sago et al. [50]. However, direct comparison of datasets carried out with different LNP systems, including variations in the lipid composition, ionizable lipid, lipid-nucleic acid ratios, and nucleic acid type must be assessed with caution. At a dose of 0.3 mg DNA /kg, LNPs accumulated in all three major liver cell types, with higher doses in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes than endothelial cells. In sharp contrast, gene expression following LNP-mediated mRNA delivery demonstrated an inverse hierarchy among hepatic cells: endothelial cells > Kupffer cells > hepatocytes. Higher LNP doses corresponding to 1 mg/kg mRNA shifted expression slightly towards hepatocytes while keeping the same pattern. Transfection of all major liver cell types with equal potency was recently demonstrated for LNP-mRNA systems (composed of branched-tail 306O i10 ) at a dose of 2 mg RNA/kg by Hajj et al. [51].\n\nIndeed, targeting the right cell type with the right dose is crucial to developing effective therapeutics. It should be noted that the LNP compositions described in these preclinical studies deviate from those used in the clinic (except for MC3-based LNPs). Systematic studies are therefore needed to improve our fundamental understanding of LNPs' in vivo behavior. Rigorous control of physicochemical LNP characteristics such as size distribution, zeta potential, and entrapment will be crucial to assess the intrahepatic distribution of a single LNP composition with different payloads.",

For example, lipid compositions can shift the protein corona abundance away from ApoE, which is a recognized driver of hepatocyte LNP uptake and transfection [191].\n\nKnowing that lipid nanoparticles can be directed to the pulmonary endothelium by introducing cationic lipids in their formulation established one of the first rational design strategies to target endothelial cells. This finding could accelerate the production of targeted nanoparticles to the endothelium, as most nanoparticles generated prior to this discovery were fabricated with lipids obtained from tedious library screens or novel chemical synthesis. Coincidentally, most lipids generated through those approaches turned out to be cationic. AtuFECT01, for example, is a cationic lipid that was derived from a novel chemical synthesis that was used to formulate nanoparticles with siRNA to knockdown genes of endothelial cells [179]. The nanoparticles made with the AtuFECT01 lipid were capable of transfecting endothelial cells in various organs, including the lung, heart, and liver [179]. These nanoparticles were later optimized to become selective to pulmonary endothelial cells by increasing the amount of AtuFECT01 lipid and introducing cholesterol in their formulation [122].\n\nAnother cationic lipid that was derived from a library screen and used in the formulation of siRNA containing nanoparticles to target endothelial cells is 7C1 [121,175]. This lipid, which was obtained from the conjugation of alkyl chains to low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI), formed nanoparticles that were highly selective for endothelial cells of mice and non-human primates, and was capable of transfecting the endothelium of various organs, including the lung where they had the highest transfection efficiency [121,175].

(2017); Zapotoczny, Szafranska, Kus et al. (2017)]. LSECs mediate the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, lipids, and proteins between hepatic sinusoids and hepatocytes through small fenestrae. These fenestrae are non-diaphragmed pores with a diameter of 50-150 nm and organized in clusters termed sieve plates [Yamasaki, Ikeda, Nakatani et al. (1999); Poisson, Lemoinne, Boulanger et al. (2017)]. Liver injury can cause LSECs to lose their fenestrae and large gaps (0.3-2 \u03bcm) formation, which mainly promotes the interactions between LSECs and circulating leukocytes or tumor cells under biochemical and biomechanical stimuli [Braet, Shleper, Paizi et al. (2004) ;Ito, Abril, Bethea et al. (2006); Sanabria and Dong (2018)]. LSECs also serve as an important barrier in the innate immune responses, providing the first line of defense against intestinal pathogens and toxins. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte (neutrophil, PMN) recruitment in the liver sinusoids is widely observed in almost all liver diseases and contributes to pathogen clearance or tissue damage [Ramaiah and Jaeschke (2007); Heymann and Tacke (2016)]. PMN accumulation within sinusoids and their extravasation into the parenchyma is controlled by a series of adhesion molecules expressed on the surface of PMNs and LSECs.",

Lalor 1,2 and David H. Adams 1,2 * Abstract | Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) line the low shear, sinusoidal capillary channels of the liver and are the most abundant non-parenchymal hepatic cell population. LSECs do not simply form a barrier within the hepatic sinusoids but have vital physiological and immunological functions, including filtration, endocytosis, antigen presentation and leukocyte recruitment. Reflecting these multifunctional properties, LSECs display unique structural and phenotypic features that differentiate them from the capillary endothelium present within other organs. It is now clear that LSECs have a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis within the liver and in mediating the immune response during acute and chronic liver injury. In this Review , we outline how LSECs influence the immune microenvironment within the liver and discuss their contribution to immune-mediated liver diseases and the complications of fibrosis and carcinogenesis. \n\nfenestrations lack a diaphragm or basal lamina and are grouped into organized sieve plates, rendering LSECs highly permeable (Fig. 1d). Many studies have implicated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as an essential factor for regulation of fenestrations 21 , but dynamic changes in hepatic fenestration number and size can occur rapidly in response to agents such as alcohol 22 , diet ary constituents 23 and fasting 24 or calorie restriction 25 . The fenestrations act as a 'dynamic filter' (reF. 26 ) to permit the access of macromolecules to parenchymal cells, and in addition, these pores might allow circulating viruses to gain access to hepatocytes 27 .",

            "text": "Most of the liver is composed of hepatocytes and occupies 78% of the parenchymal volume, while the non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) account for 6% of the volume. The extracellular space, including sinusoidal lumen, space of Disse, and biliary canaliculi together occupy the remaining 16% [29]. NPCs of the liver include the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), dendritic cells (DCs), and intrahepatic lymphocytes [28,29]. Finally, the liver is constantly exposed to gut-derived pathogens and antigen metabolic byproducts which is evident from high levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the portal system. DCs, KCs, and LSECs expressing toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) as part of their innate defense from foreign pathogens. In response to TLR stimulation due to constant exposure to low levels of LPS, these cells release anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. This phenomenon is known as LPS tolerance and TLR signaling plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between immune activation and tolerance [32]. This concept of tolerance is maintained by sinusoidal APCs-LSECS, KCs, and DC-and implies that the intravascular compartment of the liver is an anatomical structure that supports the deliberate induction of tolerance [33]. This could further explain the discrepancy between the inherent tolerogenicity of the whole liver versus isolated hepatocytes and the contribution of sinusoidal APCs to liver tolerance [34]. These mechanisms of NPC and immune cell roles in liver tolerance are under investigation; [8] some of their mechanisms are presented below.",

The liver is comprised primarily of hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelium (LSEC), stellate cells, bile duct epithelium and vascular endothelium. Mapping the cytotopographic distribution and hepatic processing of functionalized nanotubes is required for understanding their fate in vivo. These data will, in turn, inform on the optimal applications and possible toxicities of these unique materials with wider import for nanomedicine as a whole. \n\nThis paper reports several novel and unexpected details of hepatic processing of covalently functionalized nanotubes including receptor-mediated endocytosis, cellular trafficking and biliary elimination. First, water-soluble ammonium-functionalized fibrillar nanocarbon is found to preferentially localize in the fenestrated sinusoidal endothelium of the liver but not hepatocytes or resident macrophages. Second, both scavenger Stabilin receptors mediate the endocytic clearance of nanotubes. This particular receptor specificity for nanocarbon leads us to find that lymph tissue also accumulates carbon nanotubes. Third, we propose a mechanism for the hepatobiliary elimination of nanocarbon. Fourth, biocompatibility is evidenced by the absence of cell death and no immune cell infiltration. Towards clinical application of this platform, nanotubes were evaluated for the first time in nonhuman primates. The pharmacologic profile in cynomolgus monkeys is equivalent to what was reported in mice and suggests that nanotubes should behave similarly in humans.",

For instance, Kamei et al. developed a liver-on-a-chip platform using mature and functional hepatocyte-like cells derived from hPSCs [98], to create a 3D culture environment in which hepatocyte-like cells exhibited increased expression of hepatic maturation markers and cytochrome P450. The improved cultivation conditions led to a significantly elevated drug uptake/excretion capabilities above 90%, thus, highlighting the benefits of using human iPSC-derived hepatocytes as a substitute for immortalized as well as primary hepatocytes in drug screening and chemical safety testing. To model alcoholic liver disease, Deng et al. simulated liver sinusoid function by co-culturing HepG2 hepatocytes with LX-2 stellate cells, EAhy926 endothelial cells, and U937-derived Kupffer cells in a multi-layered double-membrane liver-on-a-chip system that displayed improved viability and increased urea and albumin levels [99]. The authors also demonstrated that exposure to alcohol damages the tight junctions of hepatocytes, reduces the release of NO of endothelial cells, and stimulates stellate cell proliferation. A similar study confirmed the validity of this complex on-chip co-culture model by using human primary hepatocytes instead of cell lines [100]. Another example of the on-chip co-culture system includes primary human hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) with stellate and Kupffer cells. Here, Li et al. investigated the role of zonation in hepatic physiology, hepatotoxicity, and progression of liver diseases using their liver acinus model. The endothelial compartment lined with human LSECs recapitulated immunologic functions within the liver sinusoid and promoted polymorphonuclear leukocytes' adhesion and transmigration upon activation. Furthermore, zonation-specific differential oxygen gradients lowered hepatic mitochondrial activity and hepatic steatosis but triggered",

Recent studies suggest that contributions of NPCs are vital, particularly in disease conditions and outcomes of drugs and their metabolites. Along with hepatocytes, NPCs\u2013Kupffer (KC), sinusoidal endothelial (LSEC) and stellate cells (SC) are major cellular components of the liver. Incorporation of primary cells in in vitro liver platforms is essential to emulate the functions of the liver and its overall response.

Our results indicate that the presence and contributions of multiple cells within the co-culture capture the interactions between hepatocytes and NPC and modulates the responses to inflammatory stimulus such as LPS.

The presence of NMs in the blood will result in the materials reaching the liver faster and in large quantities and will cause the induction of an immune response from the organ [12][13][14][15].\n\nThe liver has a crucial role in metabolic homeostasis. It is responsible for the storage, synthesis, metabolism and/or redistribution of carbohydrates and fats [16]. The organ produces large numbers of serum proteins, an array of enzymes and acute phase proteins. It is also the principal detoxification centre of the body, removing foreign substances and waste products [16]. The liver is characterised by its distinct populations of cells, each with their own unique morphology amongst which the hepatocytes, the resident macrophage population (Kupffer cells -KCs) and sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) being of utmost importance due to their numbers, location within a healthy liver and the wide arrays of functions that are crucial in overall liver activity [13,14,[16][17][18][19].\n\nIt is widely argued that in vitro hepatocyte systems (including cell lines and systems without optimal artificial extracellular matrices) might not be ideal for functional and metabolic studies as the cells lose key liver specific functions especially their cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activity [18,20,21]. Hence the cells used in such experiments are not representative of \"real\" hepatocytes in vivo. In addition, most hepatic studies of the effects of nanomaterials are undertaken on hepatocyte cell lines or primary cultures lacking any non-parenchymal cells. However these cells are extremely important as they are components of the reticulo-endothelial system and are involved in the clearance of particles from blood as well as being crucial in the initiation of an immune response to foreign material challenge. Finally, in typical in vitro or ex-vivo systems cells have a very limited life span, therefore the opportunity for repeated exposure is not usually possible. To address all above issues for the very first time in a study of its kind we have utilized the InSphero 3D human liver microtissue model generated from primary human hepatocytes and liver-derived non-par",

            "text": "These mammalian endothelial cells are unique since they characteristically have non-diaphragmed fenestrae and lack basement membranes. This characteristic morphology of LSEC allows free bi-directional transfer of solutes between sinusoidal blood and hepatocytes. Furthermore, this also helps in the interaction of immune cells with hepatocytes. Unlike other endothelial cells, they have high endocytic capacity. LSECs represent one of the most actively endocytosing cell types in the body. LSECs are the initial target of injury for some hepatotoxic drugs and toxins and are susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury. They mediate clearance of soluble waste macromolecules and colloid material, including blood-borne adenovirus. 12 epatic stellate cells (HSCs) also known as perisinusoidal cells or Ito cells. These cells represent 5-8% of all liver cells and 13% of sinusoidal cells. HSCs are pericytes of the liver in the space between the parenchymal cells and the sinusoidal endothelial cells of the hepatic lobule. Pericytes are unique contractile cells that wrap around the endothelial cells of capillaries and venules throughout the body. Pericytes are embedded in the basement membrane from where they communicate with endothelial cells of the body's smallest blood vessels by means of both direct physical contact and paracrine signalling. Under physiological conditions, HSCs are involved in the storage of vitamin A, synthesis of extracellular matrices (ECM), matrixdegrading metalloproteinases and regulation of sinusoidal blood flow. In pathological conditions, when HSCs get activated, they lose their lipid-rich granules and transdifferentiate into \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)positive myofibroblasts. This leads to increased formation of ECM and proinflammatory as well as profibrogenic cytokines, thus causing liver fibrosis. 13",

More than 90% of people with severe obesity have NAFLD [8]. \n\nIn addition to liver parenchymal cells, which play decisive roles, liver non-parenchymal cells can also affect the development of NAFLD. Liver non-parenchymal cells include hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), macrophages (Kupffer cells), pit cells, dendritic cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). During NAFLD, these cells may mediate liver inflammation and fibrosis due to long-term liver lipotoxicity and hepatocyte damage [9]. Kupffer cells are resident macrophages in the liver and include classic M1 type (pro-inflammatory) cells and alternative M2 type (anti-inflammatory) cells. A relative balance between M1 and M2 cells helps repair and reshape damaged liver tissue [10]. Palmitate promotes Kupffer cells to polarize to a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, while polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) increases anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage populations. Hepatic palmitate content generally increases during the progression of NAFLD, which leads to an imbalance in the M1/M2 type ratio and accelerates liver inflammation [11]. HSCs are distributed around the sinuses throughout the liver. Under normal circumstances, HSCs are at rest. However, when the liver is damaged by inflammation or mechanical stimulation, HSCs are activated and transformed into myofibroblastlike cells (MFCs) [12]. HSCs are the ultimate target cells for various fibrogenic factors. HSCs can also be activated in response to inflammation and hepatocyte damage caused by lipid accumulation or lipotoxicity during NAFLD [9,12]. Notably, LSECs are the most abundant non-parenchymal cells in the liver.",

In the livers of EDTA-liposome-injected mice, engorged Kupffer cells exhibiting the same kind of vacuolar areas containing liposomes as found at earlier times bulge into the sinusoidal lumen. At 12 h, the Kupffer cell cytoplasm also shows an increase in lysosomes and residual bodies. The hepatocytes show no differences in structure from earlier times. \n\nThe liver examined 24 h after injection of the mice with EDTA-liposomes shows the first morphological change in the hepatocytes. There are large patches of autophagic vacuoles with increased numbers of lysosome-like dense bodies (Fig. 13).",

Apart from the above-mentioned methods, the use of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles (1-20 nm) for the treatment of NAFLD has also emerged as an area of great interest [193]. An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195]. In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1. \n\nTable 1.

            "text": "The liver consists of parenchymal cells (such as hepatocytes and cholangiocytes), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and a complex immune cell network built by myeloid and lymphoid cell populations (Figure 1). Sinusoids are lined by LSECs and provide docking sites for immune cells (6). HSCs in the space of Diss\u00e9 can regulate the blood flow (7) and represent the main reservoir of vitamin A (8,9). Hepatocytes carry out complex metabolic functions and secrete the bile on their basolateral surface into the bile canaliculi (10). Nutrients and molecules from the blood can reach hepatocytes via the fenestrated layer of LSECs containing oval pores approximately 50-150 nm in diameter (11,12). Additionally, LSECs are able to trancytose bloodderived materials directly to hepatocytes (12,13). To assure that hepatocytes can perform their metabolic function, the liver receives nearly 25% of the cardiac output (4). Besides its large blood flow, the liver produces between 25 and 50% of the total lymph arriving in the thoracic duct (14,15). Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) lining the lymphatics can be mainly found in the portal area (15) and provide important transport route for immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and memory T-cells (16) (Figure 1D).\n\nMost antigens in the liver are taken up and processed by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as DCs, Kupffer cells (KCs), or monocyte-derived myeloid cells (17). These cells are important milestones in generating liver-protective immunity as well as tolerance and have been recently discussed elsewhere (17,18). In this review, we will summarize the antigen presentation and its consequences by non-professional APCs in the liver.",

Besides that, adenovirus with the endothelial cell specific ROBO4 promoter have been seen to present a high degree of LSEC specificity and have been used to promote liver regeneration while bypassing fibrosis [218]. Finally, quantum dots (QDs), a type of nanoparticles with a size between 1-20 nm that present quantum effects [265] are also an area or interest [265]. Telluride/cadmium sulphide QDs [273] and Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs have been shown to effectively ameliorate LSEC delivery [274]. However, QDs may produce toxicity as they usually contain cadmium or other toxic elements [274]. \n\nBesides nanoparticle coating, particle size has to be taken into account since nanoparticles bigger than 250 nm are directly taken up by KC for being too big to pass through fenestrae. Contrarily, those with a diameter between 5-20nm particularly target LSEC [265,275]. \n\nFor the moment, LSEC targeting strategies have been employed in the context of cancer, autoimmunity, acute liver damage, ischemia-reperfusion injury and haemophilia [5,262,264,270,272,276], but they represent an attractive treatment also for liver fibrosis. \n\nIn fact, LSEC targeted delivery of drugs would represent an exceptional approach to specifically treat dysfunctional LSEC by selectively modifying their dysregulated pathways.",

            "text": "Background & Aims Liver cells are key players in innate immunity. Thus, studying primary isolated liver cells is necessary for determining their role in liver physiology and pathophysiology. In particular, the quantity and quality of isolated cells are crucial to their function. Our aim was to isolate a large quantity of high-quality human parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells from a single liver specimen. Methods Hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and stellate cells were isolated from liver tissues by collagenase perfusion in combination with low-speed centrifugation, density gradient centrifugation, and magnetic-activated cell sorting. The purity and functionality of cultured cell populations were controlled by determining their morphology, discriminative cell marker expression, and functional activity. Results Cell preparation yielded the following cell counts per gram of liver tissue: 2.0\u00b10.4\u00d7107 hepatocytes, 1.8\u00b10.5\u00d7106 Kupffer cells, 4.3\u00b11.9\u00d7105 liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and 3.2\u00b10.5\u00d7105 stellate cells. Hepatocytes were identified by albumin (95.5\u00b11.7%) and exhibited time-dependent activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Kupffer cells expressed CD68 (94.5\u00b11.2%) and exhibited phagocytic activity, as determined with 1\u03bcm latex beads. Endothelial cells were CD146+ (97.8\u00b11.1%) and exhibited efficient uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein. Hepatic stellate cells were identified by the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (97.1\u00b11.5%). These cells further exhibited retinol (vitamin A)-mediated autofluorescence. Conclusions Our isolation procedure for primary parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells resulted in cell populations of high purity and quality, with retained physiological functionality in vitro. Thus, this system may provide a valuable tool for determining liver function and disease.",

            "text": "However, that study focused on the neovascularization of retinas and pancreatic tumors while our analysis focused on the liver sinusoids, which are unique vessels lined by a unique endothelial cell population with both vascular and lymphatic features. LSECs differ from other endothelial cells both morphologically and functionally [40,41], and their lymphatic features suggest a potential role for EIIIA-cFN, which plays an important role in lymphatic development. Our system differs from previously studied models in other important ways. In the PHx model of injury, EIIIA-cFN but not EIIIB-cFN is upregulated early [31], suggesting that there is no compensatory increase in EIIIB-cFN. Additionally, we observed in this study and in a previous study of liver fibrosis [16] in EIIIA-cFN null mice that there are differences between males and females, which has not been observed in other studies of EIIIA-cFN and the vasculature. Thus, there are several reasons to believe that EIIIA-cFN may have a distinct role in the liver. \n\nThe finding that female EIIIA-cFN null mice have decreased accumulation of lipids and defects in sinusoidal repair raises an important question about the relationship between the integrity of the sinusoids and the efficient uptake of fatty acids. Mobilization of peripheral lipid stores and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes play a key role in providing energy for regeneration [33,34], but little is known about the role of the sinusoidal endothelium in transporting fatty acids to hepatocytes. In the heart, lipoprotein lipase is positioned at the luminal surface of endothelial cells and is required for delivery of lipids across the endothelium to cardiomyocytes [42]. Lipoprotein lipase is likewise on the luminal surface of the capillary endothelium [43], where it may play a similar role. We hypothesize that reduced adhesion of LSECs results in a reduction (although not complete loss) of effective lipid transport.",

            "text": "We propose to \"keep the liver busy\" by sequentially administering (i) a nanoprimer designed to physically and transiently saturate the Kupffer cells and (ii) a nanomedicine product (Fig. 2). The nanoprimer aims at priming the body to limit the capture of the nanomedicine product by the Kupffer cells. The expected outcomes are twofold: enhanced useful dose: the diminution of the nanomedicine product clearance by the MPS will enhance its blood bioavailability with an expected increase in treatment efficacy; decreased useless dose: correspondingly for a similar efficacy, the treatment toxicity could be reduced (and therefore adverse events more easily managed). Bioavailability raise using RES blockade has already been described by different approaches such as macrophage depletion with chlodronate loaded liposomes 26 or pre-dosing of the liver with empty DDS 27 . An article from Liu et al. 28 presents a correlation between liver saturation and increased treatment benefit/risk ratio using commercial empty liposomes presenting a broad size distribution (e. g. between 0,3 and 3 \u00b5m; phosphatidyl choline/cholesterol composition leading to low negative charge surface). These results are promising but it has been shown that biodistribution could be orientated by tuning physico-chemical attributes of the nanoparticles: as example size below 200 nm would increase hepatic accumulation compared to nanoparticles larger than 200 nm showing splenic accumulation, and highly negative surface charge would enhance macrophages internalization compared to neutral nanoparticles 29,30 . Our approach is focused on hepatic saturation since liver contains 80% of endogenous macrophages. This implies that the design of nanoprimer physico-chemical attributes must take into account the specificity of hepatic structures to maximize nanoprimer hepatic accumulation and interaction with Kupffer cells. Required physico-chemical attributes are listed in Table 1. Typically the size should be in the range 100-200 nm in order to avoid diffusion through Disse's space of sinusoidal capillaries 31 and limit splenic accumulation.",

When delivered IV, the Polypeptide Nanoparticle (PNP) was previously shown to go to cells in the liver (Supplemental Materials-Figure S1 f). We performed studies to determine the cells within the liver that take up the siRNA (described in Supplemental Materials). At 1h post transfection, the majority of the PNP, containing a fluorescent labeled siRNA, were located in Kupffer cells (KCs) and Liver Sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) (Figure 1 ). The LSECs showed significant Cy3-siRNA uptake at 2-4 h after HKP(+H)-siRNA complex injection. Approximately 40% of LSECs exhibit Cy3-siRNA uptake at 2 h, and the frequency decreased to 20% at 4 h. The Cy3 fluorescence returns to baseline 24 h after drug injection. The result indicates that HKP(+H)-siRNA complex may target 20-40% of LSECs. The KCs showed significant Cy3-siRNA uptake at 2-4 h after HKP(+H)-siRNA complex injection. Similar to LSECs, the Cy3 fluorescence in KCs returns to baseline 24 h after drug injection. The result indicates the HKP (+H)-siRNA complex may target 50-55% of KCs. The Periventricular Macrophages (PVMs) showed significant Cy3-siRNA uptake at 2-4 h. The result indicates that HKP (+H)-siRNA complex may target 20-40% of PVMs. Further details of the discrimination of liver cells and quantitation of Cy3 siRNA uptake is available in the supplementary materials. \n\nIn the cell sorting experiment, the hepatic stellate cells (HSC) represented a very low percentage of the overall cell population within the liver and the signal within these cells for the fluorescent labeled siRNA was too low to quantify additional changes. We therefore examined the effect of transfection on primary human hepatic stellate cells independently (Figure 2 A).",

            "text": "The liver has a central role in host defense [1,2]. Its extensive capillary network, the sinusoids, houses the body's most effective scavenger cell system comprising the Kupffer cells (KCs; the body's largest reservoir of resident macrophages [3]), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). For decades KCs, facing the sinusoidal lumen, were believed to be the only liver cell responsible for the clearance of blood-borne material [4,5]. This view was challenged by a series of studies throughout the 1980s and 1990s showing that a number of physiological macromolecules and colloids were cleared chiefly by LSECs, but only to a minor extent by KCs [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. Today it is accepted that LSECs and KCs together make up the hepatic \"dual cell principle of waste clearance\", with LSECs being geared to effective clathrin-mediated endocytosis of nanoparticles (< 200 nm), colloids, and macromolecules, and KCs taking up larger material [5]. The discovery that these cells share the task of blood clearance in this way suggested that LSECs are a highly specialized endothelium with characteristics in common with KCs, not only functionally, but at the molecular level as well. The present study was undertaken to study the similarities and differences of the two cells, by comparing their transcriptomes and proteomes. \n\nThe liver receives approximately 25% of cardiac output, exposing the sinusoidal cells to large volumes of blood, thus placing these cells in a unique position to monitor blood content. Approximately 80% of the organ blood supply drains the gut and contains (in addition to nutrients) toxins, bacterial components, viruses, and various waste products that are efficiently removed from blood by uptake in LSECs and KCs [5,15], thus preventing deposition and deleterious effects of such components elsewhere.",

            "text": "Apart from the above-mentioned methods, the use of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles (1-20 nm) for the treatment of NAFLD has also emerged as an area of great interest [193]. An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195]. In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1. muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression [190]. Moreover, lipid NPs carrying procollagen \u03b1 I(I) siRNA remarkably reduced the total hepatic collagen content, leading to an alleviation of NASH progression and accelerating the regression of hepatic fibrosis in CCL4-induced NASH in Balb/c mice [191]. In another attempt, CXCR4-targeted lipid-based NPs carrying VEGF siRNA were used for the treatment of liver fibrosis and hepatic cellular carcinoma; a combination therapy using both AMD-NPs (CXCR4 inhibitor) and VEGF siRNA abolished the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages and reduced HCC tumor growth [192].",

            "text": "The liver is the largest organ in the body but this large size and high blood flow (945 \u00b1 242 ml/min) in mice alone cannot explain the high distribution (Gjedde & Gjeode, 1980;Hui et al., 1994). The liver is a major clearance organ for many substances containing a population of resident macrophages called Kupffer cells, which in mice can be identified by the F4/80 marker. Several studies suggest that EVs are taken up predominantly by Kupffer cells although both small-and large-EVs are also taken up by hepatocytes and other cells in the liver (Bala et al., 2015;Imai et al., 2015;Tamura et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018;Willekens et al., 2005). \n\nCurrent evidence suggests that scavenger receptors, which are particularly abundant on Kupffer cells, are the key players involved in EV uptake. Scavenger receptors can bind to numerous ligands to promote removal of non-self or altered-self targets including phosphatidyl serine (PS) which is enriched in the membrane of many EVs (Llorente et al., 2013;Prabhudas et al., 2017). Several groups have elegantly demonstrated the role of scavenger receptors by pre-injecting animals with blocking ligands, including negatively charged PS-rich liposomes or poly-inosinic acid (poly-I), prior to IV administration of large-EVs. In those experiments, EVs showed slower clearance from the blood and significantly reduced liver localization. In contrast, phosphatidylcholine-rich liposome, which are not negatively charged had no effect on EV localization to the liver (Matsumoto et al., 2017;Willekens et al., 2005). The role of the negative charge in this localization is reinforced by the finding that negatively, but not positively charged non-biological nanoparticles are rapidly taken up by Kupffer cells in the liver (Cheng et al., 2012).",

Since non-parenchymal cells are exposed to these same signaling molecules, it seems likely that non-parenchymal cells also display a zonal distribution. Until recently, zonation of non-parenchymal cells was a largely unexplored area, but technological advancements that allowed for spatial detection of individual cell types greatly improved insight into this topic, as elaborated on further below. \n\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) form the bridge between hepatocytes and the sinusoid. LSECs also secrete Wnt factors that are sensed by hepatocytes. Wnt9b is expressed in LSECs throughout all liver zones while Wnt2b is expressed selectively by pericentral LSECs, resulting in a Wnt gradient with pericentral enrichment. 36,37 upffer cells are specialized resident macrophages in the liver sinusoid. Gut-derived bacterial products and xenobiotics enter the liver in the periportal zone where they are sensed by LSECs, resulting in a chemokine gradient to attract Kupffer cells. 38 Consequently, Kupffer cells are most abundant in the periportal area 39 likely to provide the first-line defense to pathogens and xenobiotics. Kupffer cells also play a role in regeneration of zonation after acute liver injury. 40 In MASLD, Kupffer cells are replaced with infiltrating monocytes derived from the bone marrow called hepatic lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) that have a transcriptome that is distinct from Kupffer cells and associated with MASLD progression. 41 nlike Kupffer cells that concentrate periportally, LAMs migrate toward the zones of lipid buildup. 39 epatic stellate cells (HSCs) reside in the space of Disse, which separates hepatocytes from LSECs. HSCs store vitamin A and produce constituents of the extracellular matrix.",

            "text": "The liver is a specific immunological and anatomical site in which blood is perfused through a network of sinusoids. Different zones of the liver are responsible for different functions. Blood antigens in the liver can be scanned by antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes. The liver as a multicellular structure has four lobes which are subdivided into hexagonal-shaped lobules (Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006;Thompson and Takebe, 2021). The liver is a major organ for immune defense and metabolism. Studies have elucidated that many nanoparticles prefer to accumulate in the liver. Although they can participate in the treatment of liver diseases such as liver fibrosis, viral hepatitis, and liver cell carcinoma, however, they can also cause liver injury. Their hepatotoxicity effects depend on the size, charge, dose, and modification of the MSNs. An increasing number of studies have found that nanomaterials can trigger the immune system and elevate ROS levels, leading to liver damage. Kupffer cells (KCs) as specialized macrophages have an important role in the clearance of substances such as MSNs, gutderived bacteria, and bacterial toxins. Autophagy is a critical dynamic intracellular process for cell hemostasis and often has a protective role in the liver. Impaired autophagy in KCs exacerbates liver injury in diseases like liver fibrosis, toxin-induced liver injury, and alcoholic liver disease (Zhu et al., 2017).\n\nHerein, we provide an overview of different molecular mechanisms involved in the hepatotoxicity of MSNs as well as available data on their liver toxicity in cell cultures, animal models, and at last, present data from available clinical studies. A schematic view of the main pathways involved in the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of MSNs is depicted in Figure 1.\n\nMSN can induce oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and liver injury. Activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB and JAK2/ STAT3 signaling, suppression of the Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 pathway, pyroptosis, and autophagy are involved in MSN",

            "text": "The liver plays a central role in lipid metabolism, including de novo lipogenesis, lipolysis, \u03b2oxidation, and secretion of lipoproteins such as very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) [15]. In physiological conditions, LSEC regulate bidirectional lipid exchange between the blood and the liver parenchyma, and thus play a crucial role in the maintenance of whole-body lipid homeostasis. This task is facilitated by the LSEC open fenestrae without organizing basement membranes, which enable macromolecules and lipoproteins to pass through the endothelial sieve from the sinusoidal lumen to the space of Disse, to be taken up by hepatocytes [16,17]. Hence, chylomicron remnants (triglyceridedepleted but cholesterol-and retinol-rich lipolytic products of chylomicrons), pass through the LSEC fenestrae, and are rapidly taken up by hepatocytes; whereas larger lipoproteins such as triglyceriderich parent chylomicrons are prone to be trapped in the sinusoidal lumen [18][19][20]. Given that hepatocytes require triglycerides carried by chylomicron remnants for VLDL synthesis; this sizebased selective trans-endothelial transport system mediated by LSEC fenestrae plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism under physiological conditions. Moreover, LSEC exhibit a high endocytic capacity, and contribute to the transfer of excess plasma lipids from the circulation to the liver parenchyma [21]. Li et al. reported that mildly oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in plasma is endocytosed by LSEC but not by Kupffer cells. This function of LSEC as a lipid scavenger is mainly mediated by the transmembrane receptor stabilin-1 on the LSEC surface [22] (Figure 2).",

First, the non-parenchymal cell (NPC) fraction which includes LSECs was separated from hepatocytes (HCs), and non-adherent cells were removed by selective adherence. When compared to HCs, the NPCs deprived of non-adherent cells showed higher expression of an endothelial cell maker Pecam1 (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, or Cd31), but lower levels of a hepatocyte marker Alb (Albumin). In contrast, the HCs expressed low Pecam1 and high Alb, confirming the separation of NPCs and HCs (Fig. 7c). Although the expression of Stab1 mRNA in the NPCs was not significantly different between C57BL/6J, 129S6 and DBA/2J, Stab2 mRNA was reduced in the NPCs of DBA/2J to less than 50% of those in C57BL/6J and 129S6 (p < 0.001). No ectopic expression of Stab2 was observed in the isolated HCs (Fig. 7c). We further purified LSECs by eliminating Kupffer cells, a type of tissue-resident macrophage, and other contaminating cells with CD11b + magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) followed by selective adherence, according to the protocol by Meyer et al. (2016) (Fig. S3). Before purification, the NPC fraction consists of approximately 50% LSECs, 20% Kupffer cells and 30% unidentified nonadherent cells (Fig. S3, panel (A)). Consistent with the .

            "text": "Therefore, it is speculated that the clustered NPs could not pass the LSEC fenestrae properly, due to their relatively substantial size. In sinusoidal vessels, the aggregated NPs can provide more opportunities to stimulate adjacent Kupffer cells to recruit various secondary inflammatory cells around the clumped NPs. Although silica NPs have been known to have low toxicity, aggregation of NPs seems to cause inflammation and toxicity in the liver. \n\nThe modification of the NP surface with a high affinity ligand binding to a cell-specific receptor is one of the most frequently used methods to improve cell targeting efficiency [4]. For example, coating of NP with vitamin A has been tried to target HSC in a previous study [45]. However, it was uncertain whether vitamin A-coated NP is beneficial in targeting HSCs, since the distributions of NPs in other types of liver cells were not determined in the previous study. In this study, we investigated the distribution patterns of NPs in liver by modifying surface energy. Interestingly, the size of the NPs along with the surface charge affected cellular distribution in the liver. Thus, the size of the NPs seems to be another important factor in determining specific NP delivery to target cells. \n\nThe present study describes, for the first time, the cellular distribution of silica NPs in the liver, based on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface modification of the NPs. The distribution of the NPs is influenced by their size and surface characteristics. Modifying the NP surface hydrophobicity is essential to improving NP delivery to the liver Kupffer cells and LSECs, whereas a hydrophilic surface modification is appropriate to deliver NPs to HSCs. Targeting hepatocytes using NPs is more complicated than targeting Kupffer cells, LSECs, or HSCs because of the location and the presence of reticuloendothelial barriers to protect hepatocytes. This study provides information imperative to targeting the specific types of liver cells using silica NPs and understanding the association between NP surface energy and the distribution pattern in the liver. Regardless of NP formulation, it seems the surface polarity of NPs is a crucial factor in determining their cellular distribution pattern in the liver.",

            "text": "Aging is associated with gradual changes in liver structure and physiological/pathological functions in hepatic cells including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). LSECs are specialized hepatic endothelial cells that regulate liver homeostasis. These cells actively impact the hepatic microenvironment as they have fenestrations and a thin morphology to allow substance exchange between circulating blood and the liver tissue. As aging occurs, LSECs have a reduction in both the number and size of fenestrations, which is referred to as pseudocapillarization. This along with the aging of the liver leads to increased oxidative stress, decreased availability of nitric oxide, decreased hepatic blood flow, and increased inflammatory cytokines in LSECs. Vascular aging can also lead to hepatic hypoxia, HSC activation, and liver fibrosis. In this review, we described the basic structure of LSECs, and the effect of LSECs on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis during aging process. We briefly summarized the changes of hepatic microcirculation during liver inflammation, the effect of aging on the clearance function of LSECs, the interactions between LSECs and immunity, hepatocytes or other hepatic nonparenchymal cells, and the therapeutic intervention of liver diseases by targeting LSECs and vascular system. Since LSECs play an important role in the development of liver fibrosis and the changes of LSEC phenotype occur in the early stage of liver fibrosis, the study of LSECs in the fibrotic liver is valuable for the detection of early liver fibrosis and the early intervention of fibrotic response.",

            "text": "Rats depleted of Kupffer cells were subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, which suppressed platelet adherence in sinusoids, and, as a consequence, there was attenuation of sinusoidal perfusion failure and endothelial damage. 29 amura et al. 63 reported that platelets adhered to Kupffer cells at the early period of ischemia/reperfusion and that the platelets that adhered Kupffer cells were involved in apoptosis of hepatocytes and the mechanism of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Nakamura et al. described different characteristics for platelets and Kupffer cells. The authors reported that direct cellular interactions between platelets and Kupffer cells play an important role in platelet migration to the space of Disse after administration of LPS. 64 It is therefore likely that platelets are activated by direct contact with Kupffer cells, and Kupffer cells are stimulated by direct contact with platelets. The collaborative effect of platelets with Kupffer cells on liver regeneration is thought to occur after hepatectomy, when activated Kupffer cells induce accumulation and activation of platelets in the liver, and the functions of Kupffer cells are enhanced by the accumulated platelets. Liver regeneration is promoted by the direct effect of growth factors released from platelets and by the paracrine effect of Kupffer cells, which is enhanced by the platelets (Fig. 2). \n\nThe cooperative effect with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Sinusoidal cells account for 70% of LSECs. The construction of a thin and continuous layer of sinusoidal endothelium forms a structural barrier that separates the hepatic parenchyma from blood constituents that pass through the liver. 65 SECs enable contact between circulating blood and hepatocytes and help exchange various soluble macromolecules and nanoparticles, such as lipoproteins. 66 LSECs are involved in liver regeneration and produce immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including HGF, IL-1, IL-6, and interferons.",

It has been demonstrated that two cell populations in the liver, hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), can activate naive CD8 + cells. The LSECs are a special type of endothelial cell lining the hepatic sinusoids that, unlike regular endothelial cells, are effi cient in the uptake of antigen and its presentation via MHC class I and II. Both in vitro culture experiments and an adoptive transfer model of isolated LSECs indicate that antigen presentation by LSECs can induce tolerance in CD8 + T cells (16). Hepatocytes have also been identifi ed as potential tolerogenic APCs for naive CD8 + lymphocytes. Transgenic expression of allogeneic MHC class I molecules on cultured hepatocytes induced rapid activation of TCR transgenic CD8 + lymphocytes specifi c for the allo-MHC, followed by their premature death (17). However, adoptive transfer of TCR transgenic lymphocytes caused hepatocyte damage, suggesting that the T cells were fully activated (18). Recent investigations have demonstrated that depending on the promoter used, the transgenic allo-MHC class I antigen was also expressed in lymphatic tissue, which resulted in a productive immune response. This led to the hypothesis that localized antigen presentation by hepatocytes results in tolerance by causing premature T cell death, whereas antigen presentation in lymphatic tissue by professional APCs promotes immunity (19). \n\nEach approach to the analysis of the immune responses to liver antigens carries its own burden of complicating factors. Isolated populations of potential liver APCs are subject to issues of low-level contamination by other cell types, and their isolation from the liver's architecture may change their biological function.",

Hence, siRNA for silencing of gene expression, or mRNA for gene expression are loaded in nanoparticles to carry these oligonucleotides past the LSECs and the liver and bring them intact to the cellular site of their intended therapeutic activity. Much effort is therefore spent to generate nanoparticles that carry therapeutic RNA to the intended cellular site. Out of a plethora of different types of nanoparticles that have been previously tested as vehicles for therapeutic RNA and other drug candidates, it appears that specially designed lipid nanoparticles have particularly attractive properties. This includes ease of manufacture, reduced immune responses, multidosing capabilities, larger payloads, and flexibility of design (Kulkarni et al., 2018). Although much effort is directed toward designing nanoparticles that reach the intended target cells with high precision and enable the RNA cargo to enter the intracellular compartment, the true \"elephant in the room, \" that is uncontrolled clearance by LSECs, is still a serious challenge that must be overcome. A few of those nanoparticlecarried RNA therapeutics that have made it successfully to the market include gene correction drugs that target the hepatocytes (Roberts et al., 2020). The LSECs allow passage of these nanoparticles (50 nm) through their fenestrae (i.e., open pores of diameter 100-150 nm). Circulating ApoB binds to these lipid nanoparticles, which mediate binding to the hepatocyte low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (Akinc et al., 2010). The same authors showed that conjugation of the particle surface with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), a ligand for the GalNAc receptor [aka asialoglycoprotein receptor, or Ashwell-Morell receptor, (Morell et al., 1971)] that are present on hepatocytes, but not on LSECs, strengthened the uptake of these lipid nanoparticles to the hepatocytes.",

            "text": ", 2019). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as a paracrine signal produced by hepatocytes and HSCs, maintains the differentiated phenotype of LSECs (DeLeve et al., 2004). When co-cultured with HSCs or hepatocytes in vitro, the expression of CD31 on the surface of LSECs was decreased, while anti-VEGF antibody reversed the decrease (DeLeve et al., 2004). Fortuitously, NO synthase inhibitor blocked the stabilizing effect of hepatocytes or HSCs on LSECs phenotype in the co-cultured system, suggesting that NO may be also necessary for maintaining the differentiated phenotype of LSECs and that the decreased NO bioavailability may promote the capillarization of LSECs, which may be associated with endothelial dysfunction of LSECs (DeLeve et al., 2004;Flammer et al., 2012;Hammoutene and Rautou, 2019). Capillarization of LSECs promotes the development of steatosis in NAFLD. On the one hand, the capillarization of LSECs prevents the release of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) from hepatocytes into the sinusoidal cavity, resulting in the retention of lipids including cholesterol and triglycerides in the liver (Hammoutene and Rautou, 2019). On the other hand, the capillarization of LSECs prevents the entry of chylomicron remnants into hepatocytes, stimulating the de novo lipogenesis of liver lipids and eventually inducing steatosis in a compensatory way since the chylomicron remnants are required for the synthesis of VLDL by hepatocytes (Herrnberger et al., 2014;Tanaka and Iwakiri, 2016). However, studies showed that excessive lipid exposure, such as ox-LDL, leads to a decrease in the fenestrae diameter and porosity of LSECs . Furthermore, Cogger and colleagues demonstrated that the porosity and fenestrae frequency of LSECs are negatively correlated with dietary fat intake and circulating FFA in vivo (Cogger et al",

            "text": "The effects of hydrophobic or hydrophilic surface modification in NP delivery to hepatocytes have not yet been fully studied. The size of the silica NPs we used was approximately 250-270 nm, which is smaller than the size of LSEC fenestrae, so it is feasible that the NPs can pass through the fenestrae. Therefore, based on the results of this study, we assumed that the surface polarity of silica NPs was not associated with NP delivery to the hepatocytes. \n\nAlthough it is important to target hepatocytes to treat HCC effectively, various types of nanoparticles with the modified surface charge used in the experiments were not appropriate for targeting hepatocytes. Modification of the surface charge alone did not directly affect the targeting of hepatocytes. In order to deliver nanoparticles to hepatocytes, it is preferable to apply various conditions in combination. In our study, there was a limit that hydrophilic-NP-PBS had less liver reach than hydrophobic surface modification NPs. However, since hydrophilic NPs have overcome the barrier and reached relatively large numbers of HSCs and hepatocytes, it is expected that more NPs will reach the hepatocyte by decreasing the size of the hydrophilic NPs and administering the higher concentration of nanoparticles. \n\nSilica NPs, which have low toxicity, are usually used as a drug delivery system due to the convenience of modifying or functionalizing the NP surfaces [43]. However, it is reported that silica NPs can induce oxidative stress and inflammation [28,44]. Agglomerated silica NPs caused inflammation, in this study, notably associated with the hydrophobic-NP-PBS rather than the hydrophilic-NP-PBS and hydrophobic-NP-olive oil (Figure 7B). Therefore, inflammation does not seem to be associated with the surface modification of NPs. As mentioned above, the size ranges of LSEC fenestrae in mice are between 50 and 280 nm, and the aggregated NPs must be larger than 280 nm. Therefore, it is speculated that the clustered NPs could not pass the LSEC fenestrae properly, due to their relatively substantial size.",

            "text": "Understanding the hepatic clearance of nanomaterials (NMs) is crucial for the development of safer NMs in the biomedical field [2]. Previous studies have reported that the unique structures and blood flow features of the liver facilitate the sequestration and accumulation of NMs, potentially leading to adverse effects in the liver [21]. The clearance patterns of hard NMs, such as Au, Ag, and QDs, have been carefully investigated [8]. In the liver, Kupffer cells, hepatic B cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells may uptake these NMs. Phagocytic Kupffer cells and hepatocytes represent the two major cellular phenotypes involved in the hepatic clearance of NMs [22]. Additionally, size, as one of the most important physicochemical parameters of NMs, plays an important role in regulating target cell types and degradation pathways that interact with the liver [23]. Generally, NMs larger than approximately 200 nm are effectively cleared by Kupffer cells due to the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids, allowing sufficient time for NM uptake. The endothelium of the hepatic sinusoids is discontinuous, interspersed with pores of approximately 100-200 nm in diameter, providing an opportunity for NMs smaller than the fenestrations to cross the endothelium into the Disse space, then enter the lymphatic circulation or be taken up by hepatocytes [22]. \n\nThe clearance pattern of s-GOs and l-GOs was analyzed by detecting labeled Yb via ICP-MS. The data show that the content of s-GOs (54 \u00b5g/g) in the liver of s-GO-treated mice was slightly higher than that in l-GO-treated mice (49 \u00b5g/g) after 4 h of intravenous injection (Figure 2A).",

Therefore, the discovery of new ligands for liver targeting, instead of the use of the conventional ligands, is very important. Another ligand for hepatocytes was investigated by Lin et al. [114] in which chitosan nanoparticles surface was modified with glycyrrhizin (CS-NPs-GL) as new hepatocyte-targeted delivery vehicles and concluded that CS-NPs-GL could be a promising hepatocyte-targeted delivery carrier. But Negishi et al. [66] showed that the number of binding sites for glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is much more than that for GL. Therefore, Tion et al. [115] prepared glycyrrhetinic acid-modified chitosan/poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles for liver-targeted delivery and found that the cellular uptake of nanoparticles modified with glycyrrhetinic acid by rat hepatocytes was 19-fold higher than that of unmodified ones. In fact delivery of NDDS (like liposomes, niosomes, nanoparticles, and phytosomes) and proteins to the hepatocytes using ASGP-R as a target receptor was one of the first options for the cell specific delivery to the liver cells although this has not led to any clinical application yet. \n\n6.1.2.

This was accompanied by a significantly higher transgene DNA copy number in hepatocytes of splenectomized Balb/c mice and of Balb/c rag-2 -/-mice than in hepatocytes of wild-type Balb/c mice 7 . Splenectomy in Balb/c rag-2 -/-mice did not result in an incremental effect 7 . This suggests that humoral factors produced by spleen lymphocytes may affect the clearance of adenoviral vectors by liver reticulo-endothelial cells in Balb/c mice. In contrast, no such effects on intrahepatic transgene DNA distribution were observed in splenectomized C57BL/6 mice and in C57BL/6 rag-1 -/-mice, suggesting highly heterogeneous effects of humoral factors produced by spleen lymphocytes on liver reticuloendothelial cells. Further evidence for a major role of liver reticulo-endothelial cells as a determinant of hepatocyte transduction comes from experiments with clodronate liposomes. Depletion of Kupffer cells and macrophages in the spleen by intravenous administration of clodronate liposomes results in significantly increased transgene DNA levels in parenchymal liver cells 7 and in increased transgene expression 6,7,48,49 . Since liver sinusoidal endothelial cell function may be modified by Kupffer cells 50,51 , it cannot be excluded that part of the effect of clodronate liposomes is due to reduced activation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells by Kupffer cells. Besides clodronate liposomes, pre-administration of polyinosinic acid, a scavenger receptor A ligand, before gene transfer has been shown to prevent sequestration of adenoviral vectors in Kupffer cells and to enhance parenchymal liver cell transduction 52 .

            "text": "Key examples from the literature on liver-targeting LNPs are summarized in Table 2. The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

            "text": "The default accumulation site of LNPs is the liver, where they acquire apolipoprotein E (apoE) from the bloodstream, facilitating their uptake by hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [37,38]. Alternatively, LNPs can also be decorated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligands, which bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocytes, directing the nanoparticles through receptor-mediated endocytosis [37]. This dual approach maximizes therapeutic efficacy and minimizes off-target effects, offering a robust framework for liver-specific delivery of advanced LNP-based therapies. Nevertheless, commercial LNP formulations have primarily been used for intramuscular (IM) administration, such as in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, targeting the liver. This narrow focus constrains their potential applications beyond livertargeted treatments. Targeting organs beyond the liver is critical due to the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy for different diseases and reduce hepatic toxicity. LNPs can also concentrate therapeutic agents in targeted tissues by enabling organ-specific drug delivery. Siegwart et al. developed the Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) system, directing LNPs to the lung, spleen, and liver after intravenous (IV) administration [29] (Figure 2a). By introducing SORT molecules based on the four existing lipids mentioned above, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles are modulated. SORT molecules include cationic lipids for lung targeting, anionic lipids for spleen targeting, and ionizable amino lipids for liver targeting. These lipids interact with the traditional components, altering the nanoparticles' surface charge, hydrophobicity, and interaction with biological membranes. As a result, LNPs can engage with specific cellular receptors, promoting selective uptake by target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis or enhanced membrane fusion. In recent advancements, they presented a gene editing approach based on the SORT system, achieving significant and long-lasting genome editing in lung stem cells after IV administrations [30].",

            "text": "LSECs line the hepatic sinusoids, but, unlike vascular endothelial cells, do not have a basal membrane, and feature fenestrations facilitating substance exchange between blood and the hepatocytes beneath the endothelium (Fig. 2). Similar to KCs, LSECs express low levels of MHC II and co-stimulatory molecules, but high levels of co-inhibitory molecules such as programmed death ligand-1 [51,52]. Accordingly, stimulation of CD4 T cells by LSECs typically results in the suppression of inflammatory activities [53,54]. Moreover, LSECs have been even found to induce a suppressive phenotype in conventional CD4 T cells [55]. Furthermore, owed to their ability to tether TGFb to their outer cell membrane, LSECs can effectively induce Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells that have profound immunosuppressive capacity [14]. Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that nanoparticle-mediated delivery of myelin peptides to LSECs induced antigen-specific immune suppression and provided protection from myelindriven CD4 T cell-mediated neuroinflammation [56]. \n\nLSECs are also highly effective inducers of CD8 T cell tolerance [52,57], owed to their remarkable capacity to cross-present antigens taken up by endocytosis [57,58]. LSECs are also able to induce CD8 memory T cells, which remain non-responsive during steady-state and require strong signals for re-activation [59,60]. Accordingly, nanoparticle-mediated delivery of MHC I-restricted autoantigen peptide was found to induce antigen-specific CD8 T cell tolerance and protection from antigen-driven cholangitis [61]. Importantly, although it was found that LSECs acquire enhanced immunogenicity in liver fibrosis [62], it was also shown that tolerance induction by LSECs was robust when stimulated with inflammation inducers and overcome only by viral infection [31]. Thus, in contrast to other professional antigen-presenting cells, including those in the liver, LSECs display a low plasticity and a high resilience towards external inflammatory stimuli.",

Studies in rats have shown that the initial series of events are driven by the mechanical process by which cells enter vascular spaces beyond the portal areas, which is dependent upon the size of cells and the diameter of hepatic sinusoids [54]. The larger the size of cells, the more proximal will these be to portal areas, and the smaller the size of cells, the more distal in the liver lobule will these be in relationship to portal areas. This essential size-structure relationship drives the nature of cell-cell adhesions, as well as the extent of vaso-occlusive processes that may be initiated by cell transplantation. Rodent studies have shown that subsequent cell-cell signalling events are important. The ischemic injury rapidly activates neutrophils, Kupffer cells, LSECs and hepatic stellate cells [58,59]. The initial engraftment processes where vascular responses involve release of locally-acting vasoactive molecules, such as NO and prostacyclins, complement, platelet-related thrombogenic substances, endothelin, cyclooxygenases, cytokines/ chemokines/receptors, are largely deleterious. However, release of some substances, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from native hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, monocytes and hepatic stellate cells helps in permeabilization of endothelial cells. Coupled with the activation of LSEC, transplanted cells are able to penetrate the endothelial barrier and then integrate themselves into the liver parenchyma [56]. This part of the process requires 16-20 h from cell delivery. However, cumulatively, nearly 80-90% of all transplanted hepatocytes are destroyed due to sinusoidal events, including lack of entry into sinusoids, inadequate or no adhesion to sinusoidal endothelium, oxidative stress, cytokine-mediated toxicity,",

Upon intravenous administration, most LNPs accumulate in the liver and spleen, where they are taken up by reticuloendothelial system (RES) cells or hepatocytes, restricting their distribution to other tissues (Shi et al., 2011;Sago et al., 2019). As a result, their therapeutic effectiveness at tumor sites may be compromised (El Moukhtari et al., 2023;Gomes-da-Silva et al., 2012). \n\nIn order to overcome such limitations, focus has been drawn to the development of new strategies to evade the RES clearance of nanoparticles (Ouyang et al., 2020). By transiently blocking the RES, the blood circulation time of nanoparticles can be extended, thereby increasing the likelihood of tumor accumulation through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Sun et al., 2017).",

            "text": "In contrast to other blood vessels, the hepatic sinusoids are specialized vascular structures that lack a basement membrane and instead are lined by fenestrated (porous) endothelial cells, so-called LSECs (70). LSECs have both sinusoidal and abluminal sides and can communicate with hepatocytes and HSCs through the abluminal side (71). Under normal physiological conditions, the fenestrae on LSECs mediate the exchange of plasma, nutrients, lipids, and lipoproteins between the sinusoidal lumen and the space of Disse, allowing only particles smaller than the fenestrae to reach the parenchymal cells (72). Moreover, in a healthy liver, LSECs prevent HSC activation and promote reversion to a quiescent state through VEGF-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production (73). Upon liver injury, however, fenestrae on LSECs undergo drastic changes in their structural and functional properties (74). Defenestration, a reduction in the number and diameter of fenestrae and formation of a continuous basement membrane of LSECs, so-called capillarization, are characteristics typical of chronic liver diseases (Figure 1) (60). While the structural modification of fenestrae can protect the liver from further damage by restricting toxins approaching the parenchymal cells, the defenestration on LSECs influences hepatocytes by creating a microenvironment lacking nutrients and oxygen (75). The lack of nutrients and oxygen from the blood flow impacts the physiological function of hepatocytes and could lead to further progression of liver injury (75). LSECs also indirectly promote liver fibrosis by secreting pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors (76). Defenestration, the main characteristic of activated LSECs, precedes fibrogenesis in the liver (77). Defenestration and capillarization of LSECs due to liver injury promote the activation of HSCs, contributing to liver fibrosis through loss of VEGF-stimulated NO production (60).",

            "text": "Liver non-parenchymal cells, or NPCs, make up for an approximate 20% of liver volume and NPCs play many roles in the liver, primarily in maintaining hepatic structure and functionality. Liver damage significantly alters both the phenotype and function of a non-parenchymal cell, significantly reducing the ability of the liver to recover appropriately. Three of the most abundant and important NPC of the liver are sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells. Other important NPC types that also reside in the liver but are less abundant are fibroblasts, neutrophils, and macrophages. With regard to their interactions with NBMs, NPCs play vital roles, with NBMs interacting with varying NPCs, before reaching hepatocytes. Kupffer cells recognise NBMs as foreign materials, with NBMs being internalised through scavenger receptors and subsequently taken up by micropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and various other endocytosis pathways [35]. It is the Kupffer cells, along with the blood-circulating monocytes and macrophages in other tissues including spleen and gut, which constitute the mononuclear phagocyte system, or MPS. The MPS, also known as the reticular endothelial system, is responsible for sequestering approximately 95% of NBMs administered [36], with the rate of uptake highly dependent on NBM characteristics such as surface chemistry, size, and ligand chemistry. It is reported that larger NBMs, ranging in size from 400 to 600 nm, are preferentially phagocytosed by these cells, along with particles that are neutrally charged (i.e., PEG coatings). Studies have also shown that rod-shaped NBMs exhibit a reduced clearance compared to their spherical counterparts, potentially due to the presence of fewer accessible binding areas for interactions with macrophages [37,38]. Various studies have highlighted this phenomenon, with Lunov et al. showing that 20-nm and 60-nm SPIONs accumulated irrespective of their size in macrophages via clathrin-mediated and scave",

            "text": "The location and anatomy of the liver, positioned between the gastrointestinal tract and the systemic circulation, allows it to conduct its functions of digestion, synthesis of plasma proteins and detoxification (1). Circulating blood from the gastrointestinal tract enriched with food antigens (Ags) and environmental microbial products, including endotoxin, converge in the liver portal vein (2). The hepatic artery, which provides about 20% of the liver blood supply, and the hepatic portal vein mix in the liver to create sinusoids. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are located in the space of Diss\u00e9 and form an immediate barrier between the hepatocytes and the bloodstream (1,3). The non-parenchymal cell populations including dendritic cells (DC), Kupffer cells (KC), and LSEC constitute the hepatic reticulo-endothelial system, which is responsible for clearing Ags and degradation of toxins from sinusoidal blood by uptake through endocytic receptors (1). The cross-talk between T cells and liver parenchymal cells, including LSEC, hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and cholangiocytes, plays a crucial role in tolerance induction (4). \n\n\"Spontaneous\" liver transplant tolerance has been demonstrated in both animals and humans, however, the mechanisms that underlie development of tolerance to the liver but not to other solid organ grafts are still not well-understood. We will summarize recent research findings, focusing on (i) the specific contributions of immune cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and parenchymal cell subsets that promote a tolerogenic microenvironment within the liver, (ii) mechanisms of organ-specific tolerance, and (iii) novel strategies to predict and promote liver transplant tolerance.",

(16,17) They are located in the space of Disse, a space between hepatocyte lineage cells and LSECs. Wake (18) illustrated their striking three-dimensional structure using Golgi staining, showing that HSCs wrap LSECs on one side and contact hepatocytes on the other side with their well-developed cytoplasmic processes. According to this anatomic disposition, HSCs are liver-specific \"pericytes,\" although an evident basement membrane is lacking in the case of hepatic sinusoids. \n\nPhysiologically, the principal function of HSCs is their storage of lipid droplets consisting of retinyl esters, triglycerides, cholesterol esters, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Accordingly, HSCs were previously called \"lipocytes,\" \"fat-storing cells,\" or \"vitamin A-storing cells.\" (19) HSCs also take part in regulating sinusoidal microcirculation through their contractility in response to vasoactive substances, including endothelin-1, angiotensin II, and nitric oxide (NO), (20,21) and in storing gaseous mediators, such as O 2 , NO, and carbon monoxide, by expressing cytoglobin (CYGB). (22) ollowing chronic liver injury or culture in vitro , HSCs undergo an \"activation\" process and transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like cells that express \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and generate extracellular matrix (ECM) materials, including collagen (COL) I, collagen III, laminin, and fibronectin, contributing to the progression of fibrosis.",

CD11b-positive preparations contained approximately 80% Kupffer cells/monocytes and 20% granulocytes. LSECs were isolated from the CD11bnegative population by anti-ICAM-1 magnetic bead cell sorting. They were identified by their relatively small size (8 -10 m), clear cytoplasm, and oval nuclei (Fig. 1A). LSEC preparations typically were 90% pure and contained Kupffer cells (2%) and red blood cells (8%) as contaminants. \n\nAnalysis of the LSEC preparation by flow cytometry demonstrated that the cells expressed cell surface markers ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 and contained a subpopulation of the cells that bound wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 2). LSECs did not stain with the monocyte/macrophage-specific marker CD14 or the endothelial marker VCAM-1 (data not shown). These findings are similar to previously described phenotypic characteristics of murine LSECs, which were ICAM-1 \u03e9 /PECAM-1 \u03e9 /VCAM-1 \u03e9 and contained two subpopulations that differentially bound wheat germ agglutinin (18,19). The reason for the lack of VCAM-1 staining in our LSEC preparation is not known, although the cells became VCAM-1 \u03e9 after cell culture. \n\nQuantitation of FVIII mRNA by Competitive RT-PCR-Ini- tial experiments demonstrated that fVIII mRNA could be identified by RT-PCR in LSECs and hepatocytes, but not Kupffer cells (data not shown).",

            "text": "We previously reported that unmodified silica nanoparticles with diameters of 70\u2009nm (nSP70) induced liver damage in mice, whereas nSP70 modified with carboxyl or amino groups did not. In addition, we have found that both unmodified and modified nSP70s localize in both Kupffer cells and parenchymal hepatocytes. We therefore evaluated the contributions of nSP70 uptake by these cell populations to liver damage. To this end, we pretreated mice with gadolinium (III) chloride hydrate (GdCl3) to prevent nSP70 uptake by Kupffer cells, subsequently injected the mice with either type of nSP70, and then assessed plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In mice given GdCl3, unmodified nSP70 increased ALT levels. From these data, we hypothesized that in GdCl3-treated mice, the unmodified nSP70 that was prevented from entering Kupffer cells was shunted to parenchymal hepatocytes, where it induced cytotoxicity and increased liver damage. In contrast, GdCl3 pretreatment had no effect on ALT levels in mice injected with surface-modified nSP70s, suggesting that modified nSP70s spared parenchymal hepatocytes and thus induced negligible liver damage. In cytotoxicity analyses, the viability of a parenchymal hepatocyte line was greater when exposed to surface-modified nSP70s than to unmodified nSP70s. These findings imply that the decreased liver damage associated with surface-modified compared with unmodified nSP70 is attributable to decreased cytotoxicity to parenchymal hepatocytes.",

            "text": "Moreover, when galactosylated low-molecular-weight chitosan/oligodeoxynucleotide complexes of 150 nm in diameter were intravenously injected into mice, Kupffer cells (50.6%) and LSECs (33.2%) endocytosed 483% of the complexed molecules, whereas hepatocytes endocytosed only 16.2% of the complexed molecules (Dong et al., 2008). These studies indicate that hepatocyte-or Kupffer cell-specific delivery can be achieved by controlling the size of the nanoparticles. \n\nMannose/N-acetylglucosamine receptor-mediated delivery. In the liver, mannose is mainly removed via mannose receptors expressed on Kupffer cells and LSECs. Therefore, mannosebased delivery systems are more likely to be endocytosed by Kupffer cells or LSECs than by hepatocytes (Chaubey & Mishra, 2014;Kawakami et al., 2000;Nishikawa et al., 1993). As mentioned in the section ''Carbohydrate (glycoprotein) receptor-mediated delivery'', the expression and endocytic capacity of the mannose/N-acetylglucosamine receptor are greater in LSECs than in Kupffer cells (Bijsterbosch et al., 1996;Kogelberg et al., 2007;Magnu \u00b4sson & Berg, 1993). However, the cellular uptake of mannose-mediated delivery systems depends on the amount and type of mannose molecules (Hirata et al., 2010;Jansen et al., 1991). For example, human serum albumin (HSA) terminated with seven para-aminophenyl mannose residues (Man7-HSA) is mainly taken up by Kupffer cells, but Man22-HSA and Man40-HSA are endocytosed by Kupffer cells and LSECs (Jansen et al., 1991).",

They are very specialized endothelial cells that discontinuously line the wall of hepatic sinusoids and make a unique permeable barrier between blood within the sinusoids and the underlying hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. LSECs have distinctive morphological features, including the presence of numerous small open pores called fenestrae, and the absence of a classical basement membrane and diaphragm, which help their permeability. LSEC fenestration provides access of hepatocytes to certain substances from the circulating blood by connecting the lumen of the sinusoids with the space of Disse. In addition, LSECs have important physiological and immunological functions such as the regulation of hepatic vascular tone by synthesizing nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), the maintenance of hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells in a quiescence state, filtration, endocytosis, antigen presentation and leukocyte recruitment. LSECs are the first liver cells to be affected by liver injury and contribute to the initiation and progression of liver disease. Thus, following liver injury, LSECs undergo morphological changes culminating in capillarization (defenestration), which causes sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction [13,14].",

            "text": "As the largest solid organ in the body, the liver consists of multiple cell types that are responsible for the organism-level functions of metabolism, detoxification, coagulation, and immune response. Four major liver cell types-hepatocytes (HCs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), Kupffer cells (KCs), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs)-spatiotemporally cooperate to shape and maintain liver functions. HCs constitute \u03f370% of the total liver cell population. The remaining population is composed of the NPCs, namely LSECs, KCs and HSCs (1). As the parenchymal portion of the liver, HCs are primarily engaged in the basic functions of the liver, including lipid metabolism, drug metabolism, and the secretion of coagulation and complement factors (2). KCs, which represent one-third of the NPCs in the liver (3), serve as immune sentinels. Although HSCs comprise only 5% of the liver cells, they play central roles in vitamin A and lipid storage (4,5). LSECs, which comprise the largest part (50%) of liver NPCs, separate the underlying HCs from the sinusoidal lumen (6). \n\nThe distinct cell types of the liver are arranged in a highly organized architectural pattern with individual cells in communication with each other (7). Correlation and crosstalk between the different cell types are common (8). It has been increasingly recognized that under both physiological and pathological conditions, HCs are regulated by factors released from neighboring NPCs (9). KCs, in response to pathogenic agents, produce inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induce hepatic injury (10). Acute damage activates the transformation of hepatic stellate cells into myofibroblast-like cells that play a key role in the development of liver fibrosis (11). LSECs contribute to liver regeneration after liver injury (12).",

These mice express membrane-targeted eGFP in the LSEC, while membranes of the other cell types of the liver remain red (Video 3). The LSECs line the sinusoidal lumen and their nuclei show only a weak Hoechst signal compared to hepatocytes. Remarkably, in Tie2 \u00d7 mT/mG reporter mice further cells in the sinusoidal lumen also express eGFP. Among them, platelets appear as small flakes rapidly flowing through the sinusoids, which is helpful for identification of the direction of the blood flow. These platelets can form transient aggregates (Video 3, 21-34 min).\n\nLSEC can also be stained by fluorescently labeled latex nanoparticles. Particles with a diameter larger than 500 nm are known to be exclusively taken up by macrophages. In contrast, smaller sized particles, below 100 nm, are taken up by macrophages as well as by LSEC (Fig. 3c). While fluorescent latex nanoparticles visualize both LSEC and Kupffer cells, lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin preferentially bind to glycoproteins of LSEC (Video 6). Injection of fluorescently labeled lectins is therefore an additional method that can be used to mark the sinusoidal network.",

Depending on their physicochemical properties, first of all on their size, NPs smaller than the diameter of sinusoid fenestrations (50-150 nm) can freely diffuse into the Disse space and can be taken up by hepatocytes [17,28]. ere are also other factors that can more likely favor the uptake of NPs by hepatocytes, in particular, PEGylation and NP positive surface charge [29,30]. Hepatobiliary clearance is generally an active process promoted by transporters and realized by many drug-metabolizing enzymes and then followed by secretion into the bile duct via bile canaliculi or either back into the bloodstream [26,31]. However, the hepatocyte uptake occurs only with smaller size NPs (less than 50 nm) or when large doses of NPs have been injected or if macrophages have been chemically depleted [26,32].\n\nA minor role in NP clearance is also performed by the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LESCs).

            "text": "As mentioned above, LSECs undergo the loss of endothelial permeability in CLD. Recently a study showed that TiO 2 NPs could restore sinusoidal permeability by inducing transient leakiness in primary human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HHSECs), which could improve hepatic recovery and upregulate drug uptake (Tee et al., 2018). \n\nMoreover, in blood, over 90% of hyaluronic acid (HA) is taken and metabolized by LSECs due to the receptors on them (DeLeve and Maretti-Mira, 2017). Therefore, HA modified delivery systems can be used for LSEC targeting in liver fibrosis. Ohya et al. developed biodegradable polyanion-coated polymeric micelles conjugated with HA by polyion complex (PIC) formation, which were taken up only into LSECs (Ohya et al., 2011). \n\nIt has been reported that rather than hepatocytes, LSECs play the key role in the initial uptake of virus into the liver in a hepatitis B virus model. Fluorescent viral particles and virus proteincoated gold particles exhibited a preferential uptake of the viral substrates into LSECs (Breiner et al., 2001). Thus, utilizing viral pathways of cell targeting in liver might be a candidate for drug delivery to fibrotic liver. Abel et al. prepared mouse CD105-specific lentiviral vectors (mCD105-LV) that can specifically transduce LSECs (Abel et al., 2013). Another work took use of the endocytic uptake by LSECs to deliver antigens to the liver (Liu et al., 2021). The tolerogenic nanoparticles (TNPs) attached ApoBP ligand presented antigens to regulate the differentiation of naive T-cells into Tregs (Figure 5). It seems that LSECs-targeting antigen delivery might be a hopeful candidate in the immune regulation for autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune hepatitis.",

An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195]. In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1. as demonstrated by reduced ALT and AST serum and decreased hepatic alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression [190].",

(4) and van Berkel et al. ( 14) have found that the clearance of modified LDL is mediated by liver sinusoidal cells. Such cells are a mixture of endothelial cells, lto cells, and Kupffer cells (15). Using the in vivo injection of ~25I-labeled Ac LDL, followed by the isolation of hepatic cells, Nagelkerke et al. (16) found that hepatic endothelial cells were primarily responsible for the in vivo uptake of the lipoproteins. Lower levels of uptake were noted in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. These observations, along with those showing that aortic endothelial cells in vitro metabolize low levels of Ac LDL (6), suggest that endothelia in general contribute in varying degrees to the clearance of modified lipoproteins from the blood. \n\nTo determine the specific cells responsible for the clearance of modified LDL in various organs and their relative contributions, we injected rats, dogs, and guinea pigs with Ac LDL or AcAc LDL labeled with either 1251 or the lipophilic fluorescent probe, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI) (17). Tissue was then examined microscopically by two complementary techniques, fluorescence microscopy and autoradiography. The uptake of AcAc LDL, by the three most active tissues, was then confirmed by electron microscopy. These techniques avoid the problems associated with the use of cell isolation procedures and the possible metabolism of ~JSI-labeled Ac LDL (before and during cell isolation), as well as possible cross-contamination of the isolated cells. Using these procedures, it was found that the sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver, spleen, marrow, and adrenal mediate the in vivo clearance of AcAc LDL. The ability of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells to metabolize AcAc LDL at a rapid rate was confirmed in in vitro studies.",

            "text": "In mice, 98% of intravenous Ad5 is absorbed by the liver [4]. Approximately 65% of the liver cells are hepatocytes, 25% are liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and 7% are Kupffer and other cells [40]. Previous work by Shayakhmetov's group showed that one must detarget Kupffer cells, LSECs, and hepatocytes to significantly reduce all Ad5 sequestration by the liver [41]. In this work, the detargeting strategies each combat only one or two of these overlapping sequestration mechanisms. \n\nKupffer cells are the resident macrophage in the liver [6] and are thought to absorb most injected Ad5 [4]. Of the detargeting strategies tested, only PEGylation is thought to detarget Kupffer cells [21]. LSECs are another mechanism for Ad sequestration from the blood [41]. There are approximately four times as many LSECs as Kupffer cells, so even less efficient uptake by these cells may significantly alter the fate of systemically administered Ads. Of the detargeting strategies tested, PEGylation appears able to reduce endothelial cell uptake in vitro [23], but it is unclear if this occurs in vivo. \n\nBoth Kupffer and LSECs reside in the blood supply feeding the liver parenchyma. Therefore, intravenous Ad5 must evade both Kupffer cells and LSECs before reaching hepatocytes within the parenchyma. In the presence of FX, Ad5 is protected from complement and partially protected from destruction by Kupffer cells, this is mediated by complement fixation [42,43]. BAP insertion blocked FX-binding to markedly reduce hepatocyte infection and sequestration [10]. The BAP reduces but overall uptake of Ad5 in the whole liver in mice with intact natural antibody and complement levels, but not in nude or Rag\u2212/\u2212 mice [13]. It is unclear if the presence of the large BAP on hexon reduces natural antibody or complement deposition on Ad and Kupffer cell sequestration.",

The surface charge (i.e. z potential) should be slightly negative (Xiao et al., 2011) to prevent sequestration of particles in the lung (i.e. due to a positive charge) (Ishiwata et al., 2000) or rapid clearance by cells expressing scavenger receptors (i.e. due to an excessive negative charge) (Rothkopf et al., 2005). According to the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory of colloids, a neutral charge has to be avoided to prevent particle agglomeration. In addition to surface charge, steric stabilization by PEGylation mediates long circulating properties and prevents opsonization (Karmali et al., 2011)(Milla et al., 2012).",

PEGylation increase the size and molecular weight of conjugated biomolecules and improves their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodinamics by increasing water solubility, protecting from enzymatic degradation, reducing renal clearance and limiting immunogenic and antigenic reactions. PEGylated molecules show increased half-life, decreased plasma clearance, and different biodistribution, in comparison with non-PEGylated counterparts. These features appear to be very useful for therapeutic proteins, since the high stability and very low immunogenicity of PEGylated proteins result in sustained clinical response with minimal dose and less frequent administration. PEGylation of liposomes improves not only the stability and circulation time, but also the 'passive' targeting ability on tumoral tissues, through a process known as the enhanced permeation retention effect, able to improve the therapeutic effects and reduce the toxicity of encapsulated drug. The molecular weight, shape, reactivity, specificity, and type of bond of PEG moiety are crucial in determining the effect on PEGylated molecules and, at present, researchers have the chance to select among tens of PEG derivatives and PEG conjugation technologies, in order to design the best PEGylation strategy for each particular application. The aim of the present review will be to elucidate the principles of PEGylation chemistry and to describe the already marketed PEGylated proteins and liposomes by focusing our attention to some enlightening examples of how this technology could dramatically influence the clinical application of therapeutic biomolecules."

According to the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory of colloids, a neutral charge has to be avoided to prevent particle agglomeration.

Therefore, an understanding of the factors required for the efficient, selective, and safe delivery of siRNA is a great challenge for successful siRNA delivery. Herein, we report on the development of two pH-sensitive cationic lipids and their use in examining the impact of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) value, lipase sensitivity and the size of lipid nanoparticles on the biodistribution, and efficiency and cell specificity of gene silencing in the liver. An increase in the pKa value resulted in a significant change in the intrahepatic localization of siRNA and gene-silencing efficiency in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The sensitivity of the pH-sensitive cationic lipid to lipases was a major factor in achieving hepatocyte-specific gene silencing. Increasing the particle size can improve the LSEC specificity of gene silencing. As a consequence, we succeeded in developing both a highly efficient, hepatocyte-specific formulation, and the most efficacious LSEC-targeted formulation reported to date.

EL in both mouse and rat liver was colocalized with vascular endothelial cells but not with hepatocytes. In contrast, HL was present in both hepatocytes and endothelial cells. By in situ hybridization, EL mRNA was present only in endothelial cells in liver sections. EL was also present at low levels in aorta of normal mice. We fed EKO mice and wild-type mice a variety of diets and determined EL expression in liver and aorta. EKO mice showed significant expression of EL in aorta. EL expression was lower in the liver of EKO mice than in normal mice. Cholesterol feeding decreased EL in liver of both types of mice. In the aorta, EL was higher in EKO than in wild-type mice, and cholesterol feeding had no effect.

Liu et al. observed that nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm were rapidly cleared via renal filtration, resulting in low plaque accumulation (Liu et al., 2018). In the liver, since the diameter of fenestrae in normal liver sinusoid endothelial cells is about 50-200 nm (Cogger et al., 2010)(M\u00f6nkem\u00f6ller et al., 2014), nanoscaled particles with diameters < 200 nm can pass through sinusoids [170]. This is beneficial for nanoparticles to evade capture by Kupffer cells and reach hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells (Hu et al., 2018)(Liu et al., 2014). Nanoparticles with diameters > 400 nm can diffuse through the sinusoid endothelial fenestrations by forced extrusion, presumably owing to transient interaction with the sinusoidal endothelial cells (Romero et al., 1999). As a result, particles with larger size are more likely to be phagocytized by Kupffer cells (Ergen et al., 2017), especially 200-1000 nm (Pietrzak-Nguyen et al., 2014), even microbubbles of ultrasound imaging with the diameters of 1-10 \u00b5m (Yanagisawa et al., 2007)...The surface charge is also a factor that affects the cellular uptake of nanoparticles.

Microcapsules (MCs) are particularly attractive for innovative drug and vaccine formulations, enabling the combination of antigen, drugs, and adjuvants. The present study aimed to develop microcapsules characterized by an enhanced liver deposition and accelerated uptake by nonparenchymal liver cells (NPCs). Initially, two formulations of biodegradable microcapsules were synthesized from either hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or mannose. Notably, HES-MCs accumulated primarily in the liver, while mannose particles displayed a lung preference. Functionalization of HES-MCs with anti-CD40, anti-DEC205, and/or monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) enhanced uptake of MCs by nonparenchymal liver cells in vitro. In contrast, only MPLA-coated HES-MCs promoted significantly the in vivo uptake by NPCs. Finally, HES-MCs equipped with MPLA, anti-CD40, and anti-DEC205 induced the secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 by Kupffer cells (KCs), and IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12p70 by liver dendritic cells (DCs). The enhanced uptake and activation of KCs by MPLA-HES-MCs is a promising approach to prevent or treat infection, since KCs are exploited as an entry gate in various infectious diseases, such as malaria. In parallel, loading and activating liver DCs, usually prone to tolerance, bears the potential to induce antigen specific, intrahepatic immune responses necessary to prevent and treat infections affecting the liver."

Liu et al. observed that nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm were rapidly cleared via renal filtration, resulting in low plaque accumulation (Liu et al., 2018). In the liver, since the diameter of fenestrae in normal liver sinusoid endothelial cells is about 50-200 nm (Cogger et al., 2010)(M\u00f6nkem\u00f6ller et al., 2014), nanoscaled particles with diameters < 200 nm can pass through sinusoids [170]. This is beneficial for nanoparticles to evade capture by Kupffer cells and reach hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells (Hu et al., 2018)(Liu et al., 2014). Nanoparticles with diameters > 400 nm can diffuse through the sinusoid endothelial fenestrations by forced extrusion, presumably owing to transient interaction with the sinusoidal endothelial cells (Romero et al., 1999). As a result, particles with larger size are more likely to be phagocytized by Kupffer cells (Ergen et al., 2017), especially 200-1000 nm (Pietrzak-Nguyen et al., 2014), even microbubbles of ultrasound imaging with the diameters of 1-10 \u00b5m (Yanagisawa et al., 2007)"

The present study aimed to examine endocytosis of mildly oxLDL (the major circulating form of oxLDLs) in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the involvement of the scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 in this process. Freshly isolated LSECs, Kupffer cells (KCs), and stabilin-1- and stabilin-2-transfected human embryonic kidney cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled or radiolabeled oxLDLs [oxidized for 3 h (oxLDL(3)), 6 h, or 24 h (oxLDL(24))] to measure endocytosis. The intracellular localization of oxLDLs and stabilins in LSECs was examined by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy. Whereas oxLDL(24) was endocytosed both by LSECs and KCs, oxLDL(3) (mildly oxLDL) was taken up by LSECs only. The LSEC uptake of oxLDLs was significantly inhibited by the scavenger receptor ligand formaldehyde-treated serum albumin. Uptake of all modified LDLs was high in stabilin-1-transfected cells, whereas stabilin-2-transfected cells preferentially took up oxLDL(24), suggesting that stabilin-1 is a more important receptor for mildly oxLDLs than stabilin-2. Double immunogold labeling experiments in LSECs indicated interactions of stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 with oxLDL(3) on the cell surface, in coated pits, and endocytic vesicles. LSECs but not KCs endocytosed mildly oxLDL. Both stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 were involved in the LSEC endocytosis of oxLDLs, but experiments with stabilin-transfected cells pointed to stabilin-1 as the most important receptor for mildly oxLDL.",

Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues.

Herein, we report a method that can predict the LNP pKa from the structure of the ionizable lipid. We used theoretical, NMR, fluorescent-dye binding, and electrophoretic mobility methods to comprehensively measure protonation of both the ionizable lipid and the formulated LNP. The pKa of the ionizable lipid was 2-3 units higher than the pKa of the LNP primarily due to proton solvation energy differences between the LNP and aqueous medium. We exploited these results to explain a wide range of delivery efficiencies in vitro and in vivo for intramuscular (IM) and intravascular (IV) administration of different ionizable lipids at escalating ionizable lipid-to-mRNA ratios in the LNP. In addition, we determined that more negatively charged LNPs exhibit higher off-target systemic expression of mRNA in the liver following IM administration. This undesirable systemic off-target expression of mRNA-LNP vaccines could be minimized through appropriate design of the ionizable lipid and LNP. Carrasco et al. report a method that can predict the lipid nanoparticles (LNP) pKa from the structure of the ionizable lipid.

We examined the uptake, intracellular trafficking, and gene silencing potency in primary bone marrow macrophages (bmM\u03a6) and dendritic cells of siRNA formulated in LNPs containing four different ionizable cationic lipids namely DLinDAP, DLinDMA, DLinK-DMA, and DLinKC2-DMA. LNPs containing DLinKC2-DMA were the most potent formulations as determined by their ability to inhibit the production of GAPDH target protein. Also, LNPs containing DLinKC2-DMA were the most potent intracellular delivery agents as indicated by confocal studies of endosomal versus cytoplamic siRNA location using fluorescently labeled siRNA. DLinK-DMA and DLinKC2-DMA formulations exhibited improved gene silencing potencies relative to DLinDMA but were less toxic. In vivo results showed that LNP siRNA systems containing DLinKC2-DMA are effective agents for silencing GAPDH in APCs in the spleen and peritoneal cavity following systemic administration. Gene silencing in APCs was RNAi mediated and the use of larger LNPs resulted in substantially reduced hepatocyte silencing, while similar efficacy was maintained in APCs.

The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects.

Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity.

PEGylated nanoparticles are less efficiently taken by phagocytes. Sinusoidal endothelial cells found lining the vasculature of the liver sinusoid are also involved in innate immunity. It is involved in the elimination of waste macromolecules, including components of connective tissue and hyaluronan from blood circulation by receptor-ligand interactions. Both Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells likely compete for the nanoparticles present in the circulation. In addition, the nanoparticles' physicochemical properties, such as the hydrodynamic size, influence the mechanism of cellular internalization. Nanoparticles with a diameter greater than 100 nm or aggregated nanoparticles lower than 100 nm will have greater interaction with Kupffer cells. In contrast, sinusoidal endothelial cells might take up smaller monodisperse nanoparticles to a higher degree (Zhang et al., 2016)."

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

For example, LSECs have been shown to engulf particles with a diameter of up to 200 nm due to their internalization method of receptor-mediated endocytosis (Jacobs et al., 2010)[25]. This upper size limit is shown to facilitate intracellular accumulation in late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, an important mechanism for immunomodulation, within other non-phagocytic cells [25]. On the other hand, Kupffer cells, which can also utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis, preferentially uptake particles > 200 nm in the liver due to their phagocytic activity [25](Tian et al., 2019)...To access other liver cells, such as hepatocytes and HSCs, penetration through the liver sinusoidal fenestrae via the space of Diss\u00e9 may require minimization of nanoparticle size, ideally to <100 nm (Wisse et al., 1985). However, it has been shown that nanoparticles up to 400 nm have been able to extravasate into the space of Diss\u00e9 with a proper lipid composition of negatively charged phosphatidylserine (Daemen et al., 1997)...Kupffer cells and LSECs have also been shown to preferentially bind and clear negatively charged nanoparticles through interactions with scavenger receptors, such as stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 (Arias-Alpizar et al., 2021)(Cheng et al., 2012).

Gene transfer efficiency into hepatocytes is significantly determined by histological and functional aspects of liver sinusoidal cells. On the one hand, uptake of vectors by Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells may limit hepatocyte transduction. On the other hand, the presence of fenestrae in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells provides direct access to the space of Disse and allows vectors to bind to receptors on the microvillous surface of hepatocytes. Nevertheless, the diameter of fenestrae may restrict the passage of vectors according to their size. On the basis of lege artis measurements of the diameter of fenestrae in different species, we show that the diameter of fenestrae affects the distribution of transgene DNA between sinusoidal and parenchymal liver cells after adenoviral transfer. The small diameter of fenestrae in humans may underlie low efficiency of adenoviral transfer into hepatocytes in men. The disappearance of the unique morphological features of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in pathological conditions like liver cirrhosis and liver cancer may further affect gene transfer efficiency. Preclinical gene transfer studies should consider species differences in the structure and function of liver sinusoidal cells as important determinants of gene transfer efficiency into hepatocytes.",

In this work, we report the first application of intravital multiphoton fluorescence microscopy to dynamically track the hepatic metabolism of nanoparticles with subcellular resolution in real time. Using fluorescently labeled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) in mice as a prototypical model, we observed significant hepatocyte uptake of positively charged, but not negatively charged, moieties. Conversely, in vivo imaging of negatively charged, but not positively charged, MSNs reveals an overwhelming propensity for the former's rapid uptake by Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids. Since the only prerequisite for these studies was that nanoparticles are fluorescently labeled and not of a specific composition or structure, the techniques we present can readily be extended to a wide variety of nanoparticle structures and surface modifications (e.g., shape, charge, hydrophobicity, PEGylation) in the preclinical assessment and tailoring of their hepatotoxicities and clearances.",

Immunosuppressive therapy can reduce the inflammatory state, but resulting infections can expose the patient to greater risk. Using specific immune tolerance organs or tissues from the body, brain antigen immune tolerance treatment can create a minimal immune response to the brain antigens that does not excessively affect the body's immunity. However, commonly used immune tolerance treatment approaches, such as those involving the nasal, gastrointestinal mucosa, thymus or liver portal vein injections, affect the clinical conversion of the therapy due to uncertain drug absorption, or inconvenient routes of administration. If hepatic portal intravenous injections of brain antigens could be replaced by normal peripheral venous infusion, the convenience of immune tolerance treatment could certainly be greatly increased. We attempted to encapsulate brain antigens with minimally immunogenic nanomaterials, to control the sizes of nanoparticles within the range of liver Kupffer cell phagocytosis and to coat the antigens with a coating material that had an affinity for liver cells. We injected these liver drug-loaded nanomaterials via peripheral intravenous injection. With the use of microparticles with liver characteristics, the brain antigens were transported into the liver out of the detection of immune armies in the blood. This approach has been demonstrated in rat models of surgical brain injury. It has been proven that the immune tolerance of brain antigens can be accomplished by peripheral intravenous infusion to achieve the effect of treating brain trauma after operations, which simplifies the clinical operation and could elicit substantial improvements in the future."

They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney.",

Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

ApoE-coated LNPs bind to LDL receptors and allow LNP uptake into hepatocytes.

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes.

Here, we studied a pair of LNPs with similar physical properties and discovered how the chemistry of the ionizable amino lipid can control the endogenous LNP identity, affecting cellular uptake in the liver and altering therapeutic outcomes in a model of liver cancer. Although most LNPs accumulate in the liver after intravenous administration (suggesting that liver delivery is straightforward), we observed an unexpected behavior when comparing two similar LNP formulations (5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 LNPs) that resulted in distinct RNA delivery within the organ. Despite both LNPs possessing similar physical properties, ability to silence gene expression in vitro, strong accumulation within the liver, and a shared pKa of 6.5, only 5A2-SC8 LNPs were able to functionally deliver RNA to hepatocytes. Factor VII (FVII) activity was reduced by 87%, with 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying FVII siRNA (siFVII), while 3A5-SC14 LNPs carrying siFVII produced baseline FVII activity levels comparable to the nontreatment control at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg. Protein corona analysis indicated that 5A2-SC8 LNPs bind apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can drive LDL-R receptor-mediated endocytosis in hepatocytes. In contrast, the surface of 3A5-SC14 LNPs was enriched in albumin but depleted in ApoE, which likely led to Kupffer cell delivery and detargeting of hepatocytes. In an aggressive MYC-driven liver cancer model relevant to hepatocytes, 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying let-7g miRNA were able to significantly extend survival up to 121 days. Since disease targets exist in an organ- and cell-specific manner, the clinical development of RNA LNP therapeutics will require an improved understanding of LNP cellular tropism within organs. The results from our work illustrate the importance of understanding the cellular localization of RNA delivery and incorporating further checkpoints when choosing nanoparticles beyond biochemical and physical characterization, as small changes in the chemical composition of LNPs can have an impact on both the biofate of LNPs and therapeutic outcomes.",

Understanding these cell populations and their properties is crucial for designing lipid nanoparticles with targeted delivery capabilities. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nThe liver is a highly specialized organ with a complex cellular architecture that plays a critical role in nanoparticle interactions and clearance. As the body's primary detoxification center, the liver contains multiple cell populations that differ in their location, function, and surface characteristics, directly influencing how lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) interact with them. Hepatocytes, which constitute approximately 60-80% of liver cells, are the primary functional cells responsible for metabolism and protein synthesis. They are separated from the bloodstream by fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which line the sinusoids and contain nanopores (fenestrations) ranging from 50-150 nm in diameter. These fenestrations allow nanoparticles of appropriate size to access hepatocytes while blocking larger particles. Kupffer cells, the liver-resident macrophages, are located within the sinusoids and represent a major component of the mononuclear phagocyte system, actively recognizing and clearing foreign particles from circulation. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe unique architecture of liver sinusoids, with their fenestrated endothelium lacking a continuous basement membrane, creates a specialized environment that affects nanoparticle distribution. This structure allows for direct contact between the blood and the space of Disse (the area between LSECs and hepatocytes), facilitating the exchange of substances, including appropriately designed nanoparticles. Additionally, the liver sinusoids have a slow blood flow rate and high blood pressure, which increases the contact time between nanoparticles and liver cells, enhancing the probability of cellular interactions and uptake. These physiological characteristics make the liver a primary site for nanoparticle accumulation after intravenous administration, with estimates suggesting that 30-99% of administered nanoparticles end up in the liver depending on their physicochemical properties. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe selective targeting of specific liver cell populations using lipid nanoparticles relies on understanding how modifications to nanoparticle size and surface properties influence their interactions with these distinct cell types. By strategically designing LNPs with specific sizes and surface charges, researchers can enhance delivery to targeted liver cell populations while minimizing uptake by non-target cells, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing off-target effects. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

Sinusoidal endothelial cells might preferentially take up smaller, monodisperse nanoparticles, while Kupffer cells are more likely to interact with larger particles (>100 nm) or aggregated smaller particles. <Paper corpusId=\"260183898\" paperTitle=\"(Ibrahim et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> This size-dependent cellular tropism is further supported by studies showing that nanoparticles smaller than 200 nm accumulate more in the liver, while those larger than 200 nm show greater splenic accumulation. <Paper corpusId=\"3977494\" paperTitle=\"(Germain et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nStrategic manipulation of LNP size can be used to target specific zones within the liver. Smaller LNPs (<100 nm) can access Zone 3 hepatocytes through LSEC fenestrations, while proximity to blood flow facilitates rapid uptake in Zone 1. <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> Some researchers have exploited the dimensions of liver fenestrations to enhance LNP accumulation in cells other than Kupffer cells and LSECs by precisely controlling particle size. <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218480033\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIn summary, the size-dependent distribution of LNPs in the liver is primarily governed by the physical constraints of liver sinusoidal fenestrations, with smaller particles (<100-200 nm) favoring hepatocyte delivery and larger particles promoting uptake by Kupffer cells and LSECs. This understanding enables the rational design of LNPs with sizes tailored to target specific liver cell populations.",

Considering that the particle size did not influence the cellular uptake of RBC-NPs by macrophages, the size-dependent circulation and distribution in the liver might be mainly due to the liver filtration of RBC-NPs."

                            "The liver and spleen are major biological barriers to translating nanomedicines because they sequester the majority of administered nanomaterials and prevent delivery to diseased tissue. Here we examined the blood clearance mechanism of administered hard nanomaterials in relation to blood flow dynamics, organ microarchitecture, and cellular phenotype. We found that nanomaterial velocity reduces 1000-fold as they enter and traverse the liver, leading to 7.5 times more nanomaterial interaction with hepatic cells relative to peripheral cells. In the liver, Kupffer cells (84.8%\u00b16.4%), hepatic B cells (81.5\u00b19.3%), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (64.6\u00b113.7%) interacted with administered PEGylated quantum dots but splenic macrophages took up less (25.4\u00b110.1%) due to differences in phenotype. The uptake patterns were similar for two other nanomaterial types and five different surface chemistries. Potential new strategies to overcome off-target nanomaterial accumulation may involve manipulating intra-organ flow dynamics and modulating cellular phenotype to alter hepatic cell interaction."

                            "Particle size notably affects cell and tissue uptake. Liu et al. observed that nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm were rapidly cleared via renal filtration, resulting in low plaque accumulation (Liu et al., 2018). In the liver, since the diameter of fenestrae in normal liver sinusoid endothelial cells is about 50-200 nm (Cogger et al., 2010)(M\u00f6nkem\u00f6ller et al., 2014), nanoscaled particles with diameters < 200 nm can pass through sinusoids [170]. This is beneficial for nanoparticles to evade capture by Kupffer cells and reach hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells (Hu et al., 2018)(Liu et al., 2014). Nanoparticles with diameters > 400 nm can diffuse through the sinusoid endothelial fenestrations by forced extrusion, presumably owing to transient interaction with the sinusoidal endothelial cells (Romero et al., 1999). As a result, particles with larger size are more likely to be phagocytized by Kupffer cells (Ergen et al., 2017), especially 200-1000 nm (Pietrzak-Nguyen et al., 2014), even microbubbles of ultrasound imaging with the diameters of 1-10 \u00b5m (Yanagisawa et al., 2007)",
                            "The surface charge is also a factor that affects the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. Positively charged particles prefer to be internalized by hepatocyte (Cheng et al., 2012)(Xiao et al., 2011), while Kupffer cells present a greater tendency to ingest nanoparticles with negative charges (Poelstra et al., 2012)."

A number of clinical conditions, especially metabolic and aging-related disorders, are implicated by improper function of LSECs. Despite their importance, research into these cells is limited because the primary ultrastructures involved in their function are transcellular pores, called fenestrations, with diameters in a size range between 50-200 nm, i.e. well below the optical diffraction limit. Here, we show that we are able to resolve fenestrations with a spatial resolution of \u223c20 nm by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). The cellular plasma membrane was labeled at high fluorophore density with CellMask Deep Red and imaged using a reducing buffer system. We compare the higher degree of structural detail that dSTORM provides to results obtained by 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM). Our results open up a path to image these physiologically important cells in vitro using highly resolving localization microscopy techniques that could be implemented on non-specialized fluorescence microscopes, enabling their investigation in most biomedical laboratories without the need for electron microscopy."

For example, LSECs have been shown to engulf particles with a diameter of up to 200 nm due to their internalization method of receptor-mediated endocytosis (Jacobs et al., 2010)[25]. This upper size limit is shown to facilitate intracellular accumulation in late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, an important mechanism for immunomodulation, within other non-phagocytic cells [25]. On the other hand, Kupffer cells, which can also utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis, preferentially uptake particles > 200 nm in the liver due to their phagocytic activity [25](Tian et al., 2019)",

However, it has been shown that nanoparticles up to 400 nm have been able to extravasate into the space of Diss\u00e9 with a proper lipid composition of negatively charged phosphatidylserine (Daemen et al., 1997)",

LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation.\n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood."

The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells (Paunovska et al., 2019).

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most effective in vivo delivery systems for silencing target genes in hepatocytes employing small interfering RNA. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are also potential targets for LNP siRNA. We examined the uptake, intracellular trafficking, and gene silencing potency in primary bone marrow macrophages (bmM\u03a6) and dendritic cells of siRNA formulated in LNPs containing four different ionizable cationic lipids namely DLinDAP, DLinDMA, DLinK-DMA, and DLinKC2-DMA. LNPs containing DLinKC2-DMA were the most potent formulations as determined by their ability to inhibit the production of GAPDH target protein. Also, LNPs containing DLinKC2-DMA were the most potent intracellular delivery agents as indicated by confocal studies of endosomal versus cytoplamic siRNA location using fluorescently labeled siRNA. DLinK-DMA and DLinKC2-DMA formulations exhibited improved gene silencing potencies relative to DLinDMA but were less toxic. In vivo results showed that LNP siRNA systems containing DLinKC2-DMA are effective agents for silencing GAPDH in APCs in the spleen and peritoneal cavity following systemic administration. Gene silencing in APCs was RNAi mediated and the use of larger LNPs resulted in substantially reduced hepatocyte silencing, while similar efficacy was maintained in APCs. These results are discussed with regard to the potential of LNP siRNA formulations to treat immunologically mediated diseases."

                            "A broad spectrum of infectious liver diseases emphasizes the need of microparticles for targeted delivery of immunomodulatory substances to the liver. Microcapsules (MCs) are particularly attractive for innovative drug and vaccine formulations, enabling the combination of antigen, drugs, and adjuvants. The present study aimed to develop microcapsules characterized by an enhanced liver deposition and accelerated uptake by nonparenchymal liver cells (NPCs). Initially, two formulations of biodegradable microcapsules were synthesized from either hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or mannose. Notably, HES-MCs accumulated primarily in the liver, while mannose particles displayed a lung preference. Functionalization of HES-MCs with anti-CD40, anti-DEC205, and/or monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) enhanced uptake of MCs by nonparenchymal liver cells in vitro. In contrast, only MPLA-coated HES-MCs promoted significantly the in vivo uptake by NPCs. Finally, HES-MCs equipped with MPLA, anti-CD40, and anti-DEC205 induced the secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 by Kupffer cells (KCs), and IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12p70 by liver dendritic cells (DCs). The enhanced uptake and activation of KCs by MPLA-HES-MCs is a promising approach to prevent or treat infection, since KCs are exploited as an entry gate in various infectious diseases, such as malaria. In parallel, loading and activating liver DCs, usually prone to tolerance, bears the potential to induce antigen specific, intrahepatic immune responses necessary to prevent and treat infections affecting the liver."

                            "Atherogenesis is associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and its oxidized form (oxLDL) in the blood. The liver is an important scavenger organ for circulating oxLDLs. The present study aimed to examine endocytosis of mildly oxLDL (the major circulating form of oxLDLs) in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the involvement of the scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 in this process. Freshly isolated LSECs, Kupffer cells (KCs), and stabilin-1- and stabilin-2-transfected human embryonic kidney cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled or radiolabeled oxLDLs [oxidized for 3 h (oxLDL(3)), 6 h, or 24 h (oxLDL(24))] to measure endocytosis. The intracellular localization of oxLDLs and stabilins in LSECs was examined by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy. Whereas oxLDL(24) was endocytosed both by LSECs and KCs, oxLDL(3) (mildly oxLDL) was taken up by LSECs only. The LSEC uptake of oxLDLs was significantly inhibited by the scavenger receptor ligand formaldehyde-treated serum albumin. Uptake of all modified LDLs was high in stabilin-1-transfected cells, whereas stabilin-2-transfected cells preferentially took up oxLDL(24), suggesting that stabilin-1 is a more important receptor for mildly oxLDLs than stabilin-2. Double immunogold labeling experiments in LSECs indicated interactions of stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 with oxLDL(3) on the cell surface, in coated pits, and endocytic vesicles. LSECs but not KCs endocytosed mildly oxLDL. Both stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 were involved in the LSEC endocytosis of oxLDLs, but experiments with stabilin-transfected cells pointed to stabilin-1 as the most important receptor for mildly oxLDL."

                            "Kupffer cells phagocytose and destroy pathogens and other foreign objects present in the blood. The uptake and retention rate are highly associated with the nanoparticle's surface charge, size, and ligand chemistry. In vitro study shows that nanoparticles with strong anionic or cationic surface charges will interact with serum protein, forming a protein corona and aggregates, causing an increased interaction with macrophages (Walkey et al., 2012)(Zhang et al., 2016). PEGylated nanoparticles are less efficiently taken by phagocytes. Sinusoidal endothelial cells found lining the vasculature of the liver sinusoid are also involved in innate immunity. It is involved in the elimination of waste macromolecules, including components of connective tissue and hyaluronan from blood circulation by receptor-ligand interactions. Both Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells likely compete for the nanoparticles present in the circulation. In addition, the nanoparticles' physicochemical properties, such as the hydrodynamic size, influence the mechanism of cellular internalization. Nanoparticles with a diameter greater than 100 nm or aggregated nanoparticles lower than 100 nm will have greater interaction with Kupffer cells. In contrast, sinusoidal endothelial cells might take up smaller monodisperse nanoparticles to a higher degree (Zhang et al., 2016)."

                            "Despite tremendous interest in gene therapies, the systemic delivery of nucleic acids still faces substantial challenges. To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

                "text": "\nThe surface charge of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) plays a critical role in determining their cellular tropism within the liver.

This distinct charge-dependent distribution pattern is primarily mediated by differences in receptor expression and cellular recognition mechanisms across liver cell populations. Intravital multiphoton fluorescence microscopy studies revealed significant hepatocyte uptake of positively charged nanoparticles but not negatively charged ones, while negative surface charges promoted rapid uptake by Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids <Paper corpusId=\"2947192\" paperTitle=\"(Cheng et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"266587642\" paperTitle=\"(Kusumoputro et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), their interaction with LNPs is also influenced by surface charge, with LSECs preferentially binding and clearing negatively charged nanoparticles through interactions with scavenger receptors such as stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 <Paper corpusId=\"266587642\" paperTitle=\"(Kusumoputro et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. According to Yan et al., a unique approach to reduce LNP capture by the mononuclear phagocyte system involves designing liposomes with highly negative surface charge (-99.4 mV) and large size (259 nm), which can transiently occupy the reticuloendothelial system and decrease the uptake of subsequently administered therapeutic LNPs by Kupffer cells and LSECs <Paper corpusId=\"264387007\" paperTitle=\"(Yan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218480033\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe composition of LNPs can be strategically manipulated to modify their surface charge and targeting capabilities. Cheng et al. demonstrated that the addition of neutral lipids to LNPs resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the incorporation of cationic lipids into net neutral LNPs shifted distribution toward the lungs, and negatively charged lipids promoted splenic uptake <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"214808084\" paperTitle=\"(Cheng et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, incorporating oxidized cholesterol into LNPs redirected uptake away from hepatocytes toward Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSurface modifications such as PEGylation can also significantly alter the charge-dependent distribution of LNPs. PEGylation increases the stability and circulation time of LNPs while preventing opsonization, thereby reducing recognition and clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system <Paper corpusId=\"198171187\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7237750\" paperTitle=\"(Milla et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. Research indicates that PEGylated nanoparticles are less efficiently taken up by phagocytes, potentially enhancing their delivery to hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"260183898\" paperTitle=\"(Ibrahim et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor optimal hepatocyte targeting, Witzigmann et al. suggest that LNPs should possess a slightly negative surface charge to prevent sequestration in the lungs (which occurs with positively charged particles) or rapid clearance by cells expressing scavenger receptors (which occurs with excessively negative charges) <Paper corpusId=\"198171187\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. An ideal LNP for hepatocyte gene regulation should have a near-neutral surface charge, along with other characteristics such as a nanoparticle size <80 nm and an appropriate ionizable cationic lipid pKa value <Paper corpusId=\"220281961\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn summary, surface charge represents a key design parameter that can be strategically manipulated to direct LNPs to specific liver cell populations. Positive charges favor hepatocyte targeting, negative charges promote uptake by Kupffer cells and LSECs, and near-neutral charges with appropriate size can enhance overall liver delivery while minimizing undesired clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system.",

                            "Particle size notably affects cell and tissue uptake. Liu et al. observed that nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm were rapidly cleared via renal filtration, resulting in low plaque accumulation (Liu et al., 2018). In the liver, since the diameter of fenestrae in normal liver sinusoid endothelial cells is about 50-200 nm (Cogger et al., 2010)(M\u00f6nkem\u00f6ller et al., 2014), nanoscaled particles with diameters < 200 nm can pass through sinusoids [170]. This is beneficial for nanoparticles to evade capture by Kupffer cells and reach hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells (Hu et al., 2018)(Liu et al., 2014). Nanoparticles with diameters > 400 nm can diffuse through the sinusoid endothelial fenestrations by forced extrusion, presumably owing to transient interaction with the sinusoidal endothelial cells (Romero et al., 1999). As a result, particles with larger size are more likely to be phagocytized by Kupffer cells (Ergen et al., 2017), especially 200-1000 nm (Pietrzak-Nguyen et al., 2014), even microbubbles of ultrasound imaging with the diameters of 1-10 \u00b5m (Yanagisawa et al., 2007)",
                            "The surface charge is also a factor that affects the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. Positively charged particles prefer to be internalized by hepatocyte (Cheng et al., 2012)(Xiao et al., 2011), while Kupffer cells present a greater tendency to ingest nanoparticles with negative charges (Poelstra et al., 2012)."

In this work, we report the first application of intravital multiphoton fluorescence microscopy to dynamically track the hepatic metabolism of nanoparticles with subcellular resolution in real time. Using fluorescently labeled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) in mice as a prototypical model, we observed significant hepatocyte uptake of positively charged, but not negatively charged, moieties. Conversely, in vivo imaging of negatively charged, but not positively charged, MSNs reveals an overwhelming propensity for the former's rapid uptake by Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids. Since the only prerequisite for these studies was that nanoparticles are fluorescently labeled and not of a specific composition or structure, the techniques we present can readily be extended to a wide variety of nanoparticle structures and surface modifications (e.g., shape, charge, hydrophobicity, PEGylation) in the preclinical assessment and tailoring of their hepatotoxicities and clearances."

                            "Specific liver-residing cells also display particle size preferences due to the impact of size on cellular internalization rates and mechanisms. For example, LSECs have been shown to engulf particles with a diameter of up to 200 nm due to their internalization method of receptor-mediated endocytosis (Jacobs et al., 2010)[25]. This upper size limit is shown to facilitate intracellular accumulation in late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, an important mechanism for immunomodulation, within other non-phagocytic cells [25]. On the other hand, Kupffer cells, which can also utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis, preferentially uptake particles > 200 nm in the liver due to their phagocytic activity [25](Tian et al., 2019)",
                            "To access other liver cells, such as hepatocytes and HSCs, penetration through the liver sinusoidal fenestrae via the space of Diss\u00e9 may require minimization of nanoparticle size, ideally to <100 nm (Wisse et al., 1985). However, it has been shown that nanoparticles up to 400 nm have been able to extravasate into the space of Diss\u00e9 with a proper lipid composition of negatively charged phosphatidylserine (Daemen et al., 1997)",
                            "Kupffer cells and LSECs have also been shown to preferentially bind and clear negatively charged nanoparticles through interactions with scavenger receptors, such as stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 (Arias-Alpizar et al., 2021)(Cheng et al., 2012). Conversely, hepatocytes demonstrate significant uptake of positively charged NPs over negatively charged ones (Cheng et al., 2012)."

                            "Despite tremendous interest in gene therapies, the systemic delivery of nucleic acids still faces substantial challenges. To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake (Cheng et al., 2020). The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells (Paunovska et al., 2019). The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells (Gan et al., 2020)."

                            "CRISPR\u2013Cas gene editing and messenger RNA-based protein replacement therapy hold tremendous potential to effectively treat disease-causing mutations with diverse cellular origin. However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

                            "Using mRNA to produce therapeutic proteins is a promising approach to treat genetic diseases. However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

The surface charge (i.e. z potential) should be slightly negative (Xiao et al., 2011) to prevent sequestration of particles in the lung (i.e. due to a positive charge) (Ishiwata et al., 2000) or rapid clearance by cells expressing scavenger receptors (i.e. due to an excessive negative charge) (Rothkopf et al., 2005). According to the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory of colloids, a neutral charge has to be avoided to prevent particle agglomeration. In addition to surface charge, steric stabilization by PEGylation mediates long circulating properties and prevents opsonization (Karmali et al., 2011)(Milla et al., 2012)."

                            "PEGylation is one of the most successful strategies to improve the delivery of therapeutic molecules such as proteins, macromolecular carriers, small drugs, oligonucleotides, and other biomolecules. PEGylation increase the size and molecular weight of conjugated biomolecules and improves their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodinamics by increasing water solubility, protecting from enzymatic degradation, reducing renal clearance and limiting immunogenic and antigenic reactions. PEGylated molecules show increased half-life, decreased plasma clearance, and different biodistribution, in comparison with non-PEGylated counterparts. These features appear to be very useful for therapeutic proteins, since the high stability and very low immunogenicity of PEGylated proteins result in sustained clinical response with minimal dose and less frequent administration. PEGylation of liposomes improves not only the stability and circulation time, but also the 'passive' targeting ability on tumoral tissues, through a process known as the enhanced permeation retention effect, able to improve the therapeutic effects and reduce the toxicity of encapsulated drug. The molecular weight, shape, reactivity, specificity, and type of bond of PEG moiety are crucial in determining the effect on PEGylated molecules and, at present, researchers have the chance to select among tens of PEG derivatives and PEG conjugation technologies, in order to design the best PEGylation strategy for each particular application. The aim of the present review will be to elucidate the principles of PEGylation chemistry and to describe the already marketed PEGylated proteins and liposomes by focusing our attention to some enlightening examples of how this technology could dramatically influence the clinical application of therapeutic biomolecules."

The uptake and retention rate are highly associated with the nanoparticle's surface charge, size, and ligand chemistry. In vitro study shows that nanoparticles with strong anionic or cationic surface charges will interact with serum protein, forming a protein corona and aggregates, causing an increased interaction with macrophages (Walkey et al., 2012)(Zhang et al., 2016). PEGylated nanoparticles are less efficiently taken by phagocytes. Sinusoidal endothelial cells found lining the vasculature of the liver sinusoid are also involved in innate immunity. It is involved in the elimination of waste macromolecules, including components of connective tissue and hyaluronan from blood circulation by receptor-ligand interactions. Both Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells likely compete for the nanoparticles present in the circulation. In addition, the nanoparticles' physicochemical properties, such as the hydrodynamic size, influence the mechanism of cellular internalization. Nanoparticles with a diameter greater than 100 nm or aggregated nanoparticles lower than 100 nm will have greater interaction with Kupffer cells. In contrast, sinusoidal endothelial cells might take up smaller monodisperse nanoparticles to a higher degree (Zhang et al., 2016)."

Liu et al. observed that nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm were rapidly cleared via renal filtration, resulting in low plaque accumulation (Liu et al., 2018). In the liver, since the diameter of fenestrae in normal liver sinusoid endothelial cells is about 50-200 nm (Cogger et al., 2010)(M\u00f6nkem\u00f6ller et al., 2014), nanoscaled particles with diameters < 200 nm can pass through sinusoids [170]. This is beneficial for nanoparticles to evade capture by Kupffer cells and reach hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells (Hu et al., 2018)(Liu et al., 2014). Nanoparticles with diameters > 400 nm can diffuse through the sinusoid endothelial fenestrations by forced extrusion, presumably owing to transient interaction with the sinusoidal endothelial cells (Romero et al., 1999). As a result, particles with larger size are more likely to be phagocytized by Kupffer cells (Ergen et al., 2017), especially 200-1000 nm (Pietrzak-Nguyen et al., 2014), even microbubbles of ultrasound imaging with the diameters of 1-10 \u00b5m (Yanagisawa et al., 2007)",
                            "The surface charge is also a factor that affects the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. Positively charged particles prefer to be internalized by hepatocyte (Cheng et al., 2012)(Xiao et al., 2011), while Kupffer cells present a greater tendency to ingest nanoparticles with negative charges (Poelstra et al., 2012)."

For example, LSECs have been shown to engulf particles with a diameter of up to 200 nm due to their internalization method of receptor-mediated endocytosis (Jacobs et al., 2010)[25]. This upper size limit is shown to facilitate intracellular accumulation in late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, an important mechanism for immunomodulation, within other non-phagocytic cells [25]. On the other hand, Kupffer cells, which can also utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis, preferentially uptake particles > 200 nm in the liver due to their phagocytic activity [25](Tian et al., 2019)",

                            "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are an important class of endothelial cells facilitating the translocation of lipoproteins and small molecules between the liver and blood. A number of clinical conditions, especially metabolic and aging-related disorders, are implicated by improper function of LSECs. Despite their importance, research into these cells is limited because the primary ultrastructures involved in their function are transcellular pores, called fenestrations, with diameters in a size range between 50-200 nm, i.e. well below the optical diffraction limit. Here, we show that we are able to resolve fenestrations with a spatial resolution of \u223c20 nm by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). The cellular plasma membrane was labeled at high fluorophore density with CellMask Deep Red and imaged using a reducing buffer system. We compare the higher degree of structural detail that dSTORM provides to results obtained by 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM). Our results open up a path to image these physiologically important cells in vitro using highly resolving localization microscopy techniques that could be implemented on non-specialized fluorescence microscopes, enabling their investigation in most biomedical laboratories without the need for electron microscopy."

The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells (Paunovska et al., 2019).

Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are also potential targets for LNP siRNA. We examined the uptake, intracellular trafficking, and gene silencing potency in primary bone marrow macrophages (bmM\u03a6) and dendritic cells of siRNA formulated in LNPs containing four different ionizable cationic lipids namely DLinDAP, DLinDMA, DLinK-DMA, and DLinKC2-DMA. LNPs containing DLinKC2-DMA were the most potent formulations as determined by their ability to inhibit the production of GAPDH target protein. Also, LNPs containing DLinKC2-DMA were the most potent intracellular delivery agents as indicated by confocal studies of endosomal versus cytoplamic siRNA location using fluorescently labeled siRNA. DLinK-DMA and DLinKC2-DMA formulations exhibited improved gene silencing potencies relative to DLinDMA but were less toxic. In vivo results showed that LNP siRNA systems containing DLinKC2-DMA are effective agents for silencing GAPDH in APCs in the spleen and peritoneal cavity following systemic administration. Gene silencing in APCs was RNAi mediated and the use of larger LNPs resulted in substantially reduced hepatocyte silencing, while similar efficacy was maintained in APCs. These results are discussed with regard to the potential of LNP siRNA formulations to treat immunologically mediated diseases."

                            "Nanoparticles that do not undergo renal excretion or in vivo degradation into biocompatible debris often accumulate in the reticuloendothelial system, also know as the mononuclear phagocyte system, with undesired consequences that limit their clinical utility. In this work, we report the first application of intravital multiphoton fluorescence microscopy to dynamically track the hepatic metabolism of nanoparticles with subcellular resolution in real time. Using fluorescently labeled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) in mice as a prototypical model, we observed significant hepatocyte uptake of positively charged, but not negatively charged, moieties. Conversely, in vivo imaging of negatively charged, but not positively charged, MSNs reveals an overwhelming propensity for the former's rapid uptake by Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids. Since the only prerequisite for these studies was that nanoparticles are fluorescently labeled and not of a specific composition or structure, the techniques we present can readily be extended to a wide variety of nanoparticle structures and surface modifications (e.g., shape, charge, hydrophobicity, PEGylation) in the preclinical assessment and tailoring of their hepatotoxicities and clearances."

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes (Yu et al., 2004). LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs (Sato et al., 2016). Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs (Sato et al., 2016)",

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation.\n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood."

                            "Within the field of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for RNA delivery, the focus has been mainly placed on organ level delivery, which can mask cellular level effects consequential to therapeutic applications. Here, we studied a pair of LNPs with similar physical properties and discovered how the chemistry of the ionizable amino lipid can control the endogenous LNP identity, affecting cellular uptake in the liver and altering therapeutic outcomes in a model of liver cancer. Although most LNPs accumulate in the liver after intravenous administration (suggesting that liver delivery is straightforward), we observed an unexpected behavior when comparing two similar LNP formulations (5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 LNPs) that resulted in distinct RNA delivery within the organ. Despite both LNPs possessing similar physical properties, ability to silence gene expression in vitro, strong accumulation within the liver, and a shared pKa of 6.5, only 5A2-SC8 LNPs were able to functionally deliver RNA to hepatocytes. Factor VII (FVII) activity was reduced by 87%, with 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying FVII siRNA (siFVII), while 3A5-SC14 LNPs carrying siFVII produced baseline FVII activity levels comparable to the nontreatment control at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg. Protein corona analysis indicated that 5A2-SC8 LNPs bind apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can drive LDL-R receptor-mediated endocytosis in hepatocytes. In contrast, the surface of 3A5-SC14 LNPs was enriched in albumin but depleted in ApoE, which likely led to Kupffer cell delivery and detargeting of hepatocytes. In an aggressive MYC-driven liver cancer model relevant to hepatocytes, 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying let-7g miRNA were able to significantly extend survival up to 121 days. Since disease targets exist in an organ- and cell-specific manner, the clinical development of RNA LNP therapeutics will require an improved understanding of LNP cellular tropism within organs. The results from our work illustrate the importance of understanding the cellular localization of RNA delivery and incorporating further checkpoints when choosing nanoparticles beyond biochemical and physical characterization, as small changes in the chemical composition of LNPs can have an impact on both the biofate of LNPs and therapeutic outcomes."

EL in both mouse and rat liver was colocalized with vascular endothelial cells but not with hepatocytes. In contrast, HL was present in both hepatocytes and endothelial cells. By in situ hybridization, EL mRNA was present only in endothelial cells in liver sections. EL was also present at low levels in aorta of normal mice. We fed EKO mice and wild-type mice a variety of diets and determined EL expression in liver and aorta. EKO mice showed significant expression of EL in aorta. EL expression was lower in the liver of EKO mice than in normal mice. Cholesterol feeding decreased EL in liver of both types of mice. In the aorta, EL was higher in EKO than in wild-type mice, and cholesterol feeding had no effect. Together, these data suggest that EL may be upregulated at the site of atherosclerotic lesions and thus could supply lipids to the area."

                "text": "\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) represent a distinct target population within the liver that can be selectively accessed through strategic manipulation of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) properties. Unlike hepatocyte targeting, which benefits from smaller particle sizes, research has demonstrated that increasing LNP size can significantly improve LSEC-specific gene silencing. <Paper corpusId=\"205208610\" paperTitle=\"(Sato et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> This size-dependent targeting aligns with the physiological characteristics of LSECs, which possess the highest endocytic capacity among liver cells and lack a basement membrane, making them highly permeable and efficient at clearing larger particles from circulation. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe fenestrated structure of LSECs plays a critical role in determining which nanoparticles reach hepatocytes versus those captured by LSECs. Since the average diameter of liver fenestrae is approximately 100 nm in humans and 140 nm in mice, nanoparticles exceeding these dimensions cannot pass through to reach hepatocytes and are instead taken up by LSECs and Kupffer cells. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9252371\" paperTitle=\"(Braet et al., 2002)\" isShortName></Paper> Some researchers have exploited this architectural feature to enhance LNP accumulation in non-hepatocyte liver cells by precisely controlling particle size. <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218480033\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nSurface charge significantly influences LSEC targeting, with negatively charged LNPs showing preferential uptake by these cells. This preference is mediated by scavenger receptors such as stabilin-1 and stabilin-2, which are highly expressed on LSECs and recognize anionic particles. <Paper corpusId=\"257862241\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"1167389\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper> The importance of surface charge in controlling organ-specific delivery has been well-documented, with studies showing that it dramatically affects LNP biodistribution. <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"214808084\" paperTitle=\"(Cheng et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe chemical composition of LNPs also plays a crucial role in determining LSEC selectivity. For example, LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol deliver mRNA preferentially to cells in the liver microenvironment, including LSECs and Kupffer cells, rather than hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"257862241\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> Similarly, LNPs containing phosphatidylglycerol accumulate predominantly in LSECs and Kupffer cells, while phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs distribute more evenly among hepatocytes, LSECs, and Kupffer cells. <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe pKa value of ionizable lipids in LNP formulations significantly influences cellular tropism within the liver. Research has shown that increasing the pKa from 6.50 (YSK05-LNP) to 7.15 (YSK05/12-LNP) dramatically shifts distribution from hepatocytes to LSECs, with only traces of the higher-pKa formulation reaching hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"56895022\" paperTitle=\"(Shobaki et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> This precise tuning of ionizable lipid pKa provides a powerful tool for controlling LSEC-specific targeting.\n\nActive targeting approaches using specific ligands have also proven effective for enhancing LSEC selectivity. Kim et al. demonstrated that incorporating mannose into LNPs allowed for selective RNA delivery to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> This approach leverages the high expression of mannose receptors on LSECs to achieve targeted delivery.\n\nInterestingly, studies have revealed heterogeneity in LNP interactions even within endothelial cell subtypes. For instance, CD32Low cells (periportal zone) exhibit higher LNP accumulation compared to CD32High cells (central venous zone). <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252544644\" paperTitle=\"(Johnson et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> Additionally, while both 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 LNP formulations show similar physical properties, 5A2-SC8 enhances ApoE-mediated hepatocyte delivery, whereas 3A5-SC14 favors Kupffer cell uptake, demonstrating how subtle chemical differences can significantly impact cellular targeting. <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nFunctional mRNA delivery efficiency also varies among liver cell populations, with studies showing notably higher delivery to liver endothelial cells compared to Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> This finding suggests that LSECs may be particularly receptive to LNP-mediated RNA delivery, making them promising targets for therapeutic interventions.",

LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation.\n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood."

Kim et al. (Kim et al., 2021) show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. (Saunders et al., 2020) exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically (Tsoi et al., 2016)",

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

                            "Atherogenesis is associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and its oxidized form (oxLDL) in the blood. The liver is an important scavenger organ for circulating oxLDLs. The present study aimed to examine endocytosis of mildly oxLDL (the major circulating form of oxLDLs) in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the involvement of the scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 in this process. Freshly isolated LSECs, Kupffer cells (KCs), and stabilin-1- and stabilin-2-transfected human embryonic kidney cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled or radiolabeled oxLDLs [oxidized for 3 h (oxLDL(3)), 6 h, or 24 h (oxLDL(24))] to measure endocytosis. The intracellular localization of oxLDLs and stabilins in LSECs was examined by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy. Whereas oxLDL(24) was endocytosed both by LSECs and KCs, oxLDL(3) (mildly oxLDL) was taken up by LSECs only. The LSEC uptake of oxLDLs was significantly inhibited by the scavenger receptor ligand formaldehyde-treated serum albumin. Uptake of all modified LDLs was high in stabilin-1-transfected cells, whereas stabilin-2-transfected cells preferentially took up oxLDL(24), suggesting that stabilin-1 is a more important receptor for mildly oxLDLs than stabilin-2. Double immunogold labeling experiments in LSECs indicated interactions of stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 with oxLDL(3) on the cell surface, in coated pits, and endocytic vesicles. LSECs but not KCs endocytosed mildly oxLDL. Both stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 were involved in the LSEC endocytosis of oxLDLs, but experiments with stabilin-transfected cells pointed to stabilin-1 as the most important receptor for mildly oxLDL."

                            "CRISPR\u2013Cas gene editing and messenger RNA-based protein replacement therapy hold tremendous potential to effectively treat disease-causing mutations with diverse cellular origin. However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

                            "Using mRNA to produce therapeutic proteins is a promising approach to treat genetic diseases. However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

                            "Within the field of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for RNA delivery, the focus has been mainly placed on organ level delivery, which can mask cellular level effects consequential to therapeutic applications. Here, we studied a pair of LNPs with similar physical properties and discovered how the chemistry of the ionizable amino lipid can control the endogenous LNP identity, affecting cellular uptake in the liver and altering therapeutic outcomes in a model of liver cancer. Although most LNPs accumulate in the liver after intravenous administration (suggesting that liver delivery is straightforward), we observed an unexpected behavior when comparing two similar LNP formulations (5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 LNPs) that resulted in distinct RNA delivery within the organ. Despite both LNPs possessing similar physical properties, ability to silence gene expression in vitro, strong accumulation within the liver, and a shared pKa of 6.5, only 5A2-SC8 LNPs were able to functionally deliver RNA to hepatocytes. Factor VII (FVII) activity was reduced by 87%, with 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying FVII siRNA (siFVII), while 3A5-SC14 LNPs carrying siFVII produced baseline FVII activity levels comparable to the nontreatment control at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg. Protein corona analysis indicated that 5A2-SC8 LNPs bind apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can drive LDL-R receptor-mediated endocytosis in hepatocytes. In contrast, the surface of 3A5-SC14 LNPs was enriched in albumin but depleted in ApoE, which likely led to Kupffer cell delivery and detargeting of hepatocytes. In an aggressive MYC-driven liver cancer model relevant to hepatocytes, 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying let-7g miRNA were able to significantly extend survival up to 121 days. Since disease targets exist in an organ- and cell-specific manner, the clinical development of RNA LNP therapeutics will require an improved understanding of LNP cellular tropism within organs. The results from our work illustrate the importance of understanding the cellular localization of RNA delivery and incorporating further checkpoints when choosing nanoparticles beyond biochemical and physical characterization, as small changes in the chemical composition of LNPs can have an impact on both the biofate of LNPs and therapeutic outcomes."

                "text": "\nKupffer cells, as specialized liver-resident macrophages, have distinct preferences for nanoparticle uptake that can be exploited for selective targeting. Particle size plays a crucial role in determining Kupffer cell tropism, with larger particles (>200 nm) showing enhanced uptake by these phagocytic cells. Specifically, particles in the 200-1000 nm range are more readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells <Paper corpusId=\"228872521\" paperTitle=\"(Jin et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"8137674\" paperTitle=\"(Pietrzak-Nguyen et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This size-dependent uptake is partly due to the structural features of liver sinusoids, where smaller particles (<200 nm) can pass through fenestrations in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells to reach hepatocytes, while larger particles are more likely intercepted by Kupffer cells <Paper corpusId=\"228872521\" paperTitle=\"(Jin et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Even microbubbles used for ultrasound imaging with diameters of 1-10 \u03bcm show significant Kupffer cell uptake <Paper corpusId=\"228872521\" paperTitle=\"(Jin et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSurface charge significantly influences Kupffer cell targeting, with negatively charged nanoparticles demonstrating a greater tendency to be ingested by these cells <Paper corpusId=\"228872521\" paperTitle=\"(Jin et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"2947192\" paperTitle=\"(Cheng et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. Intravital multiphoton fluorescence microscopy has confirmed that negatively charged nanoparticles are rapidly taken up by Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids, while positively charged particles preferentially accumulate in hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"2947192\" paperTitle=\"(Cheng et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. This differential uptake pattern is attributed to the expression of specific receptors on Kupffer cells that recognize and bind negatively charged particles.\n\nThe lipid composition of nanoparticles also plays a crucial role in determining their cellular tropism within the liver. Remarkably, the incorporation of oxidized cholesterol into LNPs shifts liver uptake away from hepatocytes and toward Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, researchers have demonstrated that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells, at doses as low as 0.05 mg/kg <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. The structure of the oxidized cholesterol significantly affects targeting ability, with modifications on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D outperforming modifications on sterol ring B <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSimilarly, LNPs containing phosphatidylglycerol accumulate predominantly in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, in contrast to phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs, which distribute more evenly among hepatocytes, LSECs, and Kupffer cells <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The incorporation of constrained lipids, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218998732\" paperTitle=\"(Gan et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInterestingly, some LNP formulations demonstrate different targeting behaviors despite having similar physical properties. For example, while both 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 LNP formulations have similar physical characteristics, 5A2-SC8 enhances ApoE-mediated hepatocyte delivery, whereas 3A5-SC14 favors Kupffer cell uptake <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252544644\" paperTitle=\"(Johnson et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This difference is attributed to the LNPs' protein corona composition, with 3A5-SC14 being enriched in albumin but depleted in ApoE, which likely leads to Kupffer cell delivery and detargeting of hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"252544644\" paperTitle=\"(Johnson et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNovel approaches to enhance Kupffer cell targeting include strategies to manipulate the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Saunders et al. designed liposomes with highly negative surface charge (-99.4 mV) and large size (259 nm) that transiently occupy the MPS, decreasing the uptake of subsequently administered therapeutic LNPs by Kupffer cells and LSECs <Paper corpusId=\"264387007\" paperTitle=\"(Yan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218480033\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach demonstrates how strategic manipulation of LNP properties can be used to modulate Kupffer cell interactions.\n\nCompetition between liver cell types for nanoparticle uptake also influences targeting efficiency. While sinusoidal endothelial cells might preferentially take up smaller, monodisperse nanoparticles, Kupffer cells are more likely to interact with larger particles (>100 nm) or aggregated smaller particles <Paper corpusId=\"260183898\" paperTitle=\"(Ibrahim et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This understanding of competitive uptake mechanisms can inform the design of LNPs for selective Kupffer cell targeting.",

                            "Particle size notably affects cell and tissue uptake. Liu et al. observed that nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm were rapidly cleared via renal filtration, resulting in low plaque accumulation (Liu et al., 2018). In the liver, since the diameter of fenestrae in normal liver sinusoid endothelial cells is about 50-200 nm (Cogger et al., 2010)(M\u00f6nkem\u00f6ller et al., 2014), nanoscaled particles with diameters < 200 nm can pass through sinusoids [170]. This is beneficial for nanoparticles to evade capture by Kupffer cells and reach hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells (Hu et al., 2018)(Liu et al., 2014). Nanoparticles with diameters > 400 nm can diffuse through the sinusoid endothelial fenestrations by forced extrusion, presumably owing to transient interaction with the sinusoidal endothelial cells (Romero et al., 1999). As a result, particles with larger size are more likely to be phagocytized by Kupffer cells (Ergen et al., 2017), especially 200-1000 nm (Pietrzak-Nguyen et al., 2014), even microbubbles of ultrasound imaging with the diameters of 1-10 \u00b5m (Yanagisawa et al., 2007)",
                            "The surface charge is also a factor that affects the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. Positively charged particles prefer to be internalized by hepatocyte (Cheng et al., 2012)(Xiao et al., 2011), while Kupffer cells present a greater tendency to ingest nanoparticles with negative charges (Poelstra et al., 2012)."

                            "A broad spectrum of infectious liver diseases emphasizes the need of microparticles for targeted delivery of immunomodulatory substances to the liver. Microcapsules (MCs) are particularly attractive for innovative drug and vaccine formulations, enabling the combination of antigen, drugs, and adjuvants. The present study aimed to develop microcapsules characterized by an enhanced liver deposition and accelerated uptake by nonparenchymal liver cells (NPCs). Initially, two formulations of biodegradable microcapsules were synthesized from either hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or mannose. Notably, HES-MCs accumulated primarily in the liver, while mannose particles displayed a lung preference. Functionalization of HES-MCs with anti-CD40, anti-DEC205, and/or monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) enhanced uptake of MCs by nonparenchymal liver cells in vitro. In contrast, only MPLA-coated HES-MCs promoted significantly the in vivo uptake by NPCs. Finally, HES-MCs equipped with MPLA, anti-CD40, and anti-DEC205 induced the secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 by Kupffer cells (KCs), and IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12p70 by liver dendritic cells (DCs). The enhanced uptake and activation of KCs by MPLA-HES-MCs is a promising approach to prevent or treat infection, since KCs are exploited as an entry gate in various infectious diseases, such as malaria. In parallel, loading and activating liver DCs, usually prone to tolerance, bears the potential to induce antigen specific, intrahepatic immune responses necessary to prevent and treat infections affecting the liver."

                            "Nanoparticles that do not undergo renal excretion or in vivo degradation into biocompatible debris often accumulate in the reticuloendothelial system, also know as the mononuclear phagocyte system, with undesired consequences that limit their clinical utility. In this work, we report the first application of intravital multiphoton fluorescence microscopy to dynamically track the hepatic metabolism of nanoparticles with subcellular resolution in real time. Using fluorescently labeled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) in mice as a prototypical model, we observed significant hepatocyte uptake of positively charged, but not negatively charged, moieties. Conversely, in vivo imaging of negatively charged, but not positively charged, MSNs reveals an overwhelming propensity for the former's rapid uptake by Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids. Since the only prerequisite for these studies was that nanoparticles are fluorescently labeled and not of a specific composition or structure, the techniques we present can readily be extended to a wide variety of nanoparticle structures and surface modifications (e.g., shape, charge, hydrophobicity, PEGylation) in the preclinical assessment and tailoring of their hepatotoxicities and clearances."

The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells (Paunovska et al., 2019).

However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can deliver mRNA to hepatocytes in humans, yet systemic non\u2010hepatocyte delivery at clinical doses remains difficult. We noted that LNPs have historically been formulated with phospholipids containing unconstrained alkyl tails. Based on evidence that constrained adamantyl groups have unique properties that can improve small molecule drug delivery, we hypothesized that a phospholipid containing an adamantyl group would facilitate mRNA delivery in vivo. We quantified how 109 LNPs containing \"constrained phospholipids\" delivered mRNA to 16 cell types in mice, then using a DNA barcoding\u2010based analytical pipeline, related phospholipid structure to in vivo delivery. By analyzing delivery mediated by constrained phospholipids, we identified a novel LNP that delivers mRNA to immune cells at 0.5 mg/kg. Unlike many previous LNPs, these (a) did not preferentially target hepatocytes and (b) delivered mRNA to immune cells without targeting ligands. These data suggest constrained phospholipids may be useful LNP components."

                            "Within the field of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for RNA delivery, the focus has been mainly placed on organ level delivery, which can mask cellular level effects consequential to therapeutic applications. Here, we studied a pair of LNPs with similar physical properties and discovered how the chemistry of the ionizable amino lipid can control the endogenous LNP identity, affecting cellular uptake in the liver and altering therapeutic outcomes in a model of liver cancer. Although most LNPs accumulate in the liver after intravenous administration (suggesting that liver delivery is straightforward), we observed an unexpected behavior when comparing two similar LNP formulations (5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 LNPs) that resulted in distinct RNA delivery within the organ. Despite both LNPs possessing similar physical properties, ability to silence gene expression in vitro, strong accumulation within the liver, and a shared pKa of 6.5, only 5A2-SC8 LNPs were able to functionally deliver RNA to hepatocytes. Factor VII (FVII) activity was reduced by 87%, with 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying FVII siRNA (siFVII), while 3A5-SC14 LNPs carrying siFVII produced baseline FVII activity levels comparable to the nontreatment control at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg. Protein corona analysis indicated that 5A2-SC8 LNPs bind apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can drive LDL-R receptor-mediated endocytosis in hepatocytes. In contrast, the surface of 3A5-SC14 LNPs was enriched in albumin but depleted in ApoE, which likely led to Kupffer cell delivery and detargeting of hepatocytes. In an aggressive MYC-driven liver cancer model relevant to hepatocytes, 5A2-SC8 LNPs carrying let-7g miRNA were able to significantly extend survival up to 121 days. Since disease targets exist in an organ- and cell-specific manner, the clinical development of RNA LNP therapeutics will require an improved understanding of LNP cellular tropism within organs. The results from our work illustrate the importance of understanding the cellular localization of RNA delivery and incorporating further checkpoints when choosing nanoparticles beyond biochemical and physical characterization, as small changes in the chemical composition of LNPs can have an impact on both the biofate of LNPs and therapeutic outcomes."

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs' uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics."

In vitro study shows that nanoparticles with strong anionic or cationic surface charges will interact with serum protein, forming a protein corona and aggregates, causing an increased interaction with macrophages (Walkey et al., 2012)(Zhang et al., 2016). PEGylated nanoparticles are less efficiently taken by phagocytes. Sinusoidal endothelial cells found lining the vasculature of the liver sinusoid are also involved in innate immunity. It is involved in the elimination of waste macromolecules, including components of connective tissue and hyaluronan from blood circulation by receptor-ligand interactions. Both Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells likely compete for the nanoparticles present in the circulation. In addition, the nanoparticles' physicochemical properties, such as the hydrodynamic size, influence the mechanism of cellular internalization. Nanoparticles with a diameter greater than 100 nm or aggregated nanoparticles lower than 100 nm will have greater interaction with Kupffer cells. In contrast, sinusoidal endothelial cells might take up smaller monodisperse nanoparticles to a higher degree (Zhang et al., 2016)."
