The recombinant DNA technology and heterologous protein expression have helped simplify the isolation of targeted polypeptides at high purity and their structure-function examinations. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli, the most-established heterologous host organism, has been widely used to produce proteins of commercial and fundamental research interests. Nonetheless, many peptides/proteins are still difficult to express due to their ability to slow down cell growth or disrupt cellular metabolism. Besides, special modifications are often required for proper folding and activity of targeted proteins. The cell-free (CF) or in vitro recombinant protein synthesis system enables the production of such difficult-to-obtain molecules since it is possible to adjust reaction medium and there is no need to support cellular metabolism and viability. Here, we describe E. coli-based CF systems, the optimization steps done toward the development of highly productive and cost-effective CF methodology, and the modification of an in vitro approach required for difficult-to-obtain protein production.",

The advantages of E. coli as an organism for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known and rely on simplicity, fast growth, and cost-effective procedures of cell cultivation and protein extraction. Despite the availability of diverse E. coli strains, a variety of expression plasmids, and the number of approaches developed to produce different recombinant peptides and proteins [1,2], the application of such a heterologous host is still limited or not even possible for a broad range of peptides and proteins. The examples of difficult-to-obtain proteins include eukaryotic ones, whose synthesis requires codon optimization or post-translational modification, disulfide-bonded, toxic and integral membrane peptides and proteins. Moreover, screening for optimal strategy for the desired protein synthesis can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. \n\nSince it has been identified that protein synthesis is a ribosome-mediated process [3] that does not require the integrity of the cell [4], cell-free (CF) or in vitro protein synthesis is considered a good alternative for recombinant protein production. The productivity of cell-free expression systems has been greatly improved and in vitro methodology has been used for a variety of applications. The CF protein synthesis systems are generally constructed with cell extract prepared from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, or rabbit reticulocytes. The E. coli extract-based CF expression system is the most popular, and broad varieties of in vitro protein synthesis systems are commercialized by various companies (e.g., Biotechrabbit, Invitrogen, Qiagen, Promega), and have been used for a range of applications. \n\nThe CF protein synthesis system has several advantages over current in vivo processes. Firstly, since there is no need to support cellular metabolism; all of the cellular resources can be efficiently directed toward the production of a single protein [5].",

Nonetheless, many peptides/proteins are still difficult to express due to their ability to slow down cell growth or disrupt cellular metabolism. Besides, special modifications are often required for proper folding and activity of targeted proteins. The cell-free (CF) or in vitro recombinant protein synthesis system enables the production of such difficult-to-obtain molecules since it is possible to adjust reaction medium and there is no need to support cellular metabolism and viability. Here, we describe E. coli-based CF systems, the optimization steps done toward the development of highly productive and cost-effective CF methodology, and the modification of an in vitro approach required for difficult-to-obtain protein production.\n## Introduction\nEscherichia coli is considered as a first-choice heterologous host organism for the expression of recombinant protein. The advantages of E. coli as an organism for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known and rely on simplicity, fast growth, and cost-effective procedures of cell cultivation and protein extraction. Despite the availability of diverse E. coli strains, a variety of expression plasmids, and the number of approaches developed to produce different recombinant peptides and proteins [1,2], the application of such a heterologous host is still limited or not even possible for a broad range of peptides and proteins. The examples of difficult-to-obtain proteins include eukaryotic ones, whose synthesis requires codon optimization or post-translational modification, disulfide-bonded, toxic and integral membrane peptides and proteins. Moreover, screening for optimal strategy for the desired protein synthesis can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. \n\nSince it has been identified that protein synthesis is a ribosome-mediated process [3] that does not require the integrity of the cell [4], cell-free (CF) or in vitro protein synthesis is considered a good alternative for recombinant protein production. The productivity of cell-free expression systems has been greatly improved and in vitro methodology has been used for a variety of applications. The CF protein synthesis systems are generally constructed with cell extract prepared from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, or rabbit reticulocytes. The E. coli extract-based CF expression system is the most popular, and broad varieties of in vitro protein synthesis systems are commercialized by various companies (e.g., Biotechrabbit, Invitrogen, Qiagen, Promega), and have been used for a range of applications. \n\nThe CF protein synthesis system has several advantages over current in vivo processes. Firstly, since there is no need to support cellular metabolism; all of the cellular resources can be efficiently directed toward the production of a single protein [5].",

However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

The success accomplished with high level expression of recombinant human insulin validated the significance of E. coli expression system for large-scale production of recombinant proteins. Besides human insulin, several recombinant proteins for therapeutic applications, including human growth hormone, interferon \u03b12a and \u03b12b, glucagon, urate oxidase, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and parathyroid hormone, have been successfully manufactured using E. coli expression system [12]. Although E. coli has been used extensively for expression of heterologous proteins, it is still not possible to determine the optimum production conditions for all the proteins. Expression conditions that are optimal for one protein may not be ideal for another protein. One of the major issues while producing heterologous proteins in E. coli is differences in codon usage between the two organisms. This difference in codon usage could cause errors in translation leading to low expression levels of recombinant proteins [13]. The other parameters that can affect the protein expression are choice of promoters, growth conditions and hydrophobicity of proteins.",

Besides human insulin, several recombinant proteins for therapeutic applications, including human growth hormone, interferon \u03b12a and \u03b12b, glucagon, urate oxidase, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and parathyroid hormone, have been successfully manufactured using E. coli expression system [12]. Although E. coli has been used extensively for expression of heterologous proteins, it is still not possible to determine the optimum production conditions for all the proteins. Expression conditions that are optimal for one protein may not be ideal for another protein. One of the major issues while producing heterologous proteins in E. coli is differences in codon usage between the two organisms. This difference in codon usage could cause errors in translation leading to low expression levels of recombinant proteins [13]. The other parameters that can affect the protein expression are choice of promoters, growth conditions and hydrophobicity of proteins.\n\n## Future perspectives\nE. coli is a preferred expression system for production of heterologous proteins due to its well-characterized genetics, ease of genetic manipulation, availability of several plasmid vectors and engineered host strains, low manufacturing cost, high yield of recombinant proteins as compared to other expression systems including yeast, mammalian cell lines, transgenic plants and transgenic animals. However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

Moreover, among the 239 US-FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved therapeutic peptides and proteins, as well as their 380 drug variants, the majority are manufactured by recombinant protein production [1]. \n\nIn both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media [2], which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium [2]. Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics [4,5]. \n\nA commonly encountered problem for recombinant protein production is impeded cell growth or reduced biomass accumulation. There are two major reasons for this phenomenon. The first is the general metabolic burden, which could be explained as the competition between biomass accumulation and recombinant protein production for metabolic materials such as cellular energy, ATP, and substrates, amino acids, [6]. This competition leads to stress responses including the stringent response and RNA polymerase subunit S-mediated stress responses, which could further decrease or even inhibit cell growth [7].",

McGuire, Abigail L Chang, Qinglei Gan, Chenguang Fan\n## Abstract\nRecombinant protein production plays an essential role in both biological studies and pharmaceutical production. Escherichia coli is one of the most favorable hosts for this purpose. Although a number of strategies for optimizing protein production have been developed, the effect of gene overexpression on host cell growth has been much less studied. Here, we performed high-throughput tests on the E. coli a complete set of E. coli K-12 ORF archive (ASKA) collection to quantify the effects of overexpressing individual E. coli genes on its growth. The results indicated that overexpressing membrane-associated proteins or proteins with high abundances of branched-chain amino acids tended to impair cell growth, the latter of which could be remedied by amino acid supplementation. Through this study, we expect to provide an index for a fast pre-study estimate of host cell growth in order to choose proper rescuing approaches when working with different proteins.\n## Introduction\nAfter the whole-genome sequences of thousands of organisms have been well documented, overexpressing genes to get highly pure proteins for further characterization and engineering becomes an indispensable part of biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and synthetic biology. Moreover, among the 239 US-FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved therapeutic peptides and proteins, as well as their 380 drug variants, the majority are manufactured by recombinant protein production [1]. \n\nIn both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media [2], which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium [2]. Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics [4,5]. \n\nA commonly encountered problem for recombinant protein production is impeded cell growth or reduced biomass accumulation. There are two major reasons for this phenomenon. The first is the general metabolic burden, which could be explained as the competition between biomass accumulation and recombinant protein production for metabolic materials such as cellular energy, ATP, and substrates, amino acids, [6]. This competition leads to stress responses including the stringent response and RNA polymerase subunit S-mediated stress responses, which could further decrease or even inhibit cell growth [7].",

RMPs usually consisting of linear, immunodominant, and phylogenetically conserved epitopes, has been applied in the experimental diagnosis of various human and animal diseases, such as leishmaniasis, brucellosis, cysticercosis, Chagas disease, hepatitis, leptospirosis, leprosy, filariasis, schistosomiasis, dengue, and COVID-19. The synthetic genes for these epitopes are joined to code a single RMP, either with spacers or fused, with different biochemical properties. The epitopes\u2019 high density within the RMPs contributes to a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The RMPs can also sidestep the need for multiple peptide synthesis or multiple recombinant proteins, reducing costs and enhancing the standardization conditions for immunoassays. Methods such as bioinformatics and circular dichroism have been widely applied in the development of new RMPs, helping to guide their construction and better understand their structure. Several RMPs have been expressed, mainly using the Escherichia coli expression system, highlighting the importance of these cells in the biotechnological field. In fact, technological advances in this area, offering a wide range of different strains to be used, make these cells the most widely used expression platform. RMPs have been experimentally used to diagnose a broad range of illnesses in the laboratory, suggesting they could also be useful for accurate diagnoses commercially. On this point, the RMP method offers a tempting substitute for the production of promising antigens used to assemble commercial diagnostic kits.",

(1989) [132].\n\nThe first E. coli isolate was deposited in the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC, UK) in 1920.Later on, Cohen et al. (1973) made a groundbreaking discovery of recombinant DNA technology, which marked a pivotal moment in the biotechnology field five decades ago [133].",

Galdino\n## Abstract\nRecombinant multiepitope proteins (RMPs) are a promising alternative for application in diagnostic tests and, given their wide application in the most diverse diseases, this review article aims to survey the use of these antigens for diagnosis, as well as discuss the main points surrounding these antigens. RMPs usually consisting of linear, immunodominant, and phylogenetically conserved epitopes, has been applied in the experimental diagnosis of various human and animal diseases, such as leishmaniasis, brucellosis, cysticercosis, Chagas disease, hepatitis, leptospirosis, leprosy, filariasis, schistosomiasis, dengue, and COVID-19. The synthetic genes for these epitopes are joined to code a single RMP, either with spacers or fused, with different biochemical properties. The epitopes\u2019 high density within the RMPs contributes to a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The RMPs can also sidestep the need for multiple peptide synthesis or multiple recombinant proteins, reducing costs and enhancing the standardization conditions for immunoassays. Methods such as bioinformatics and circular dichroism have been widely applied in the development of new RMPs, helping to guide their construction and better understand their structure. Several RMPs have been expressed, mainly using the Escherichia coli expression system, highlighting the importance of these cells in the biotechnological field. In fact, technological advances in this area, offering a wide range of different strains to be used, make these cells the most widely used expression platform. RMPs have been experimentally used to diagnose a broad range of illnesses in the laboratory, suggesting they could also be useful for accurate diagnoses commercially. On this point, the RMP method offers a tempting substitute for the production of promising antigens used to assemble commercial diagnostic kits.\n## Escherichia coli: the platform of choice for RMP production\nAlthough various host cells described in the literature can serve as expression systems for recombinant protein production, almost all diagnostic RMP studies to date have used E. coli as the expression system of choice  (Tables 1-5).What makes this host so well-suited for this purpose?This expression system boasts a long history and offers several well-established advantages, including ease of manipulation, low-cost culture, and rapid growth kinetics.The doubling time of 20 min facilitates the achievement of high cell density cultures, with a theoretical concentration limit of ~ 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/mL [26,130].Furthermore, E. coli stands out as the most cost-effective host, allowing for the attainment of high cellular densities with inexpensive culture media.Additionally, well-developed tools for molecular manipulations, coupled with in-depth knowledge of its biology [131], contribute to the versatility of bacterium as a protein expression host.The E. coli cultivation process involves growing the bacteria in a culture medium, with selection antibiotics, until reaching an optical density 600 (OD) 600 between 0.6 and 0.8, a mid-log phase indicative.For that, the most widely used media are Luria-Bertani, Terrific Broth, and Super Broth, based on mixtures of tryptone/ peptone and yeast extract in a saline solution, which can either be sodium chloride or sodium phosphate.To optimize growth, the bacterial culture must be kept at a temperature and rotation of 37 \u00b0C and 150-200 revolutions per minute (rpm).Upon reaching the desired absorbance, the inducer molecule must be added to the culture medium, typically the allolactose analog isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranose (IPTG), to start recombinant gene transcription.More details of this approach are well provided by Sambrook et al. (1989) [132].\n\nThe first E. coli isolate was deposited in the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC, UK) in 1920.Later on, Cohen et al. (1973) made a groundbreaking discovery of recombinant DNA technology, which marked a pivotal moment in the biotechnology field five decades ago [133].",

However, challenging proteins are often produced with low titres or as inclusion bodies, and the manufacturing process needs to be developed individually for each protein. Recently, we developed the CASPON^TM technology, a generic fusion tag-based platform process for high-titer soluble expression including a standardized downstream processing and highly specific enzymatic cleavage of the fusion tag. To assess potential strategies for further improvement of the N-terminally fused CASPON^TM tag, we modified the 5\u2019UTR and 5\u2019 region of the tag-coding mRNA to optimize the ribosome-mRNA interactions. Results In the present work, we found that by modifying the 5\u2019UTR sequence of a pET30a cer plasmid-based system, expression of the fusion protein CASPON^TM-tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 was altered in laboratory-scale carbon-limited fed-batch cultivations, but no significant increase in expression titre was achieved. Translation efficiency was highest for a construct carrying an expression enhancer element and additionally possessing a very favourable interaction energy between ribosome and mRNA (\u2206G_total). However, a construct with comparatively low transcriptional efficiency, which lacked the expression enhancer sequence and carried the most favourable \u2206G_total tested, led to the highest recombinant protein formation alongside the reference pET30a construct. Furthermore, we found, that by introducing synonymous mutations within the nucleotide sequence of the T7AC element of the CASPON^TM tag, utilizing a combination of rare and non-rare codons, the free folding energy of the nucleotides at the 5\u2019 end (-4 to +\u200937) of the transcript encoding the CASPON^TM tag increased by 6\u00a0kcal/mol. Surprisingly, this new T7AC _ rare variant led to improved recombinant protein titres by 1.3-fold up to 5.3-fold, shown with three industry-relevant proteins in lab-scale carbon limited fed-batch fermentations under industrially relevant conditions. Conclusions This study reveals some of the complex interdependencies between the ribosome and mRNA that govern recombinant protein expression. By modifying the 5\u2019UTR to obtain an optimized interaction energy between the mRNA and the ribosome (\u0394G_total), transcript levels were changed, highlighting the different translation efficiencies of individual transcripts. It was shown that the highest recombinant titre was not obtained by the construct with the most efficient translation but by a construct with a generally high transcript amount coupled with a favourable \u0394G_total. Furthermore, an unexpectedly high potential to enhance expression by introducing silent mutations including multiple rare codons into the 5\u2019end of the CAPON^TM tag\u2019s mRNA was identified. Although the titres of the fusion proteins were dramatically increased, no formation of inclusion bodies or negative impact on cell growth was observed. We hypothesize that the drastic increase in titre is most likely caused by better ribosomal binding site accessibility. Our study, which demonstrates the influence of changes in ribosome-mRNA interactions on protein expression under industrially relevant production conditions, opens the door to the applicability of the new T7AC _ rare tag in biopharmaceutical industry using the CASPON^TM platform process.",

Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role. These include the basic choice of the expression system design, like plasmid-based or genome-integrated expression cassettes, and, in this regard, the copy number of the plasmid and the gene of interest (GOI) [2,6]. Also, a suitable promotor system for high level protein expression must be employed and the mRNA has to have an appropriate stability for recombinant protein expression [6]. Furthermore, the choice of fermentation process and parameters, the media composition and induction strategy play a major role for high-yield recombinant protein production [6]. \n\nAlongside all these factors, the optimization of translation initiation, which is the rate limiting and most tightly regulated step in protein biosynthesis, has received much attention in the last two decades [10].",

Translation efficiency was highest for a construct carrying an expression enhancer element and additionally possessing a very favourable interaction energy between ribosome and mRNA (\u2206G_total). However, a construct with comparatively low transcriptional efficiency, which lacked the expression enhancer sequence and carried the most favourable \u2206G_total tested, led to the highest recombinant protein formation alongside the reference pET30a construct. Furthermore, we found, that by introducing synonymous mutations within the nucleotide sequence of the T7AC element of the CASPON^TM tag, utilizing a combination of rare and non-rare codons, the free folding energy of the nucleotides at the 5\u2019 end (-4 to +\u200937) of the transcript encoding the CASPON^TM tag increased by 6\u00a0kcal/mol. Surprisingly, this new T7AC _ rare variant led to improved recombinant protein titres by 1.3-fold up to 5.3-fold, shown with three industry-relevant proteins in lab-scale carbon limited fed-batch fermentations under industrially relevant conditions. Conclusions This study reveals some of the complex interdependencies between the ribosome and mRNA that govern recombinant protein expression. By modifying the 5\u2019UTR to obtain an optimized interaction energy between the mRNA and the ribosome (\u0394G_total), transcript levels were changed, highlighting the different translation efficiencies of individual transcripts. It was shown that the highest recombinant titre was not obtained by the construct with the most efficient translation but by a construct with a generally high transcript amount coupled with a favourable \u0394G_total. Furthermore, an unexpectedly high potential to enhance expression by introducing silent mutations including multiple rare codons into the 5\u2019end of the CAPON^TM tag\u2019s mRNA was identified. Although the titres of the fusion proteins were dramatically increased, no formation of inclusion bodies or negative impact on cell growth was observed. We hypothesize that the drastic increase in titre is most likely caused by better ribosomal binding site accessibility. Our study, which demonstrates the influence of changes in ribosome-mRNA interactions on protein expression under industrially relevant production conditions, opens the door to the applicability of the new T7AC _ rare tag in biopharmaceutical industry using the CASPON^TM platform process.\n## Background\nEscherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role. These include the basic choice of the expression system design, like plasmid-based or genome-integrated expression cassettes, and, in this regard, the copy number of the plasmid and the gene of interest (GOI) [2,6]. Also, a suitable promotor system for high level protein expression must be employed and the mRNA has to have an appropriate stability for recombinant protein expression [6]. Furthermore, the choice of fermentation process and parameters, the media composition and induction strategy play a major role for high-yield recombinant protein production [6]. \n\nAlongside all these factors, the optimization of translation initiation, which is the rate limiting and most tightly regulated step in protein biosynthesis, has received much attention in the last two decades [10].",

The Escherichia coli is still the dominant host for recombinant protein production but, as a bacterial cell, it also has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of the E. coli expression system. Conversely, E. coli benefits of cost, ease of use and scale make it essential to design new approaches directed for improved recombinant protein production in this host cell. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering novel tailored-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements. Gene fusion technology has been widely used for the improvement of soluble protein production and/or purification in E. coli, and for increasing peptide\u2019s immunogenicity as well. New fusion partners are constantly emerging and complementing the traditional solutions, as for instance, the Fh8 fusion tag that has been recently studied and ranked among the best solubility enhancer partners. In this review, we provide an overview of current strategies to improve recombinant protein production in E. coli, including the key factors for successful protein production, highlighting soluble protein production, and a comprehensive summary of the latest available and traditionally used gene fusion technologies. A special emphasis is given to the recently discovered Fh8 fusion system that can be used for soluble protein production, purification, and immunogenicity in E. coli. The number of existing fusion tags will probably increase in the next few years, and efforts should be taken to better understand how fusion tags act in E. coli. This knowledge will undoubtedly drive the development of new tailored-made tools for protein production in this bacterial system.",

They play important roles in a variety of cell processes, including cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle, and their failure is consequently correlated with several diseases.\n\nWith the introduction of the DNA recombinant technology in the 1970s, proteins started to be expressed in several host organisms resulting in a faster and easier process compared to their natural sources (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). Escherichia coli remains the dominant host for producing recombinant proteins, owing to its advantageous fast and inexpensive, and high yield protein production, together with the well-characterized genetics and variety of available molecular tools (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009).\n\nThe recombinant protein production in E. coli has greatly contributed for several structural studies; for instance, about 90% of the structures available in the Protein Data Bank were determined on proteins produced in E. coli. (Nettleship et al., 2010;Bird, 2011). The E. coli recombinant production has also boosted the biopharmaceutical industry: 30% of the recombinant biopharmaceuticals licensed up to 2011 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) were obtained using this host cell (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Walsh, 2010;Berlec and Strukelj, 2013).\n\nEscherichia coli recombinant protein-based products can also be found in major sectors of the enzyme industry and the agricultural industry with applications ranging from catalysis (e.g., washing detergents) and therapeutic use (e.g., vaccine development) to functional analysis and structure determination (e.g., crystallography; Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). As a bacterial system, the E. coli has, however, limitations at expressing more complex proteins due to the lack of sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications, resulting in poor solubility of the protein of interest that are produced as inclusion bodies (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Kamionka, 2011).

Xylanolytic enzymes have a great number of possible applications in many biotechnological processes and therefore, these enzymes are continuously attracting the attention of scientists. Due to this fact, different \u03b2-Xylosidases have been isolated, purified and characterized from several bacteria and fungi. Microorganisms in this respect have gained much momentum for production of these significant biocatalysts with remarkable features. It is difficult to propagate microorganisms for efficient and cost-competitive production of \u03b2-Xylosidase from hemicelluloses due to expensive conditions of fermentation. The screening of new organisms with an enhanced production of \u03b2-Xylosidases has been made possible with the help of recombinant DNA technology. \u03b2-Xylosidase genes haven been cloned and expressed on large scale in both homologous and heterologous hosts with the advent of genetic engineering. Therefore, we have reviewed the literature regarding cloning of \u03b2-Xylosidase genes into various hosts for their heterologous production along with sequence similarities among different \u03b2-Xylosidases. The study provides insight into the current status of cloning, expression and sequence analysis of \u03b2-Xylosidases for industrial applications.",

                    "text": "Escherichia coli has been extensively used as a host microorganism for the production of recombinant proteins because of many expression advantages including simplified downstream processing, increased biological activity, enhanced product stability and solubility and authenticity of N-terminus of expressed proteins (Mergulhao et al. 2005). Considerable attention has been given to extracellular production of recombinant enzymes in E. coli as it has substantial advantages over periplasmic or cytoplasmic productions (Sommer et al. 2010). For heterologous gene expression in E. coli a number of different expression vectors and host strains are used. Liang et al. (2009) cloned Bxyl gene from Bacillus halodurans C-125 with its own promoter and transcription terminator into pQE80L expression vector and transformed into E. coli JM109. Using p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-Xylose (pNPX) as a substrate the crude enzyme was analyzed for its xylosidase activity which was estimated to be 11 U from 450 mL cultivated cells of E. coli. The open reading frame of another \u03b2-Xylosidase gene (xysB) along with its promoter region was isolated from Aeromonas caviae ME-1 and cloned into pT7-Blue vector to express in E. coli DH5\u03b1 (Suzuki et al. 2001). The specific activity of the enzyme XysB was finally enhanced to 56 nKat/mg protein. \n\nFor the expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli the pET expression vector systems are categorized among the most effective ones. Tsujibo et al. (2001) used an expression vector pET-20b(+) to overexpress a \u03b2-Xylosidase gene (bxlA) with no typical \u221210 and \u221235 promoter boxes from Streptomyces thermoviolaceus in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysE. The enzyme BxlA was produced in the cytoplasm induced by IPTG and from a 1.2 L culture of E. coli 50 mg of purified enzyme was obtained.",

Mustafa, Sumaira Kousar, M. Rajoka, A. Jamil\n## Abstract\nCommercial scale degradation of hemicelluloses into easily accessible sugar residues is practically crucial in industrial as well as biochemical processes. Xylanolytic enzymes have a great number of possible applications in many biotechnological processes and therefore, these enzymes are continuously attracting the attention of scientists. Due to this fact, different \u03b2-Xylosidases have been isolated, purified and characterized from several bacteria and fungi. Microorganisms in this respect have gained much momentum for production of these significant biocatalysts with remarkable features. It is difficult to propagate microorganisms for efficient and cost-competitive production of \u03b2-Xylosidase from hemicelluloses due to expensive conditions of fermentation. The screening of new organisms with an enhanced production of \u03b2-Xylosidases has been made possible with the help of recombinant DNA technology. \u03b2-Xylosidase genes haven been cloned and expressed on large scale in both homologous and heterologous hosts with the advent of genetic engineering. Therefore, we have reviewed the literature regarding cloning of \u03b2-Xylosidase genes into various hosts for their heterologous production along with sequence similarities among different \u03b2-Xylosidases. The study provides insight into the current status of cloning, expression and sequence analysis of \u03b2-Xylosidases for industrial applications.\n## Expression in Escherichia coli\nEscherichia coli has been extensively used as a host microorganism for the production of recombinant proteins because of many expression advantages including simplified downstream processing, increased biological activity, enhanced product stability and solubility and authenticity of N-terminus of expressed proteins (Mergulhao et al. 2005). Considerable attention has been given to extracellular production of recombinant enzymes in E. coli as it has substantial advantages over periplasmic or cytoplasmic productions (Sommer et al. 2010). For heterologous gene expression in E. coli a number of different expression vectors and host strains are used. Liang et al. (2009) cloned Bxyl gene from Bacillus halodurans C-125 with its own promoter and transcription terminator into pQE80L expression vector and transformed into E. coli JM109. Using p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-Xylose (pNPX) as a substrate the crude enzyme was analyzed for its xylosidase activity which was estimated to be 11 U from 450 mL cultivated cells of E. coli. The open reading frame of another \u03b2-Xylosidase gene (xysB) along with its promoter region was isolated from Aeromonas caviae ME-1 and cloned into pT7-Blue vector to express in E. coli DH5\u03b1 (Suzuki et al. 2001). The specific activity of the enzyme XysB was finally enhanced to 56 nKat/mg protein. \n\nFor the expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli the pET expression vector systems are categorized among the most effective ones. Tsujibo et al. (2001) used an expression vector pET-20b(+) to overexpress a \u03b2-Xylosidase gene (bxlA) with no typical \u221210 and \u221235 promoter boxes from Streptomyces thermoviolaceus in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysE. The enzyme BxlA was produced in the cytoplasm induced by IPTG and from a 1.2 L culture of E. coli 50 mg of purified enzyme was obtained.",

With the use of high-throughput screening technologies for soluble protein production, uncountable target proteins have been produced in a soluble and homogeneous state enabling the realization of further studies. Evaluation of hundreds conditions requires the use of high-throughput cloning and screening methods. Here we describe a new versatile vector suite dedicated to the expression improvement of recombinant proteins (RP) with solubility problems. This vector suite allows the parallel cloning of the same PCR product into the 12 different expression vectors evaluating protein expression under different promoter strength, different fusion tags as well as different solubility enhancer proteins. Additionally, we propose the use of a new fusion protein which appears to be a useful solubility enhancer. Above all we propose in this work an economic and useful vector suite to fast track the solubility of different RP. We also propose a new solubility enhancer protein that can be included in the evaluation of the expression of RP that are insoluble in classical expression conditions.",

Several hosts are available for protein production among them, Escherichia coli has been by far the most widely used. Some advantages of this host is the low cost, infrastructure of implementation, easy handling, high yield production, and an ever increasing set of tools and genetic information useful for the expression of challenging targets. Despite its importance and utility, recombinant proteins (RP) not always are produced in a soluble and homogeneous state. For these \"difficult to express\" proteins, several approaches have been developed in order to overcome the problems associated with insolubility. Some parameters that can affect protein expression are: induction temperature, promoter strength, use of specific E. coli strains, co-expression of molecular chaperones or biological partners and the use of different solubility enhancer or fusion proteins (Correa and Oppezzo, 2011). In the last decade, the advent of high-throughput screening methods have facilitated the evaluation of hundreds of conditions generated from the combination of the mentioned parameters in order to find one that gives a soluble protein (Vincentelli et al., 2011;Vincentelli and Romier, 2013). However, to exploit all these variables it is necessary to have a method for cloning the target gene in many different vectors in a fast and simple manner. Several techniques were recently generated to facilitate the cloning of target genes in a parallel way, in which the same insert can be introduced into different expression vectors simultaneously. Among these methods are the Gateway technology [Invitrogen, (Esposito et al., 2009)], In-Fusion technology, [Clontech, (Berrow et al., 2007)], Ligase Independent Cloning, (Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990), and Restriction Free Cloning, [RF cloning, (Unger et al., 2010)].",

Ortega, G. Obal, P. Alzari, R. Vincentelli, P. Oppezzo\n## Abstract\nRecombinant protein expression has become an invaluable tool for academic and biotechnological projects. With the use of high-throughput screening technologies for soluble protein production, uncountable target proteins have been produced in a soluble and homogeneous state enabling the realization of further studies. Evaluation of hundreds conditions requires the use of high-throughput cloning and screening methods. Here we describe a new versatile vector suite dedicated to the expression improvement of recombinant proteins (RP) with solubility problems. This vector suite allows the parallel cloning of the same PCR product into the 12 different expression vectors evaluating protein expression under different promoter strength, different fusion tags as well as different solubility enhancer proteins. Additionally, we propose the use of a new fusion protein which appears to be a useful solubility enhancer. Above all we propose in this work an economic and useful vector suite to fast track the solubility of different RP. We also propose a new solubility enhancer protein that can be included in the evaluation of the expression of RP that are insoluble in classical expression conditions.\n## INTRODUCTION\nRecombinant protein production has become a routine practice in many laboratories from academic to industrial fields. Several hosts are available for protein production among them, Escherichia coli has been by far the most widely used. Some advantages of this host is the low cost, infrastructure of implementation, easy handling, high yield production, and an ever increasing set of tools and genetic information useful for the expression of challenging targets. Despite its importance and utility, recombinant proteins (RP) not always are produced in a soluble and homogeneous state. For these \"difficult to express\" proteins, several approaches have been developed in order to overcome the problems associated with insolubility. Some parameters that can affect protein expression are: induction temperature, promoter strength, use of specific E. coli strains, co-expression of molecular chaperones or biological partners and the use of different solubility enhancer or fusion proteins (Correa and Oppezzo, 2011). In the last decade, the advent of high-throughput screening methods have facilitated the evaluation of hundreds of conditions generated from the combination of the mentioned parameters in order to find one that gives a soluble protein (Vincentelli et al., 2011;Vincentelli and Romier, 2013). However, to exploit all these variables it is necessary to have a method for cloning the target gene in many different vectors in a fast and simple manner. Several techniques were recently generated to facilitate the cloning of target genes in a parallel way, in which the same insert can be introduced into different expression vectors simultaneously. Among these methods are the Gateway technology [Invitrogen, (Esposito et al., 2009)], In-Fusion technology, [Clontech, (Berrow et al., 2007)], Ligase Independent Cloning, (Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990), and Restriction Free Cloning, [RF cloning, (Unger et al., 2010)].",

Due to the wide range of effects in humans, any disruption in hGH secretion could have serious consequences. This highlights the clinical importance of hGH production in the treatment of different diseases associated with a deficiency of this hormone. The production of recombinant mature hormone in suitable hosts and secretion of this therapeutic protein into the extracellular space can be considered as one of the best cost-effective approaches not only to obtain the active form of the protein but also endotoxin-free preparation. Since the natural growth hormone signal peptide is of eukaryotic origin and is not detectable by any of the Escherichia coli secretory systems, including Sec and Tat, and is therefore unable to secrete hGH in the prokaryotic systems, designing a new and efficient signal peptide is essential to direct hGh to the extracellular space. Results In this study, using a combination of the bioinformatics design and molecular genetics, the protein A signal peptide from Staphylococcus aureus was modified, redesigned and then fused to the mature hGH coding region. The recombinant hGH was then expressed in E. coli and successfully secreted to the medium through the Sec pathway. Secretion of the hGH into the medium was verified using SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. Recombinant hGH was then expressed in E. coli and successfully secreted into cell culture medium via the Sec pathway. The secretion of hGH into the extracellular medium was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the addition of glycine was shown to improve hGH secretion onto the culture medium. Equations for determining the optimal conditions were also determined. Functional hGH analysis using an ELISA-based method confirmed that the ratio of the active form of secreted hGH to the inactive form in the periplasm is higher than this ratio in the cytoplasm. Conclusions Since the native signal protein peptide of S. aureus protein A was not able to deliver hGH to the extracellular space, it was modified using bioinformatics tools and fused to the n-terminal region of hGh to show that the redesigned signal peptide was functional.",

The advantages of this system include fast growth, high cell density using simple and low cost growth medium, known genetic information, availability of a large number of expression vectors and availability of mutant host strains, simple transfer, easy control, possibility of mass production of recombinant proteins and thus cost-effectiveness. In the case of yeast and mammalian hosts, in most cases, protein production is much lower and more expensive than E. coli host is.",

The expression of a foreign protein in E. coli is influenced by a range of factors, and there is no standard strategy to overcome these issues. \n\nOverall, five variabilities affect the solubility and expression of proteins in the cloning process, which might help to proper folding of desired protein and increase the expression level: 1-using proper host, 2-proper vector, 3-co-expression with other genes, 4-changing the gene sequences, and 5-variations of culture parameters of the recombinant host strains [9]. Using an appropriate expression host and vector significantly increase the activity and solubility of target proteins. A suitable vector can enhance expression, folding, and solubility in different ways. The folding can be improved in hosts that allow the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm when using vectors designed for cytoplasmic expression [10][11][12][13]. The pET-21b(+) vector has a T7 RNA promoter and 6 His-tag DNA sequence, which facilitates the purification and detection of protein or may increase the probability of biological activities by affecting solubility in the cytoplasm or exportation to the periplasmic area.",

The expression of a foreign protein in E. coli is influenced by a range of factors, and there is no standard strategy to overcome these issues. \n\nOverall, five variabilities affect the solubility and expression of proteins in the cloning process, which might help to proper folding of desired protein and increase the expression level: 1-using proper host, 2-proper vector, 3-co-expression with other genes, 4-changing the gene sequences, and 5-variations of culture parameters of the recombinant host strains [9]. Using an appropriate expression host and vector significantly increase the activity and solubility of target proteins. A suitable vector can enhance expression, folding, and solubility in different ways. The folding can be improved in hosts that allow the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm when using vectors designed for cytoplasmic expression [10][11][12][13]. The pET-21b(+) vector has a T7 RNA promoter and 6 His-tag DNA sequence, which facilitates the purification and detection of protein or may increase the probability of biological activities by affecting solubility in the cytoplasm or exportation to the periplasmic area.",

Researchers now select from among mammalian, insect, yeast, and prokaryotic hosts, and the number of vectors available for use in these organisms continues to grow. With the increased availability of cDNAs and protein coding sequencing information, it is certain that these and other, yet to be developed systems will be important in the future. Despite the development of eukaryotic systems, E. coli remains the most widely used host for recombinant protein expression. Optimization of recombinant protein expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host systems has been carried out by varying simple parameters such as expression vectors, host strains, media composition, and growth temperature. Recombinant gene expression in eukaryotic systems is often the only viable route to the large-scale production of authentic, post translationally modified proteins. It is becoming increasingly easy to find a suitable system to overexpress virtually any gene product, provided that it is properly engineered into an appropriate expression vector.",

E. coli is comprehensively used in laboratories which resulted in technologies to target protein over expression to different intracellular compartments (Fig. 1).This is beneficial because these compartments have various environments which might enable folding of particular proteins of interest [2]. The optimization of recombinant protein expression in E.coli was carried out widely by trial and error by altering the simple parameters like expression vectors, host strains, media composition, and growth temperature [3]. During the past years, pervasive studies have shown that replacing codons with a heterologous gene with synonymous ones used superiorly on the expression of host (codon optimization), and manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the translational initiation region could have a profound effect on recombinant protein yields [4]. In order to perform molecular epigenetic techniques successfully, it is important to have a full understanding of the properties and of the various Escherichia coli host strains that are commonly used for the propagation and manipulation of recombinant DNA [5]. E.coli is an enteric rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium with a circular genome of 4.6Mb [6]. It was initially chosen as a model system because of its ability to grow on chemically defined media and its rapid growth rate. In rich media, during the log phase of its growth, E.coli doubles every 20-30min; hence, with overnight incubation period, single selected organisms will double enough times to yield a colony on an agar plate 0r 1-2 billion cells per millilitre of the liquid media. The ease of its transformability and genetic manipulation has subsequently solidified the role of E.coli as the host of choice for the propagation, manipulation, and characterization of recombinant DNA [7]. In the past 60 years, intensive research was performed on E.coli, as a result, now a lot more is known about these bacilli than any other organisms on earth. A diverse variety of E.coli mutants were isolated and characterized.",

Researchers now select from among mammalian, insect, yeast, and prokaryotic hosts, and the number of vectors available for use in these organisms continues to grow. With the increased availability of cDNAs and protein coding sequencing information, it is certain that these and other, yet to be developed systems will be important in the future. Despite the development of eukaryotic systems, E. coli remains the most widely used host for recombinant protein expression. Optimization of recombinant protein expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host systems has been carried out by varying simple parameters such as expression vectors, host strains, media composition, and growth temperature. Recombinant gene expression in eukaryotic systems is often the only viable route to the large-scale production of authentic, post translationally modified proteins. It is becoming increasingly easy to find a suitable system to overexpress virtually any gene product, provided that it is properly engineered into an appropriate expression vector.\n## Escherichia coli\nE.coli has rapid growth rate, ease of high cell density fermentation, affordability and the availability of excellent genetic tools, due to these characteristics of E.coli it have been extensively used for protein over expression [1]. E. coli is comprehensively used in laboratories which resulted in technologies to target protein over expression to different intracellular compartments (Fig. 1).This is beneficial because these compartments have various environments which might enable folding of particular proteins of interest [2]. The optimization of recombinant protein expression in E.coli was carried out widely by trial and error by altering the simple parameters like expression vectors, host strains, media composition, and growth temperature [3]. During the past years, pervasive studies have shown that replacing codons with a heterologous gene with synonymous ones used superiorly on the expression of host (codon optimization), and manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the translational initiation region could have a profound effect on recombinant protein yields [4]. In order to perform molecular epigenetic techniques successfully, it is important to have a full understanding of the properties and of the various Escherichia coli host strains that are commonly used for the propagation and manipulation of recombinant DNA [5]. E.coli is an enteric rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium with a circular genome of 4.6Mb [6]. It was initially chosen as a model system because of its ability to grow on chemically defined media and its rapid growth rate. In rich media, during the log phase of its growth, E.coli doubles every 20-30min; hence, with overnight incubation period, single selected organisms will double enough times to yield a colony on an agar plate 0r 1-2 billion cells per millilitre of the liquid media. The ease of its transformability and genetic manipulation has subsequently solidified the role of E.coli as the host of choice for the propagation, manipulation, and characterization of recombinant DNA [7]. In the past 60 years, intensive research was performed on E.coli, as a result, now a lot more is known about these bacilli than any other organisms on earth. A diverse variety of E.coli mutants were isolated and characterized.",

This is due to the difficulty and expenses to apply a controlled continuous glucose feed to shaken cultures. New ready-made growth media, e.g. by biocatalytic release of glucose from a polymer, offer a simple solution for the application of the fed-batch principle in shaken plate and flask cultures. Their wider use has shown that the controlled diet not only provides a solution to obtain significantly higher cell yields, but also in many cases folding of the target protein is improved by the applied lower growth rates; i.e. final volumetric yields for the active protein can be a multiple of what is obtained in complex medium cultures. The combination of the conventional optimization approaches with new and easy applicable growth systems has revolutionized recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli in view of product yield, culture robustness as well as significantly increased cell densities. This technical development establishes the basis for successful miniaturization and parallelization which is now an important tool for synthetic biology and protein engineering approaches. This review provides an overview of the recent developments, results and applications of advanced growth systems which use a controlled glucose release as substrate supply.",

                    "text": "For many reasons Escherichia coli is still the preferred choice as a host system for protein production. With relatively low costs one can achieve high biomass and high protein yield in only short cultivation times. Furthermore, E. coli is extremely well-studied in its biochemical and physiological characteristics. With a wealth of tools available E. coli also can be easily adapted as needed by genetic manipulation. However, even though the general procedure for protein production is straightforward, protein aggregation during expression is still a major obstacle. Different approaches are commonly applied to address this problem, and to optimize protein folding while maximizing protein expression. The currently available expression systems with their advantages and pitfalls have been regularly reviewed [1][2][3][4]. A smart combination of the different parts of the system (e.g. prokaryotic or eukaryotic host organism, type of plasmid with its specific features) can lead to an improved expression. Additional conventional approaches for protein expression optimization are the coexpression of chaperons, use of codon optimized genes, alternate protein tags, change of cultivation medium, production process optimization [2,5]. The choice of the system influences the success of proper protein folding and hence the production of active, soluble protein. Even more specialized systems facing folding problems have been developed. The preexpression of Erv1p sulfhydryl oxidase and disulfide bond isomerases for example is a robust technique for the production of disulfide bonds containing proteins [6,7]. \n\nSince every protein is different, the expression and purification strategies must be defined for each single case. In their review, Gr\u00e4slund et al. [2] summarized that there are many choices to make when expressing proteins regarding all the parts of the system; e.g. selection of E. coli strain, the fusion of the protein with a His-tag or another tag, the application of a T7 RNA polymerase expression system or another regulated promoter system, and finally the choice of the medium and cultivation conditions. They published a consensus protocol which they agreed to be a good starting-point when aiming to produce a recombinant protein. Nevertheless, success is protein dependent and a robust and ever-working strategy is still missing.",

Neubauer, P. Neubauer\n## Abstract\nWhile the nutrient limited fed-batch technology is the standard of the cultivation of microorganisms and production of heterologous proteins in industry, despite its advantages in view of metabolic control and high cell density growth, shaken batch cultures are still the standard for protein production and expression screening in molecular biology and biochemistry laboratories. This is due to the difficulty and expenses to apply a controlled continuous glucose feed to shaken cultures. New ready-made growth media, e.g. by biocatalytic release of glucose from a polymer, offer a simple solution for the application of the fed-batch principle in shaken plate and flask cultures. Their wider use has shown that the controlled diet not only provides a solution to obtain significantly higher cell yields, but also in many cases folding of the target protein is improved by the applied lower growth rates; i.e. final volumetric yields for the active protein can be a multiple of what is obtained in complex medium cultures. The combination of the conventional optimization approaches with new and easy applicable growth systems has revolutionized recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli in view of product yield, culture robustness as well as significantly increased cell densities. This technical development establishes the basis for successful miniaturization and parallelization which is now an important tool for synthetic biology and protein engineering approaches. This review provides an overview of the recent developments, results and applications of advanced growth systems which use a controlled glucose release as substrate supply.\n## Background\nFor many reasons Escherichia coli is still the preferred choice as a host system for protein production. With relatively low costs one can achieve high biomass and high protein yield in only short cultivation times. Furthermore, E. coli is extremely well-studied in its biochemical and physiological characteristics. With a wealth of tools available E. coli also can be easily adapted as needed by genetic manipulation. However, even though the general procedure for protein production is straightforward, protein aggregation during expression is still a major obstacle. Different approaches are commonly applied to address this problem, and to optimize protein folding while maximizing protein expression. The currently available expression systems with their advantages and pitfalls have been regularly reviewed [1][2][3][4]. A smart combination of the different parts of the system (e.g. prokaryotic or eukaryotic host organism, type of plasmid with its specific features) can lead to an improved expression. Additional conventional approaches for protein expression optimization are the coexpression of chaperons, use of codon optimized genes, alternate protein tags, change of cultivation medium, production process optimization [2,5]. The choice of the system influences the success of proper protein folding and hence the production of active, soluble protein. Even more specialized systems facing folding problems have been developed. The preexpression of Erv1p sulfhydryl oxidase and disulfide bond isomerases for example is a robust technique for the production of disulfide bonds containing proteins [6,7]. \n\nSince every protein is different, the expression and purification strategies must be defined for each single case. In their review, Gr\u00e4slund et al. [2] summarized that there are many choices to make when expressing proteins regarding all the parts of the system; e.g. selection of E. coli strain, the fusion of the protein with a His-tag or another tag, the application of a T7 RNA polymerase expression system or another regulated promoter system, and finally the choice of the medium and cultivation conditions. They published a consensus protocol which they agreed to be a good starting-point when aiming to produce a recombinant protein. Nevertheless, success is protein dependent and a robust and ever-working strategy is still missing.",

Thermophilic microorganisms are an excellent source of thermostable enzymes that can tolerate the extreme conditions of industrial processing. Thermostability of xylanases from thermophilic microorganisms has given the importance for a specific activity at elevated temperatures and distinction due to biochemical properties, structure, and mode of action. Optimized xylanases can be produced through genetic engineering: a novel xylanase is isolated from an extreme environment and then genetically modified to improve suitability for industrial contexts. Recombinant protein techniques have made it possible to engineer and express thermostable xylanases in bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi. We will discuss the biotechnological potential of xylanases from thermophilic microorganism and the ways they are being optimized and expressed for industrial applications.",

Basit, Wei Jiang, Kashif Rahim\n## Abstract\nLignocellulosic biomass is a renewable raw material. Industrial interest with new technology has grown to take advantage of this raw material. Different microbial enzymes are treated with biomass to produce the desired products under ideal industrial conditions. Xylanases are the key enzymes that degrade the xylosidic linkages in the xylan backbone of the biomass, and commercial enzymes are categorized into different glycoside hydrolase families. Thermophilic microorganisms are an excellent source of thermostable enzymes that can tolerate the extreme conditions of industrial processing. Thermostability of xylanases from thermophilic microorganisms has given the importance for a specific activity at elevated temperatures and distinction due to biochemical properties, structure, and mode of action. Optimized xylanases can be produced through genetic engineering: a novel xylanase is isolated from an extreme environment and then genetically modified to improve suitability for industrial contexts. Recombinant protein techniques have made it possible to engineer and express thermostable xylanases in bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi. We will discuss the biotechnological potential of xylanases from thermophilic microorganism and the ways they are being optimized and expressed for industrial applications.\n## Bacterial expression system\nEscherichia coli are the most promising host for cloning and expression of heterologous recombinant proteins.

            "abstract": "Bacteria can produce recombinant proteins quickly and cost effectively. However, their physiological properties limit their use for the production of proteins in their native form, especially polypeptides that are subjected to major post-translational modifications. Proteins that rely on disulfide bridges for their stability are difficult to produce in Escherichia coli. The bacterium offers the least costly, simplest, and fastest method for protein production. However, it is difficult to produce proteins with a very large size. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are the most commonly used yeast species for protein production. At a low expense, yeasts can offer high protein yields, generate proteins with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa, extract signal sequences, and glycosylate proteins. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species maintain reducing conditions in the cytoplasm. Hence, the formation of disulfide bonds is inhibited. These bonds are formed in eukaryotic cells during the export cycle, under the oxidizing conditions of the endoplasmic reticulum. Bacteria do not have an advanced subcellular space, but in the oxidizing periplasm, they exhibit both export systems and enzymatic activities directed at the formation and quality of disulfide bonds. Here, we discuss current techniques used to target eukaryotic and prokaryotic species for the generation of correctly folded proteins with disulfide bonds.",

It is considered non-toxigenic and non-pathogenic, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, White Oak, MD, USA) has approved several products prepared with help of this organism, and these products are generally accepted as safe substances (GRAS). In addition, it is an excellent host for the synthesis of recombinant proteins and offers additional benefits ranging from rapid growth to high cell density in an inexpensive and non-complex culture medium and facilitates the purification of recombinant proteins expressed heterologically [19][20][21]. \n\nE. coli expression systems are often used to produce exogenous protein on laboratory and industrial scales owing to the low cost, speed, and simplicity of cultivation [22]. E. coli strains DH5\u03b1 and Rosetta (DE3) have been used for the cloning of genes and the expression of proteins. E. coli is one of the earliest and most commonly used hosts for heterologous protein production [23,24]. The advantages and disadvantages are presented in Table 1. The advantages include rapid growth, fast expression, ease of cultivation, and high product yields [25][26][27]. It is used to manufacture large quantities of commercialized proteins. This method is particularly outstanding for the functional expression of non-glycosylated proteins. E. coli genetics are better understood than that of any other microorganism [28]. Recent advances in the understanding of the processes involved in coding, translation, and protein folding in E. coli and the use of advanced genetic instruments render this bacterium more useful than ever for the production of diverse eukaryotic proteins [29][30][31][32]. Its genome can be updated rapidly and reliably with ease. The regulation of promoter elements is not complex, and the number of plasmid copies can be easily adjusted. This method often adjusts the metabolic carbon supply, prevents the absorption of amino acid analogs, establishes intracellular disulfide bonds [33], and demonstrates a reproducible performance with computer control.",

However, their physiological properties limit their use for the production of proteins in their native form, especially polypeptides that are subjected to major post-translational modifications. Proteins that rely on disulfide bridges for their stability are difficult to produce in Escherichia coli. The bacterium offers the least costly, simplest, and fastest method for protein production. However, it is difficult to produce proteins with a very large size. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are the most commonly used yeast species for protein production. At a low expense, yeasts can offer high protein yields, generate proteins with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa, extract signal sequences, and glycosylate proteins. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species maintain reducing conditions in the cytoplasm. Hence, the formation of disulfide bonds is inhibited. These bonds are formed in eukaryotic cells during the export cycle, under the oxidizing conditions of the endoplasmic reticulum. Bacteria do not have an advanced subcellular space, but in the oxidizing periplasm, they exhibit both export systems and enzymatic activities directed at the formation and quality of disulfide bonds. Here, we discuss current techniques used to target eukaryotic and prokaryotic species for the generation of correctly folded proteins with disulfide bonds.\n## Host Strains for the Overexpression of Target Proteins\nThe methylotrophic yeast, P. pastoris, is a useful system for the production of genetically engineered enzymes (through heterologous gene expression) for both research and industrial purposes [18]. It is considered non-toxigenic and non-pathogenic, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, White Oak, MD, USA) has approved several products prepared with help of this organism, and these products are generally accepted as safe substances (GRAS). In addition, it is an excellent host for the synthesis of recombinant proteins and offers additional benefits ranging from rapid growth to high cell density in an inexpensive and non-complex culture medium and facilitates the purification of recombinant proteins expressed heterologically [19][20][21]. \n\nE. coli expression systems are often used to produce exogenous protein on laboratory and industrial scales owing to the low cost, speed, and simplicity of cultivation [22]. E. coli strains DH5\u03b1 and Rosetta (DE3) have been used for the cloning of genes and the expression of proteins. E. coli is one of the earliest and most commonly used hosts for heterologous protein production [23,24]. The advantages and disadvantages are presented in Table 1. The advantages include rapid growth, fast expression, ease of cultivation, and high product yields [25][26][27]. It is used to manufacture large quantities of commercialized proteins. This method is particularly outstanding for the functional expression of non-glycosylated proteins. E. coli genetics are better understood than that of any other microorganism [28]. Recent advances in the understanding of the processes involved in coding, translation, and protein folding in E. coli and the use of advanced genetic instruments render this bacterium more useful than ever for the production of diverse eukaryotic proteins [29][30][31][32]. Its genome can be updated rapidly and reliably with ease. The regulation of promoter elements is not complex, and the number of plasmid copies can be easily adjusted. This method often adjusts the metabolic carbon supply, prevents the absorption of amino acid analogs, establishes intracellular disulfide bonds [33], and demonstrates a reproducible performance with computer control.",

Four difficult-to-express protein models; i.e., CARDS TX, VEGFR-2, RVs and Omp85 were used in the assessment of Ffu fusion tags.ResultsThe expression levels and solubility of each protein were markedly enhanced by the Ffu fusion system. Each protein had a favorable Ffu tag. The Ffu fusion tags performed preferably when compared with the well-known fusion tags MBP and NusA. Strikingly, it was confirmed that Ffu fusion proteins were secreted into the periplasm by the periplasmic analysis and N-amino acid sequence analysis. Further, efficient excretion of HV3 with defined anti-thrombin activity was obtained when it was fused with the Ffu312 tag. Moreover, HV3 remained soluble and demonstrated notable anti-thrombin activity after the removal of the Ffu312 tag by enterokinase.ConclusionsObservations from this work not only complements fusion technologies, but also develops a novel and effective secretory system to solve key issues that include inclusion bodies and degradation when expressing heterologous proteins in E. coli, especially for proteins that require disulfide bond formation, eukaryotic-secreted proteins, and membrane-associated proteins.",

Four difficult-to-express protein models; i.e., CARDS TX, VEGFR-2, RVs and Omp85 were used in the assessment of Ffu fusion tags.ResultsThe expression levels and solubility of each protein were markedly enhanced by the Ffu fusion system. Each protein had a favorable Ffu tag. The Ffu fusion tags performed preferably when compared with the well-known fusion tags MBP and NusA. Strikingly, it was confirmed that Ffu fusion proteins were secreted into the periplasm by the periplasmic analysis and N-amino acid sequence analysis. Further, efficient excretion of HV3 with defined anti-thrombin activity was obtained when it was fused with the Ffu312 tag. Moreover, HV3 remained soluble and demonstrated notable anti-thrombin activity after the removal of the Ffu312 tag by enterokinase.ConclusionsObservations from this work not only complements fusion technologies, but also develops a novel and effective secretory system to solve key issues that include inclusion bodies and degradation when expressing heterologous proteins in E. coli, especially for proteins that require disulfide bond formation, eukaryotic-secreted proteins, and membrane-associated proteins.\n## Background\nIn recent research, Escherichia coli (E. coli) has established itself as one of the most extensively used systems in the industrial production of recombinant proteins, which owes much to the high yield of production that is possible with this system, the low manufacturing cost, a wellcharacterized expression system, and amenability to high cell-density fermentation biotechnology [1,2].

            "abstract": "The emergence of recombinant DNA technology during the early 70's set a revolution in molecular biology. This set of techniques was strengthened even further later on with the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction and allowed scientists to explore and understand essential life processes in an easy and straightforward way. It also marked the birth of the modern biotech industry. At that time, it was shown that eukaryotic DNA could be propagated in Escherichia coli (Morrow et al., 1974) and functional products could be synthesized from heterologous genes cloned in bacterial plasmids (Ratzkin and Carbon, 1977; Vapnek et al., 1977). After these successful cases, it was soon realized that the potential applications of these techniques were almost limitless. In fact, US patent 4,237,224 granted to Cohen and Boyer (1980) claimed to commercial ownership of the methodology for cloning virtually all possible DNAs in all possible vectors. While cloning any gene in any given vector is feasible, obtaining a functional product from its expression is not that simple. \n \nIn this series of articles, the authors describe the methods and technologies available for producing recombinant proteins in different microbes. They also introduce and discuss recent advances that attempt to tackle common pitfalls in the process. Taken together, this E-book will be of great importance for those entering the field as well as for experienced researchers that are looking for an update in the state of the art. \n \nBefore proceeding any further, it is necessary to clarify an important aspect of this topic. In biology, the universal accepted definition of \u201cexpression\u201d is \u201cproduction of an observable phenotype by a gene\u2014usually by directing the synthesis of a protein\u201d (Alberts et al., 2002). By this definition, the term \u201cgene expression\u201d is correct while \u201cprotein expression\u201d is basically lab jargon. We do think that correct usage of scientific language is of great importance, yet in this particular case, the usage of \u201cprotein expression\u201d in the scientific community is so pervasive that readers will immediately understand what we are talking about. So, considering that \u201cprotein expression\u201d found its way into journal names, book names and high-impact reviews (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005) and research papers (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003) (>1800 citations in Scopus) we and other authors have used it interchangeably with more correct terms like protein production or protein synthesis.",

It has been used for this purpose for more than 40 years, so there is much accumulated knowledge about its advantages and disadvantages as an expression platform. Rosano and Ceccarelli review the tools at hand (expression vectors, strains, media composition, etc.) when using E. coli as a host (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Different approaches for solving common problems, such as inclusion body (IB) formation or low yield, are also presented. \n\nOther authors delve a little deeper into these issues. Costa and coauthors give a thorough description of different fusion tags that can be appended to the target protein in order to increase its solubility and/or ease its purification from the cellular milieu (Costa et al., 2014). Along this line, Correa and coauthors present a very promising approach to straightforwardly assess the solubility of a recombinant protein by cloning the corresponding gene in 12 different expression vectors in parallel (Correa et al., 2014). Even though IB formation is mainly regarded as a nuance in the production of recombinant proteins, Ramon and coworkers make the case that this is not always true and focus on the positive side of IBs, highlighting the advantages of producing recombinant proteins as IBs for basic and applied research (Ramon et al., 2014). No or low yield can be the result of codon bias and Elena and coauthors look into one of the strategies used for solving this problem, the expression of codon optimized genes (Elena et al., 2014). Of great importance is their account of the application of this technology in the industrial setting. Not always the desired product is a protein, sometimes metabolites and fine chemicals are the goal. The review of Ceccoli and coauthors details with numerous examples how E. coli and other microorganisms can be turned into biocatalysts by strain engineering (Ceccoli et al., 2014). High-value products can thus be obtained from pure recombinant enzyme or from whole-cell systems, turning the host into an exquisitely designed and environmentally friendly chemical factory.",

Ceccarelli\n## Abstract\nThe emergence of recombinant DNA technology during the early 70's set a revolution in molecular biology. This set of techniques was strengthened even further later on with the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction and allowed scientists to explore and understand essential life processes in an easy and straightforward way. It also marked the birth of the modern biotech industry. At that time, it was shown that eukaryotic DNA could be propagated in Escherichia coli (Morrow et al., 1974) and functional products could be synthesized from heterologous genes cloned in bacterial plasmids (Ratzkin and Carbon, 1977; Vapnek et al., 1977). After these successful cases, it was soon realized that the potential applications of these techniques were almost limitless. In fact, US patent 4,237,224 granted to Cohen and Boyer (1980) claimed to commercial ownership of the methodology for cloning virtually all possible DNAs in all possible vectors. While cloning any gene in any given vector is feasible, obtaining a functional product from its expression is not that simple. \n \nIn this series of articles, the authors describe the methods and technologies available for producing recombinant proteins in different microbes. They also introduce and discuss recent advances that attempt to tackle common pitfalls in the process. Taken together, this E-book will be of great importance for those entering the field as well as for experienced researchers that are looking for an update in the state of the art. \n \nBefore proceeding any further, it is necessary to clarify an important aspect of this topic. In biology, the universal accepted definition of \u201cexpression\u201d is \u201cproduction of an observable phenotype by a gene\u2014usually by directing the synthesis of a protein\u201d (Alberts et al., 2002). By this definition, the term \u201cgene expression\u201d is correct while \u201cprotein expression\u201d is basically lab jargon. We do think that correct usage of scientific language is of great importance, yet in this particular case, the usage of \u201cprotein expression\u201d in the scientific community is so pervasive that readers will immediately understand what we are talking about. So, considering that \u201cprotein expression\u201d found its way into journal names, book names and high-impact reviews (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005) and research papers (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003) (>1800 citations in Scopus) we and other authors have used it interchangeably with more correct terms like protein production or protein synthesis.\n## CURRENT STATUS IN RECOMBINANT PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN MICROBIAL SYSTEMS\nWithout a doubt, E. coli is the most widely used host for heterologous gene expression. It has been used for this purpose for more than 40 years, so there is much accumulated knowledge about its advantages and disadvantages as an expression platform. Rosano and Ceccarelli review the tools at hand (expression vectors, strains, media composition, etc.) when using E. coli as a host (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Different approaches for solving common problems, such as inclusion body (IB) formation or low yield, are also presented. \n\nOther authors delve a little deeper into these issues. Costa and coauthors give a thorough description of different fusion tags that can be appended to the target protein in order to increase its solubility and/or ease its purification from the cellular milieu (Costa et al., 2014). Along this line, Correa and coauthors present a very promising approach to straightforwardly assess the solubility of a recombinant protein by cloning the corresponding gene in 12 different expression vectors in parallel (Correa et al., 2014). Even though IB formation is mainly regarded as a nuance in the production of recombinant proteins, Ramon and coworkers make the case that this is not always true and focus on the positive side of IBs, highlighting the advantages of producing recombinant proteins as IBs for basic and applied research (Ramon et al., 2014). No or low yield can be the result of codon bias and Elena and coauthors look into one of the strategies used for solving this problem, the expression of codon optimized genes (Elena et al., 2014). Of great importance is their account of the application of this technology in the industrial setting. Not always the desired product is a protein, sometimes metabolites and fine chemicals are the goal. The review of Ceccoli and coauthors details with numerous examples how E. coli and other microorganisms can be turned into biocatalysts by strain engineering (Ceccoli et al., 2014). High-value products can thus be obtained from pure recombinant enzyme or from whole-cell systems, turning the host into an exquisitely designed and environmentally friendly chemical factory.",

Moreover, it presented a relatively poor purification performance for extracts derived from yeast, Drosophila, and HeLa cells (Lichty et al., 2005).",

A new era began in the biopharmaceutical industry with the production of insulin, the first recombinant protein, in E. coli and its use in treating diabetes. After insulin, many biopharmaceuticals produced from E. coli have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency to treat various human diseases. Although E. coli has some disadvantages, such as lack of post\u2010translational modifications and toxicity, it is an important host with advantages such as being a well\u2010known bacterium in recombinant protein production, cheap, simple production system, and high yield. This study examined biopharmaceuticals produced and approved in E. coli under the headings of peptides, hormones, enzymes, fusion proteins, antibody fragments, vaccines, and other pharmaceuticals. The topics on which these biopharmaceuticals were approved for treating human diseases, when and by which company they were produced, and their use and development in the field are included.\n",

Here, we mimic the late phase of bacteriophage infection by co-expressing a phage-derived xenogeneic regulator that reprograms the host cell and thereby are able to significantly improve RPP under industrial relevant fed-batch process conditions at bioreactor scale. We have evaluated production of several different recombinant proteins at different scales (from microscale to 20 L fed-batch scale) and have been able to improve total and soluble proteins yields up to 3.4-fold in comparison to the reference expression system E. coli BL21(DE3). This novel approach for growth-decoupled RPP has profound implications for biotechnology and bioengineering and helps to establish more cost-effective and generic manufacturing processes for biologics and biomaterials.\n",

However, the foam generated by the lysophospholipid product makes the fermentation process difficult to control in a fermentor. Phospholipase C (PLC) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids to produce sn1,2-diacylglycerides and organic phosphate, which do not induce foam formation. Therefore, co-expression with Bacillus cereus PLC was investigated as a method to improve the extracellular production of recombinant proteins.ResultsWhen B. cereus PLC was expressed in Escherichia coli without its signal peptide, 95.3% of the total PLC activity was detected in the culture supernatant. PLC expression enhanced membrane permeability without obvious cell lysis. Then, six test enzymes, three secretory and three cytosolic, were co-expressed with B. cereus PLC. The enhancement of extracellular production correlated strongly with the molecular mass of the test enzyme. Extracellular production of Streptomyces sp. FA1 xylanase (43\u00a0kDa), which had the lowest molecular mass among the secretory enzymes, was 4.0-fold that of its individual expression control. Extracellular production of glutamate decarboxylase (51\u00a0kDa), which had the lowest molecular mass among the cytosolic enzymes, reached 26.7 U/mL; 88.3% of the total activity produced. This strategy was effectively scaled up using a 3-L fermentor. No obvious foam was generated during this fermentation process.ConclusionsThis is the first study to detail the enhanced extracellular production of recombinant proteins through co-expression with PLC. This new strategy, which is especially appropriate for lower molecular mass proteins, allows large-scale protein production in an easily controlled fermentation process.",

Jiang, Lingang Yu, Jing Wu\n## Abstract\nBackgroundOur laboratory has reported a strategy for improving the extracellular production of recombinant proteins through co-expression with Thermobifida fusca cutinase, which increases membrane permeability via its phospholipid hydrolysis activity. However, the foam generated by the lysophospholipid product makes the fermentation process difficult to control in a fermentor. Phospholipase C (PLC) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids to produce sn1,2-diacylglycerides and organic phosphate, which do not induce foam formation. Therefore, co-expression with Bacillus cereus PLC was investigated as a method to improve the extracellular production of recombinant proteins.ResultsWhen B. cereus PLC was expressed in Escherichia coli without its signal peptide, 95.3% of the total PLC activity was detected in the culture supernatant. PLC expression enhanced membrane permeability without obvious cell lysis. Then, six test enzymes, three secretory and three cytosolic, were co-expressed with B. cereus PLC. The enhancement of extracellular production correlated strongly with the molecular mass of the test enzyme. Extracellular production of Streptomyces sp. FA1 xylanase (43\u00a0kDa), which had the lowest molecular mass among the secretory enzymes, was 4.0-fold that of its individual expression control. Extracellular production of glutamate decarboxylase (51\u00a0kDa), which had the lowest molecular mass among the cytosolic enzymes, reached 26.7 U/mL; 88.3% of the total activity produced. This strategy was effectively scaled up using a 3-L fermentor. No obvious foam was generated during this fermentation process.ConclusionsThis is the first study to detail the enhanced extracellular production of recombinant proteins through co-expression with PLC. This new strategy, which is especially appropriate for lower molecular mass proteins, allows large-scale protein production in an easily controlled fermentation process.\n## Background\nEscherichia coli is the most widely studied and frequently used host for recombinant protein production because its genetics are well-characterized, the culture periods are short, and protein production levels are high [1][2][3]. Because E. coli has both inner and outer membranes, recombinant proteins produced in this host can localize to the cytoplasm, the periplasm, or the culture medium [2,4]. Production of recombinant proteins in the culture medium is the most desirable of these alternatives, whether the protein is produced on an analytical or industrial scale, because the protein being produced experiences superior protein folding, requires a simpler extraction procedure, and is contaminated with fewer proteins [1,5]. Unfortunately, E. coli is a relatively poor secretor of proteins, which is a significant barrier to the application to this methodology [6]. \n\nMany attempts have been made to enhance the extracellular production of recombinant secretory proteins in E. coli, and some success has been achieved [2,6]. Two different approaches have been pursued. In one approach, protein secretion was enhanced through co-expression or modification of transport proteins [7][8][9][10]. The validity and universality of this approach may be compromised by the complexity and regulatory mechanisms associated with protein secretion systems. The other approach was to enhance nonspecific leakage of the recombinant proteins through the host cell membranes by constructing hosts with a leaky phenotype.

            "abstract": "The development of the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), an in vitro protein misfolding amplification assay, was an innovation in the scientific field of protein misfolding diseases. In prion diseases, these types of assays imitate the pathological conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrP^C) into a protease-resistant and/or amyloid form of PrP, called PrP resistant (PrP^Res). The RT-QuIC is an automatic assay system based on real-time measuring of thioflavin-T (Th-T) incorporation into amyloid fibrils using shaking for disaggregation. It has already\u00a0been applied in diagnostics, drug pre-screening, and to distinguish between different prion strains. The seeded conversion efficiency and the diagnostic accuracy of the RT-QuIC assay strongly depend on the kind of recombinant PrP (rec PrP) substrate. The DNA sequences of different substrates may originate from different species, such as human, bank vole, and hamster, or from a combination of two species, e.g., hamster-sheep chimera. In routine use, either full-length (FL) or truncated substrates are applied which can accelerate the conversion reaction, e.g., to a more sensitive version of RT-QuIC assay. In the present review, we provide an overview on the different types of PrP substrates (FL and truncated forms), recapitulate the production and purification process of different rec PrP substrates, and discuss the diagnostic value of CSF RT-QuIC in human prion disease diagnostics.",

                    "text": "Multiple protein expression systems are available for the production of recombinant proteins, e.g., bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. However, Escherichia coli is the host system widely used in the production of the rec PrP due to multiple significant benefits over other expression systems including a well-established protein overexpression protocol, low costs, ease of use, and scale (Terpe 2006). A vast number of Escherichia coli strains as well as plasmid vectors with a variety of choices of promoters, affinity tags, and antibiotic resistance are commercially available with the purpose to confer the best results of transformation in the Escherichia coli and an ultimate yield in protein expression. Due to the intrinsic affinity of the PrP C for metals, the additional His-tag sequence is not needed as fusion to PrP to obtain a simple and faster protein purification (Csire et al. 2020;Jackson et al. 2001;Schmitz et al. 2016a). PrP expression in Escherichia coli can be achieved overnight by using autoinduction media or by IPTG protocols (Fig. 1). Commercial or homemade auto-induction media have preferentially been used for the expression of recombinant proteins due to being convenient since the bacterial growth does not need to be measured and due to a higher yield of protein (several-fold higher than conventional IPTG induction systems) (Grabski et al. 2005;Studier 2005). The majority of rec PrP is localized in the inclusion bodies. The isolation of these inclusion bodies can be achieved by a purification protocol for inclusion bodies (Palmer and Wingfield 2004) or with the use of BugBuster Master Mix buffer, which so far is the most effective and fastest method (Fig. 1) (Bourkas et al. 2019). It allows a maximal recovery of functional proteins from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. After purification, inclusion bodies are denatured (by guanidine or urea buffer) with the purpose to release the overexpressed proteins in the supernatant.",

Schmitz, Andr\u00e9 Fischer, Peter Hermann, I. Zerr\n## Abstract\nThe development of the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), an in vitro protein misfolding amplification assay, was an innovation in the scientific field of protein misfolding diseases. In prion diseases, these types of assays imitate the pathological conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrP^C) into a protease-resistant and/or amyloid form of PrP, called PrP resistant (PrP^Res). The RT-QuIC is an automatic assay system based on real-time measuring of thioflavin-T (Th-T) incorporation into amyloid fibrils using shaking for disaggregation. It has already\u00a0been applied in diagnostics, drug pre-screening, and to distinguish between different prion strains. The seeded conversion efficiency and the diagnostic accuracy of the RT-QuIC assay strongly depend on the kind of recombinant PrP (rec PrP) substrate. The DNA sequences of different substrates may originate from different species, such as human, bank vole, and hamster, or from a combination of two species, e.g., hamster-sheep chimera. In routine use, either full-length (FL) or truncated substrates are applied which can accelerate the conversion reaction, e.g., to a more sensitive version of RT-QuIC assay. In the present review, we provide an overview on the different types of PrP substrates (FL and truncated forms), recapitulate the production and purification process of different rec PrP substrates, and discuss the diagnostic value of CSF RT-QuIC in human prion disease diagnostics.\n## Production of recombinant PrP substrates\nMultiple protein expression systems are available for the production of recombinant proteins, e.g., bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. However, Escherichia coli is the host system widely used in the production of the rec PrP due to multiple significant benefits over other expression systems including a well-established protein overexpression protocol, low costs, ease of use, and scale (Terpe 2006). A vast number of Escherichia coli strains as well as plasmid vectors with a variety of choices of promoters, affinity tags, and antibiotic resistance are commercially available with the purpose to confer the best results of transformation in the Escherichia coli and an ultimate yield in protein expression. Due to the intrinsic affinity of the PrP C for metals, the additional His-tag sequence is not needed as fusion to PrP to obtain a simple and faster protein purification (Csire et al. 2020;Jackson et al. 2001;Schmitz et al. 2016a). PrP expression in Escherichia coli can be achieved overnight by using autoinduction media or by IPTG protocols (Fig. 1). Commercial or homemade auto-induction media have preferentially been used for the expression of recombinant proteins due to being convenient since the bacterial growth does not need to be measured and due to a higher yield of protein (several-fold higher than conventional IPTG induction systems) (Grabski et al. 2005;Studier 2005). The majority of rec PrP is localized in the inclusion bodies. The isolation of these inclusion bodies can be achieved by a purification protocol for inclusion bodies (Palmer and Wingfield 2004) or with the use of BugBuster Master Mix buffer, which so far is the most effective and fastest method (Fig. 1) (Bourkas et al. 2019). It allows a maximal recovery of functional proteins from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. After purification, inclusion bodies are denatured (by guanidine or urea buffer) with the purpose to release the overexpressed proteins in the supernatant.",

Aparin\n## Abstract\nCross-reacting material 197 (CRM197) is a non-toxic mutant of the diphtheria toxin and is widely used as a carrier protein in conjugate vaccines. This protein was first obtained from the supernatant of the mutant Corynebacterium diphtheriae strain. This pathogenic bacteria strain is characterized by a slow growth rate and a relatively low target protein yield, resulting in high production costs for CRM197. Many attempts have been made to establish high-yield protocols for the heterologous expression of recombinant CRM197 in different host organisms. In the present work, a novel CRM197-producing Escherichia coli strain was constructed. The target protein was expressed in the cytoplasm of SHuffle T7 E. coli cells without any additional tags and with a single potential mutation\u2014an additional Met [\u22121]. The fine tuning of the mRNA structure (the disruption of the single hairpin in the start codon area) was sufficient to increase the CRM197 expression level several times, resulting in 150\u2013270 mg/L (1.1\u20132.0 mg/g wet biomass) yields of pure CRM197 protein. Besides the high yield, the advantages of the obtained expression system include the absence of the necessity of CRM197 refolding or tag removal. Thus, an extensive analysis of the mRNA structure and the removal of the unwanted hairpins in the 5\u2032 area may significantly improve the target protein expression rate.\n## Introduction\nTaken together, these facts lead to the high cost of purified CRM197 and encourage the search for alternative expression hosts. \n\nThe heterologous expression of recombinant CRM197 was tested in a broad range of organisms such as E. coli [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20], Bacillus subtilis [21,22], Pseudomonas fluorescens [23], attenuated Salmonella typhi [24], and Pichia pastoris [25], along with low-alkaloid tobacco plants and carrot cell cultures [26].

In most cases, especially when high levels of target proteins are required, plasmid-borne expression is the method of choice for this purpose. The availability of a plethora of E. coli plasmid expression vectors with various promoters, selection markers, purification tags, fusion partners and auxiliary proteins has greatly simplified the process of cloning and expression in this microorganism. However, there are certain situations where integrating the gene of interest into the chromosome of the host may be advantageous over plasmid-based systems. For example, when the function of the target gene needs to be evaluated under physiological conditions, variations in plasmid copy number and, consequently, expression levels can affect the results and may complicate the interpretation of the obtained data (1, 2). Similarly, in metabolic engineering where expression stability is considered of primary importance chromosomal integration offers certain advantages (3). Even in cases when E. coli is being used simply as a host to obtain high levels of heterologous recombinant proteins for in vitro analyses, chromosomal integration of the corresponding gene under the control of a strong exogenous promoter may be used as a reliable alternative to plasmid-borne protein expression (4). Several methods for the integration of the gene of interest in the genome of E. coli are available and both the site-specific and homologous recombination pathways have been exploited for this purpose. Methods based on site-specific recombination include the FLP/FRT, Cre/loxP and Int/att systems (2, 5, 6). In most cases, the enzymatic activity required for these processes are provided on helper plasmids. The gene of interest is inserted into an integrative plasmid containing the corresponding recognition sequence and a selectable marker and transformed into a host carrying the required enzymatic function. These systems can be used to integrate very large constructs. However, insertion can only occur in a limited number of pre-existing recognition sequences in the host genome (7). Methods based on homologous recombination, on the other hand, can be used to integrate the target gene into virtually any position in the host genome but are limited to smaller constructs. As the size of the construct increases, the efficiency of the integration decreases to the point that at construct sizes larger than 2.5-3.5 kb practically no recombinant clones can be obtained (7). Homologous recombination-based methods may employ the E. coli recombination machinery (8) or may depend on \u2026\n",

The current study provides gene multimerization strategy as an alternate way to amplify the gene dosage and explores its effect on the expression of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) by constructing three types of expression vectors i.e., pET28-EGF-C1, pET28-EGF-C2 and pET28-EGF-C3, each containing single, double and triple expression cassettes, respectively.

Bacterial strain, E. coli has been used to produce biopharmaceutical products such as insulin, interferon, human growth factors and other recombinant proteins (Tripathi, 2016). Bacterial strain E. coli offers different advantages, such as easy to grow, high growth rate and cheap media demands. Moreover, its cellular components and genetics are well studied, which make it a host, that can bear fruitful genetic manipulations for expression of recombinant proteins (Joseph et al., 2015;Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;Sivashanmugam et al., 2009;Tripathi, 2016). However, in spite of all these advantages, protein production in bacterial expression system, has never been a straight forward method. Certain disadvantages such as lack of post-translational modifications, formation of inclusion bodies, protein toxicity etc. may result in production of proteins either with improper structure and function or with no or very low yield (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Different methodologies have been developed to target those factors that might be responsible for the problem of low yield in bacterial expression system. Briefly, these methodologies can be broadly classified as (i) those dealing with optimization of bioprocessing and culture conditions and (ii) those that deal at molecular level for enhancement of protein production, such as strain engineering, increased plasmid number, codon optimization and genetic manipulations of certain genetic elements. \n\nOptimization of bioprocessing and culturing conditions include several strategies. For enhanced production of recombinant proteins, usually cultures with high cell densities are preferred in batch and fed-batch fermentation processes. Cultures can either be induced or grown in auto-induction media for enhanced production of recombinant proteins in a regulated way (Sivashanmugam et al., 2009).

Sainz-Pastor, N. Merino, M. Compte, L. Sanz, F. Blanco, L. \u00c1lvarez-Vallina\n## Abstract\nRecombinant antibodies are used with great success in many different diagnostic and therapeutic applications. A variety of protein expression systems are available, but nowadays almost all therapeutic antibodies are produced in mammalian cell lines due to their complex structure and glycosylation requirements. However, production of clinical-grade antibodies in mammalian cells is very expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is known to be the simplest, fastest and most cost-effective recombinant expression system, which usually achieves higher protein yields than mammalian cells. Indeed, it is one of the most popular host in the industry for the expression of recombinant proteins. In this work, a trivalent single-chain fragment variable (scFv)-based N-terminal trimerbody, specific for native laminin-111, was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in E. coli. Mammalian and bacterially produced anti-laminin trimerbody molecules display comparable functional and structural properties, although importantly the yield of trimerbody expressed in E. coli was considerably higher than in human cells. These results demonstrated that E. coli is a versatile and efficient expression system for multivalent trimerbody-based molecules that is suitable for their industrial production.\n",

The present review provides an overview of the recent advances in the synthetic biology of natural drugs. Particular attention is paid to the investigations of drugs that may be mass-produced by the pharmaceutical industry after optimization of the corresponding synthetic systems. The present review describes the reconstruction and optimization of biosynthetic pathways for nine drugs, including seven drugs from plant sources and two drugs from microbial sources, suggesting a new strategy for the large-scale preparation of some rare natural plant metabolites and highly bioactive microbial compounds. Some of the suggested synthetic methods remain in a preliminary exploration stage; however, a number of these methods demonstrated considerable application potential. The authors also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the application of synthetic biology and various expression systems for heterologous expression of natural drugs. Thus, the present review provides a useful perspective for researchers attempting to use synthetic biology to produce natural drugs.",

E. coli is mainly used for cloning, genetic modification, and small-scale production, and the mechanisms of these processes have been thoroughly studied. E. coli has been widely used in the studies of heterologous medicinal proteins because of its clearly defined genetic background, fast reproduction, low cost, high expression level, stable 2 H/ 13 C/ 15 N isotope labeling technology, and wide range of applications (Nuc and Nuc, 2006). However, as a prokaryote, E. coli has no regulatory mechanism for eukaryotic gene expression and it lacks the ability to catalyze posttranslational modifications (PTMs), especially modifications catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which severely limits its application as a recombinant drug factory. PTMs play important roles in the folding, processing, stability, glycosylation, final biological activity, and immunogenicity of the proteins. A previous study has shown that transfer of the N-linked glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni to E. coli may produce glycosylated proteins (Wacker et al., 2002). Deficiency of the E. coli expression system for pharmaceutical protein production was overcome by a series of optimization strategies, such as codon optimization (Burgess-Brown et al., 2008), vector construction (Hayashi and Kojima, 2008), development of a new secretion system to reduce inclusion body formation (Cheng et al., 2017), and self-induction (Briand et al., 2016), to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli and to determine the best strategy. \n\nBacillus subtilis is an alternate host for the expression and secretion of heterologous proteins in some cases. Comparison with E. coli indicates that B. subtilis has strong protein secretion ability and does not easily form inclusion bodies. Moreover, B. subtilis is not pathogenic and has been used as a cell factory for producing enzymes, vitamins, and functional sugars in the expression systems for over a decade (van Dijl and Hecker, 2013).",

These compounds play a very important role in the protection of human health and treatment of human diseases. Sustainable approaches to the generation of raw materials for pharmaceutical products have been extensively investigated in drug research and development because chemical synthesis is costly and generates pollution. The present review provides an overview of the recent advances in the synthetic biology of natural drugs. Particular attention is paid to the investigations of drugs that may be mass-produced by the pharmaceutical industry after optimization of the corresponding synthetic systems. The present review describes the reconstruction and optimization of biosynthetic pathways for nine drugs, including seven drugs from plant sources and two drugs from microbial sources, suggesting a new strategy for the large-scale preparation of some rare natural plant metabolites and highly bioactive microbial compounds. Some of the suggested synthetic methods remain in a preliminary exploration stage; however, a number of these methods demonstrated considerable application potential. The authors also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the application of synthetic biology and various expression systems for heterologous expression of natural drugs. Thus, the present review provides a useful perspective for researchers attempting to use synthetic biology to produce natural drugs.\n## Prokaryotic Expression Systems\nEscherichia coli is a preferred microorganism for the production of recombinant proteins. E. coli is mainly used for cloning, genetic modification, and small-scale production, and the mechanisms of these processes have been thoroughly studied. E. coli has been widely used in the studies of heterologous medicinal proteins because of its clearly defined genetic background, fast reproduction, low cost, high expression level, stable 2 H/ 13 C/ 15 N isotope labeling technology, and wide range of applications (Nuc and Nuc, 2006). However, as a prokaryote, E. coli has no regulatory mechanism for eukaryotic gene expression and it lacks the ability to catalyze posttranslational modifications (PTMs), especially modifications catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which severely limits its application as a recombinant drug factory. PTMs play important roles in the folding, processing, stability, glycosylation, final biological activity, and immunogenicity of the proteins. A previous study has shown that transfer of the N-linked glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni to E. coli may produce glycosylated proteins (Wacker et al., 2002). Deficiency of the E. coli expression system for pharmaceutical protein production was overcome by a series of optimization strategies, such as codon optimization (Burgess-Brown et al., 2008), vector construction (Hayashi and Kojima, 2008), development of a new secretion system to reduce inclusion body formation (Cheng et al., 2017), and self-induction (Briand et al., 2016), to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli and to determine the best strategy. \n\nBacillus subtilis is an alternate host for the expression and secretion of heterologous proteins in some cases. Comparison with E. coli indicates that B. subtilis has strong protein secretion ability and does not easily form inclusion bodies. Moreover, B. subtilis is not pathogenic and has been used as a cell factory for producing enzymes, vitamins, and functional sugars in the expression systems for over a decade (van Dijl and Hecker, 2013).",

            "text": "Recombinant protein expression has revolutionized all aspects of the biological sciences. Most significantly, it has dramatically expanded the number of proteins that can be investigated both biochemically and structurally. Previously, protein production was the domain of experts, as purification from a natural source (i.e., plants, rabbits, bovine) was often difficult and time consuming. However, the availability of new commercial systems for recombinant protein expression, combined with advanced protein purification techniques, has made protein production prevalent throughout the biological and biomedical sciences. This has enabled the research community to study thousands of low abundance and novel proteins from a large variety of organisms. Notably, 31 recombinant proteins were approved for therapeutic use between 2003 and 2006, highlighting the importance of heterologous protein expression in biopharmaceutical research (Walsh, 2006). As the number of recombinantly produced proteins increases, so too does an appreciation for the difficulties and limitations inherent to this process.\n\nIn spite of the development of multiple nonbacterial recombinant expression systems over the last three decades (yeast, baculovirus, mammalian cell, cell free systems; see Table 5.24.1), Escherichia coli is still the preferred host for recombinant protein expression (Yin et al., 2007). The rationale is clear: E. coli is easy to genetically manipulate, it is inexpensive to culture, and expression is fast, with proteins routinely produced in one day. Moreover, protocols for isotope-labeling for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine incorporation for X-ray crystallography are well established, making it highly suitable for structural studies. Thus, E. coli has multiple, significant benefits over other expression systems including cost, ease-of-use, and scale.\n\nDespite its many advantages and widespread use, there are also disadvantages to using E. coli as an expression host. In contrast to eukaryotic systems, transcription and translation are fast and tightly coupled. Since many eukaryotic proteins require longer times and/or the assistance of folding chaperones to fold into their native state, this rate enhancement often leads to a pool  Spirin, 2004;Langlais et al., 2007; for other references, see text.\n\nof partially folded, unfolded, or misfolded,",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role. These include the basic choice of the expression system design, like plasmid-based or genome-integrated expression cassettes, and, in this regard, the copy number of the plasmid and the gene of interest (GOI) [2,6]. Also, a suitable promotor system for high level protein expression must be employed and the mRNA has to have an appropriate stability for recombinant protein expression [6]. Furthermore, the choice of fermentation process and parameters, the media composition and induction strategy play a major role for high-yield recombinant protein production [6]. \n\nAlongside all these factors, the optimization of translation initiation, which is the rate limiting and most tightly regulated step in protein biosynthesis, has received much attention in the last two decades [10].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one among the earliest and most commonly used host organism for protein expression (Terpe, 2006) due to the fast growth and expression, ease of culture and high yields (Swartz, 1996). Moreover, the genetics of E. coli are wellunderstood when compared to other organisms. Despite its great advantages, E. coli has certain drawbacks that can possibly influence the production efficiency of recombinant proteins. This is because a high cell density of this organism results in large quantities of acetate, which is toxic to cells. It is also reported through studies that this organism fails to produce very large proteins. Additionally, some issues were observed for E. coli system in terms of difficulties in producing proteins that have disulfide bonds and refolding ability. Another factor is the failure to produce modified protein due to the absence of glycosylation (Jenkins and Curling, 1994). Glycosylation affects properties such as solubility, stability functionality, immunogenicity, etc. In order to achieve glycosylation for attaining a stable and properly folded protein, a higher advantage is noticed for recombinant production in yeast, mold, insect or mammalian cells. A solution can be opting for secretion of the heterologous protein into the medium instead of intracellular inclusion bodies. This way, soluble and active proteins can be attained with a much easier downstream processing and cost reduction (Mergulh\u00e3o et al., 2005). Emergence of other bacterial systems can also be noticed over the years in the field of recombinant protein production. The engineering of Lactococcus lactis, a gram-positive bacterium for membrane protein expression is one such example (Chen, 2012). Additionally, they also possess advantages over E. coli in terms of being GRAS and endotoxin free (Yeh et al., 2009). Pseudomonas species such as P. fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida, were also found as suitable alternatives to E. coli expression systems to attain higher yields of the recombinant protein. Today, several other bacterial systems are widely explored as cell factories.",

            "text": "The majority of recombinant proteins is currently produced by genetic engineering, using a variety of expression systems: recombinant prokaryotic and eukaryotic strains (e.g. cell lines and yeasts), plants or transgenic organisms. These systems are readily available, safe and provide the possibility of changing the amino acid sequence of proteins in order to better adapt the final product to its function in the body. Choosing the right expression system (host and vector) is the key step in the production of biopharmaceuticals.\n\nThe features that support the use of microorganisms for the production of recombinant proteins are their diversity, metabolic potential and the ability to adapt to different environmental conditions [12]. Bacteria are the most frequently selected microorganisms, especially Escherichia coli. The use of bacteria is cost-effective due to low production costs, easy manipulation in the genome, fast growth rate and the possibility of using many molecular methods enabling to work with them at the cellular and molecular level. Bacteria are ideal for the production of low molecular weight proteins that do not require post-translational modifications [37].\n\nBacteria of the species E. coli strains are the most frequently the microbes of choice used for a large-scale production of proteins due to the well-known genome sequence, the best-defined transcription and translation system, the large selection of promoters described, the ease of genetic manipulation and the well-known metabolic and regulation pathways [23,36]. About 30% of proteins with therapeutic properties, approved for use by the FDA, are produced in this host [3]. A high level of protein expression can be obtained in E. coli strains, by applying strong promoters. Moreover, E. coli can accumulate recombinant proteins in an amount of up to 80% of its dry matter, and is characterized by the ability to survive in various environmental conditions [15]. These bacteria multiply quickly on relatively inex pensive substrates, and the large-scale recombinant protein synthesis process in bioreactors has been well studies and described [59]. Currently, the K-12 E. coli strain and its derivatives [49,75] are routinely used in production. Despite the use of E. coli strains as the system of choice, these microorganisms are",

They play important roles in a variety of cell processes, including cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle, and their failure is consequently correlated with several diseases.\n\nWith the introduction of the DNA recombinant technology in the 1970s, proteins started to be expressed in several host organisms resulting in a faster and easier process compared to their natural sources (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). Escherichia coli remains the dominant host for producing recombinant proteins, owing to its advantageous fast and inexpensive, and high yield protein production, together with the well-characterized genetics and variety of available molecular tools (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009).\n\nThe recombinant protein production in E. coli has greatly contributed for several structural studies; for instance, about 90% of the structures available in the Protein Data Bank were determined on proteins produced in E. coli. (Nettleship et al., 2010;Bird, 2011). The E. coli recombinant production has also boosted the biopharmaceutical industry: 30% of the recombinant biopharmaceuticals licensed up to 2011 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) were obtained using this host cell (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Walsh, 2010;Berlec and Strukelj, 2013).\n\nEscherichia coli recombinant protein-based products can also be found in major sectors of the enzyme industry and the agricultural industry with applications ranging from catalysis (e.g., washing detergents) and therapeutic use (e.g., vaccine development) to functional analysis and structure determination (e.g., crystallography; Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). As a bacterial system, the E. coli has, however, limitations at expressing more complex proteins due to the lack of sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications, resulting in poor solubility of the protein of interest that are produced as inclusion bodies (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Kamionka, 2011).

Moreover, among the 239 US-FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved therapeutic peptides and proteins, as well as their 380 drug variants, the majority are manufactured by recombinant protein production [1]. \n\nIn both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media [2], which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium [2]. Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics [4,5]. \n\nA commonly encountered problem for recombinant protein production is impeded cell growth or reduced biomass accumulation. There are two major reasons for this phenomenon. The first is the general metabolic burden, which could be explained as the competition between biomass accumulation and recombinant protein production for metabolic materials such as cellular energy, ATP, and substrates, amino acids, [6]. This competition leads to stress responses including the stringent response and RNA polymerase subunit S-mediated stress responses, which could further decrease or even inhibit cell growth [7].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is considered as a first-choice heterologous host organism for the expression of recombinant protein. The advantages of E. coli as an organism for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known and rely on simplicity, fast growth, and cost-effective procedures of cell cultivation and protein extraction. Despite the availability of diverse E. coli strains, a variety of expression plasmids, and the number of approaches developed to produce different recombinant peptides and proteins [1,2], the application of such a heterologous host is still limited or not even possible for a broad range of peptides and proteins. The examples of difficult-to-obtain proteins include eukaryotic ones, whose synthesis requires codon optimization or post-translational modification, disulfide-bonded, toxic and integral membrane peptides and proteins. Moreover, screening for optimal strategy for the desired protein synthesis can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. \n\nSince it has been identified that protein synthesis is a ribosome-mediated process [3] that does not require the integrity of the cell [4], cell-free (CF) or in vitro protein synthesis is considered a good alternative for recombinant protein production. The productivity of cell-free expression systems has been greatly improved and in vitro methodology has been used for a variety of applications. The CF protein synthesis systems are generally constructed with cell extract prepared from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, or rabbit reticulocytes. The E. coli extract-based CF expression system is the most popular, and broad varieties of in vitro protein synthesis systems are commercialized by various companies (e.g., Biotechrabbit, Invitrogen, Qiagen, Promega), and have been used for a range of applications. \n\nThe CF protein synthesis system has several advantages over current in vivo processes. Firstly, since there is no need to support cellular metabolism; all of the cellular resources can be efficiently directed toward the production of a single protein [5].",

It defines the technology needed for the project, be it a variety of molecular tools, equipment, or reagents. Among microorganisms, host systems that are available include bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. All have strengths and weaknesses and their choice may be subject to the protein of interest (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Adrio and Demain, 2010). For example, if eukaryotic post-translational modifications (like protein glycosylation) are needed, a prokaryotic expression system may not be suitable (Sahdev et al., 2008). In this review, we will focus specifically on Escherichia coli. Other systems are described in excellent detail in accompanying articles of this series.\n\nThe advantages of using E. coli as the host organism are well known. (i) It has unparalleled fast growth kinetics. In glucose-salts media and given the optimal environmental conditions, its doubling time is about 20 min (Sezonov et al., 2007). This means that a culture inoculated with a 1/100 dilution of a saturated starter culture may reach stationary phase in a few hours. However, it should be noted that the expression of a recombinant protein may impart a metabolic burden on the microorganism, causing a considerable decrease in generation time (Bentley et al., 1990).\n\n(ii) High cell density cultures are easily achieved. The theoretical density limit of an E. coli liquid culture is estimated to be about 200 g dry cell weight/l or roughly 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/ml (Lee, 1996;Shiloach and Fass, 2005). However, exponential growth in www.frontiersin.org complex media leads to densities nowhere near that number. In the simplest laboratory setup (i.e., batch cultivation of E. coli at 37 \u2022 C, using LB media), <1 \u00d7 10 10 cells/ml may be the upper limit (Sezonov et al., 2007), which is less than 0.1% of the theoretical limit.

(1989) [132].\n\nThe first E. coli isolate was deposited in the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC, UK) in 1920.Later on, Cohen et al.

            "text": "The commercial production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes involves the utilization of various hosts, with the most common choices being bacteria, yeasts, and mammalian cell lines. However, identifying the most suitable host cell is arguably the most critical step in the entire production process. There are no universally ideal organisms capable of safely and efficiently producing all types of proteins. Therefore, the selection of an expression system must be carefully considered based on the characteristics of the final product. \n\nEscherichia coli is used for the recombinant production of at least 30% of the therapeutic proteins currently approved and has been-due to its well-known genetics, high rate of growth, and, in many cases, high yields-considered a favored platform in the biotech sector for its expression of proteins. For E. coli systems, there is a plethora of knowledge and extensive tools, such as vectors suitable for expression, selected strains, technologies endowed with fermentation, and strategies suitable for increasing protein folding, that are ideally developed in industrial applications. Recent advances in complex protein expression, such as full-length antibodies in non-glycosylated form, the engineering of new strains, N-glycosylation in bacterial organisms, and finally, cell-free systems, suggest that complex proteins and humanized glycoproteins can be produced in E. coli and that several strains and a lot of expression vectors have been engineered, such as the BL21(DE3)-pLysS for handling toxic proteins. E. coli can grow rapidly and produce high-density cultures using quite inexpensive culture media, allowing, in many cases, for high yields of the protein of interest. \n\nEukaryotic cells can be utilized as an alternative to prokaryotic cells for the expression in those cases requiring the strict control of the folding and assembly of multi-subunit proteins and the correct formation of disulfides since they have the required molecular, genetic, and metabolic characteristics. Because yeast cells are recognized as safe (GRAS) organisms, they are advantageous host organisms for the biopharmaceutical manufacturing of therapeutic recombinant proteins.",

Also, the bacteria-based expression system is the second most profitable after mammalian cells (Karyolaimos et al. 2019) Easy manipulation of the genome of unicellular hosts such as bacteria is their main advantage over multicellular organisms. In addition, unlike multicellular organisms, the transformation of bacteria is simple, highly efficient, and cost-effective (Baneyx 1999). In general, the cost of production, the complexity of the work path, the different patterns of post-translation modifications, the high protease property of hosts, the inability to secrete recombinant proteins, the contamination with pathogens and toxins, the solubility of recombinant proteins, and the unrelated codon preference can be a major bottleneck in the expression of recombinant proteins in various sorts of hosts (Bock 2015). To improve recombinant protein expression in the E. coli system we can apply some strategies such as using different promoters to regulate the over-expression of genes, utilizing different strains of E. coli, reducing the growth temperature, secretion of protein to extracellular space, changing the culture medium, using tags, and simultaneous expression of recombinant proteins with chaperones or foldases to help the correct folding of the proteins (Baeshen et al. 2015;Wang et al. 2007).",

Also their applications in biochemical and structural studies of the proteins and treatment purposes have increased. The first step in producing the recombinant proteins is the cloning of the desired gene into a suitable vector for expression of the protein. This is then followed by other steps such as purification, identification and structural and/or functional analysis (1) . In addition, solubility of the proteins may be considered as an important property (2) . However, high and rapid expressions of the proteins as well as the purification steps are major problems in the study of recombinant proteins (3) .\n\nEscherichia coli (E.coli) is a gram-negative bacterium that is used widely as a host for pro-karyotic expression of the recombinant proteins in both industrial and laboratory scales. There are several advantages for application of E.coli as a host for production of the recombinant proteins; E.coli was the first organism that its genome was recognized and sequenced. Therefore, several methods have been developed to improve the gene cloning and protein expression in the E.coli. In addition, E.coli grows rapidly at high density and it needs minimal and inexpensive substances for propagation (4) .\n\nApplication of fusion partner is a successful method for increasing the protein production (5,6) . Several fusion partners have been designed to facilitate the expression of the recombinant proteins. Previous studies showed the Mtb32C of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tuberculosis) when used as a fusion protein at the N terminal of recombinant proteins could increase their production and also their immune responses against the fused antigen compared to the antigen alone without Mtb32C tag (7) .\n\nThe aim of this study was cloning of Mtb32C into pET21b vector and evaluation of its ability to express the cloned fragment, Mtb32C, in order to construct a suitable vector which can be used for increasing the expression of desired recombinant proteins in future. In addition, the designed vector can be used for enhancing the immune responses against its fusion partners.",

            "text": "Bacteria are widely used in science and industry as cell factories for production of recombinant proteins. The choice of bacterial host and expression system relies heavily on the origin and properties of the heterologous protein. Today, the most commonly used bacterial hosts for expression of heterologous proteins are the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. E. coli is in many cases the most used host due to several advantages, including an extensively developed genetic tool box, well-known genetics and physiology, low-cost media, and rapid protein production in a short fermentation period [1]. However, this species also exhibits some limitations as the heterologous proteins are typically expressed intracellularly, which results in problems with formation of inclusion bodies and incorrect protein folding. B. subtilis, on the other hand, has become an industrial workhorse for recombinant protein production due to an easy cultivation, the products of its metabolism being generally recognized as safe (GRAS), ease of genetic manipulation, well-characterized expression systems, absence of significant codon bias, and exceptional ability to secrete heterologous proteins allowing cost-effective downstream processing. Lacking an outer membrane, B. subtilis can efficiently secrete recombinant proteins to the culture medium, therefore this bacterium is more suitable for the production of secretory recombinant proteins than E. coli [2,3]. Challenges in recombinant protein production in B. subtilis have typically been related to the activity of cell-wall-associated proteases interfering with folding of heterologous proteins in the interface between cell wall and extracellular space. This has later been ameliorated with the use of genome editing to remove the genes coding for interfering proteases [4][5][6]. Further work on B. subtilis to improve its properties as a host for heterologous protein production has been done, including Morimoto et al. (2008) demonstrating that a 20% reduction of genome size resulted in a proportionate increase in recombinant protein yields at the cost of lowered growth rates [7].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli was the first host to be used for recombinant gene expression almost 40 years ago [1]. Within the past 15 years, Pichia pastoris has successfully entered the scene and is now the second most-used host for recombinant gene expression. Based on searches of the PubMed citation database, the use of P. pastoris as an expression host has increased from 4% to 17% of the total recombinant genes reported on from 1995 to 2009 (Fig. 1). Within the same time period, the usage of E. coli as an expression host remained constant, with approximately 60% of the recombinant genes reported on in journals indexed in PubMed being expressed in E. coli. Similar trends prevailed when analyzing publications in the journal Microbial Cell Factories during the period from 2005 to 2009 (Fig. 1). Several other expression systems are widely used, but to a lesser extent than E. coli and P. pastoris. So, why are E. coli and P. pastoris particularly suited for recombinant gene expression? Protein produced from a recombinant gene in E. coli as a soluble and functional product with high yield is the ideal situation for most research and industrial protein production purposes [2][3][4]. However, this situation is far from realistic for all recombinant gene products. In particular, proteins derived from eukaryotes are prone to inclusion body formation and low yields. This outcome can be explained by the fact that the rate of gene translation in E. coli is 4-to 10-fold higher than in eukaryotes [5]. Correct formation of disulfide bonds, protein folding, and protein function must be carefully assessed both when the proteins have been recombinantly produced in E. coli in a soluble form, when they have been refolded in vitro, or obtained from any other source [6]. Further, E. coli should not be used as the expression system if posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are of importance for the study or purpose of the protein because these microbes are unable to incorporate PTMs, including Nlinked glycan chains.",

            "text": "The choice of an expression system for the high-level production of recombinant proteins depends on many factors. These include cell growth characteristics, expression levels, intracellular and extracellular expression, posttranslational modifications, and biological activity of the protein of interest, as well as regulatory issues in the production of therapeutic proteins (191,254). In addition, the selection of a particular expression system requires a cost breakdown in terms of process, design, and other economic considerations. The relative merits of bacterial, yeast, insect, and mammalian expression systems have been examined in detail in an excellent review by Marino (362). In addition, Datar et al. (121) have analyzed the economic issues associated with protein production in bacterial and mammalian cells. \n\nThe many advantages of Escherichia coli have ensured that it remains a valuable organism for the high-level production of recombinant proteins (177a, 197, 254, 362, 406, 426, 510). However, in spite of the extensive knowledge on the genetics and molecular biology of E. coli, not every gene can be expressed efficiently in this organism. This may be due to the unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and translational efficiency of mRNA, the ease of protein folding, degradation of the protein by host cell proteases, major differences in codon usage between the foreign gene and native E. coli, and the potential toxicity of the protein to the host. Fortunately, some empirical \"rules\" that can guide the design of expression systems and limit the unpredictability of this operation in E. coli have emerged. The major drawbacks of E. coli as an expression system include the inability to perform many of the posttranslational modifications found in eukaryotic proteins, the lack of a secretion mechanism for the efficient release of protein into the culture medium, and the limited ability to facilitate extensive disulfide bond formation. On the other hand, many eukaryotic proteins retain their full biological activity in a nonglycosylated form and therefore can be produced in E. coli (see, e.g., references 170, 342, and 486).",

            "text": "E. coli is a preferred expression system for production of heterologous proteins due to its well-characterized genetics, ease of genetic manipulation, availability of several plasmid vectors and engineered host strains, low manufacturing cost, high yield of recombinant proteins as compared to other expression systems including yeast, mammalian cell lines, transgenic plants and transgenic animals. However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

            "text": "With the advent of genetic engineering technologies, many proteins have been experimentally expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) with high efficiency. Because of its short life cycle, easy genetic manipulation, and simple culture conditions, E. coli is a preferable host to produce many recombinant proteins [5,6]. E. coli was the first host utilized by Eli Lilly in 1982 to produce recombinant insulin [7]. Although all bacteria could be used for recombinant protein technologies, E. coli is still the preferable host for the industrial production of recombinant proteins [8]. For cloning purposes in E. coli species, researchers are faced with two main obstacles: solubility of recombinant proteins for high expression and low and complicated expression of a foreign gene. Accordingly, the E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus strain is a good host for large-scale protein expression. The expression of a foreign protein in E. coli is influenced by a range of factors, and there is no standard strategy to overcome these issues. \n\nOverall, five variabilities affect the solubility and expression of proteins in the cloning process, which might help to proper folding of desired protein and increase the expression level: 1-using proper host, 2-proper vector, 3-co-expression with other genes, 4-changing the gene sequences, and 5-variations of culture parameters of the recombinant host strains [9]. Using an appropriate expression host and vector significantly increase the activity and solubility of target proteins. A suitable vector can enhance expression, folding, and solubility in different ways. The folding can be improved in hosts that allow the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm when using vectors designed for cytoplasmic expression [10][11][12][13]. The pET-21b(+) vector has a T7 RNA promoter and 6 His-tag DNA sequence, which facilitates the purification and detection of protein or may increase the probability of biological activities by affecting solubility in the cytoplasm or exportation to the periplasmic area.",

Three expression systems were successful enough to serve as a basis for large-scale manufacturing. The resulting CRM197 proteins are distributed as PeliCRM\u2122 (Ligand Pharmaceuticals, previously sold by Pfenex, expression in P. fluorescens) [23], EcoCRM\u2122 (Fina BioSolutions LLC, expression in E. coli) [19], and simply CRM197 (Scarab Genomics LLC, expression in Clean Genome \u00ae E. coli) [20]. None of these expression protocols has been reported in peer-reviewed articles. The recombinant variants of CRM197 expressed in E. coli and P. fluorescens were shown to be highly similar to those expressed in C. diphtheriae and sometimes even more pure [27]. \n\nE. coli is undoubtedly the most popular host microorganism for the expression of heterologous proteins, both in academic research and in biotechnology. Its well-known advantages are the following: (1) E. coli is able to grow fast and form high-cell-density cultures on relatively inexpensive growth media; (2) the E. coli genome is completely sequenced, and its genetics and metabolism are well studied; (3) a variety of E. coli strains and suitable expression vectors have been developed; and (4) the construction of new E. coli strains is also not complicated.

Accordingly, the three approved recombinant vaccines for human use that employ bacteria as the expression system are produced in E. coli. These vaccines are Hecolin (Xiamen Innovax Biotech, approved in 2012 in China), Bexsero (Novartis, commercialized since 2013) and Cecolin (Xiamen Innovan Biotech, approved in 2019), which offer protection against Hepatitis E, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B and human papillomavirus 16 and 18, respectively (see Table 1). Outside of human application, there are other approved recombinant vaccines produced in E. coli prescribed to protect against canine, feline and equine pathogens, such as Borrelia burgdoferi (Vanguard crLyme, Recombitek Lyme), Leishmania (Letifend), Feline leukemia virus (Leucogen & Nobivac LeuFel) and Streptococcus equi (Strangvac) (see Table 1). \n\nAlthough E. coli remains as the main expression system for recombinant production in bacteria, there are many other bacterial species being adapted in parallel that offer unique traits and advantages as protein producers. Among Gram negative bacteria, Pseudomonas fluorescens has been of particular interest for its nonacetogenic nature and moderate oxygen needs, enabling a lax control over oxygen and glucose concentrations while still achieving good production yields [90]. In fact, there is a wide toolbox and strains available for recombinant protein production that feature antibiotic-free selection or periplasmic protein expression [90][91][92]. To this date, two recombinant proteins produced in P. fluorescens have already been successful in eliciting protection against malaria and anthrax infections in mouse and rabbit models, respectively [93,94].",

E. coli expression systems been used for recombinant proteins production both intracellularly and extracellularly. In spite of the many advantages of using E. coli as expression host, there are certain limitations such as upon gene over expression, recombinant protein aggregates to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. In order  to reduce the inclusion bodies, several strategies could be used such as regulation of the protein synthesis rate, co-expression of chaperone genes and empowering the secretion of proteins into the periplasm. However, the control rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by altering the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium [9].\n\nAlthough previously it has been reported that the expression of the xylanase genes usually cannot be functionally expressed in E. coli due to some factors including the repetitive appearance of rare codons and the requirement for specific post translational modifications such as disulfide bond formation and glycosylation [51] and also it require N-glycosylation whereas E. coli can only perform simple O-glycosylation [52]. However, recently recombinant xylanase of family GH10 (XYN) from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum (DSM 571) was successfully overexpressed in E. coli (strain BL21) [53].

            "text": "The use of recombinant proteins has increased with the advent of various expression hosts that facilitate their soluble, biologically active, and large-scale production. Although mammalian expression systems possess many advantages (Wurm 2004), the bacterial expression system is considered the most efficient host compared to other organisms for the production of protein-based pharmaceuticals because of its various attributes, including high expression yield, cost-effectiveness, rapid protein expression, and proficient scale-up. E. coli is considered the most promising bacterial strain for recombinant protein production; however, it lacks machinery for posttranslational modifications that can lead to inefficient protein folding and aggregation (in the form of inclusion bodies) (Stewart et al. 1998; Bessette et al. 1999). Aggregation can affect the biological activity and stability of therapeutic proteins and is considered a risk factor for increased immunogenicity. The major challenges in the production of therapeutic proteins from inclusion bodies are isolation, washing, solubilization, and refolding procedures (Clark 2001;Middelberg 2002). Much effort is required for the development of a robust procedure for producing industrial-grade proteins that are stable, properly folded, and free from aggregation. \n\nThe co-expression of target proteins with soluble fusion partners for heterologous protein production in E. coli can lead to enhanced expression and efficient purification. Exploiting its chaperoning properties, the SUMO tag allows high-level expression through proper folding of the target protein (Malakhov et al. 2004;Butt et al. 2005). A high soluble protein expression level can be attained using this fusion system, yielding approximately 30% of the total soluble protein fraction in E. coli (Wang et al. 2010). The SUMO protease recognizes the SUMO fusion partner, facilitating precise proteolytic cleavage, thus resulting in the production of native proteins. pET SUMO has been widely used to produce many therapeutically important proteins, including human interferon alpha-2a (Bis et al. 2014), BMP-14 (Li et al. 2011), human interleukin-11 (Nguyen et al. 2018), andFGF-21 (Wang et al. 2010).",

            "text": "The methylotrophic yeast, P. pastoris, is a useful system for the production of genetically engineered enzymes (through heterologous gene expression) for both research and industrial purposes [18]. It is considered non-toxigenic and non-pathogenic, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, White Oak, MD, USA) has approved several products prepared with help of this organism, and these products are generally accepted as safe substances (GRAS). In addition, it is an excellent host for the synthesis of recombinant proteins and offers additional benefits ranging from rapid growth to high cell density in an inexpensive and non-complex culture medium and facilitates the purification of recombinant proteins expressed heterologically [19][20][21]. \n\nE. coli expression systems are often used to produce exogenous protein on laboratory and industrial scales owing to the low cost, speed, and simplicity of cultivation [22]. E. coli strains DH5\u03b1 and Rosetta (DE3) have been used for the cloning of genes and the expression of proteins. E. coli is one of the earliest and most commonly used hosts for heterologous protein production [23,24]. The advantages and disadvantages are presented in Table 1. The advantages include rapid growth, fast expression, ease of cultivation, and high product yields [25][26][27]. It is used to manufacture large quantities of commercialized proteins. This method is particularly outstanding for the functional expression of non-glycosylated proteins. E. coli genetics are better understood than that of any other microorganism [28]. Recent advances in the understanding of the processes involved in coding, translation, and protein folding in E. coli and the use of advanced genetic instruments render this bacterium more useful than ever for the production of diverse eukaryotic proteins [29][30][31][32]. Its genome can be updated rapidly and reliably with ease. The regulation of promoter elements is not complex, and the number of plasmid copies can be easily adjusted. This method often adjusts the metabolic carbon supply, prevents the absorption of amino acid analogs, establishes intracellular disulfide bonds [33], and demonstrates a reproducible performance with computer control.",

Researchers now select from among mammalian, insect, yeast, and prokaryotic hosts, and the number of vectors available for use in these organisms continues to grow. With the increased availability of cDNAs and protein coding sequencing information, it is certain that these and other, yet to be developed systems will be important in the future. Despite the development of eukaryotic systems, E. coli remains the most widely used host for recombinant protein expression. Optimization of recombinant protein expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host systems has been carried out by varying simple parameters such as expression vectors, host strains, media composition, and growth temperature. Recombinant gene expression in eukaryotic systems is often the only viable route to the large-scale production of authentic, post translationally modified proteins. It is becoming increasingly easy to find a suitable system to overexpress virtually any gene product, provided that it is properly engineered into an appropriate expression vector.",

            "text": "Proteins are essential components of life and constitute the majority of living organisms. They play crucial roles in a number of cell processes, including cell signalling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and cell cycle, and therefore their de ciency is associated with several disorders. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the late1970s, proteins began to be produced in many host organisms, resulting in quicker and simpler processes relative to their natural sources [1]. With the advancements in biological therapeutics, the development of recombinant protein drugs on a wide scale is becoming increasingly essential. The optimizations of conditions for the expression of recombinant proteins have been carried out in a variety of expression systems like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, insect cells, and mammalian cells [2][3][4]. Among these expression systems, the prokaryotic expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins are much preferred. E. coli was the rst host in which recombinant DNA (rDNA) protein, insulin, was produced [5]. E. coli remains the dominant host for the production of recombinant proteins because it is inexpensive and cost-effective for mass production of recombinant proteins. E. coli has a fast growth rate with early protein expression and high protein yield, which makes it preferable over other expression systems. Because of the better understanding of E. coli mode of transcription and translation, it is easier to manipulate its genome to optimize protein expression. \n\nA large number of commercially important proteins are recombinantly produced in E. coli, including T4 DNA ligase, CD4 and viral antigens for vaccines [6][7][8]. The expression of proteins in E. coli is achieved by inserting the gene for the recombinant protein in an expression vector under the control of a constitutive or regulatable promotor. Constitutive promoters are used for the overproduction of recombinant protein by continuous production, but they impart metabolic stress on cells energy resources leading to growth inhibition and ultimately lower yield of recombinant protein [9].",

            "text": "ecombinant pharmaceutical proteins such as antibody fragments offer many advantages over traditional drugs. There are several platforms for production of target recombinant proteins, including bacterial, yeasts, and mammalian expression systems [1,2] . Although the selection of the expression host is dependent on the nature of the target protein, the E. coli expression system is the preferred host for screening and even initial development of commercial recombinant products [3,4] . The advantages of using E. coli as a bacterial expression system include the rapid growth rate to high cell density, inexpensive production substrate, and easy genetic manipulation and transformation [4,5] . The efficiency of the recombinant protein expression in this host is related to the genetic characteristics of the E. coli strain, expression vectors and the target heterologous protein.\n\nIn addition, manipulation of the expression process to optimize protein production is essential to enhance the yield of the protein [6] . The classical method for optimization of a protein expression is to change one factor at a time while keeping other factors constant. This method is often ineffective because changing one factor at a time does not represent the combined effect of the involved variables. In addition, it is a timeconsuming process and needs a large number of experiments [6,7] . To overcome this problem, the best approach is to use the statistical design of experiments, which allows simultaneous evaluation of many more variables at lower cost with a few experimental trials [6][7][8] . In view of this consideration, the goal of this work was to improve the expression of a previously described fusion protein, anti-CD22 scFv-apoptin, in E. coli [9] , using experimental design.",

The Escherichia coli is still the dominant host for recombinant protein production but, as a bacterial cell, it also has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of the E. coli expression system. Conversely, E. coli benefits of cost, ease of use and scale make it essential to design new approaches directed for improved recombinant protein production in this host cell. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering novel tailored-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements. Gene fusion technology has been widely used for the improvement of soluble protein production and/or purification in E. coli, and for increasing peptide\u2019s immunogenicity as well. New fusion partners are constantly emerging and complementing the traditional solutions, as for instance, the Fh8 fusion tag that has been recently studied and ranked among the best solubility enhancer partners. In this review, we provide an overview of current strategies to improve recombinant protein production in E. coli, including the key factors for successful protein production, highlighting soluble protein production, and a comprehensive summary of the latest available and traditionally used gene fusion technologies. A special emphasis is given to the recently discovered Fh8 fusion system that can be used for soluble protein production, purification, and immunogenicity in E. coli. The number of existing fusion tags will probably increase in the next few years, and efforts should be taken to better understand how fusion tags act in E. coli. This knowledge will undoubtedly drive the development of new tailored-made tools for protein production in this bacterial system.",

The current source of HSA is human blood plasma which is a limited and unsafe source. Thus, there\u00a0exists an indispensable need to promote non-animal derived recombinant HSA (rHSA) production. Escherichia coli is one of the most convenient hosts which had contributed to the production of more than 30% of the FDA approved recombinant pharmaceuticals. It grows rapidly and reaches high cell density using inexpensive and simple subst-rates. E. coli derived recombinant products have more economic potential as fermentation processes are cheaper compared to the other expression hosts. The major bottleneck in exploiting E. coli as a host for a disulfide-rich multidomain protein is the formation of aggregates of overexpressed protein. The majority of the expressed HSA forms inclusion bodies (more than 90% of the total expressed rHSA) in the E. coli cytosol. Recovery of functional rHSA from inclusion bodies is not preferred because it is difficult to obtain a large multidomain disulfide bond rich protein like rHSA in its functional native form. Purification is tedious, time-consuming, laborious and expensive. Because of such limitations, the E. coli host system was neglected for rHSA production for the past few decades despite its numerous advantages.ResultsIn the present work, we have exploited the capabilities of E. coli as a host for the enhanced functional production of rHSA (~\u00a060% of the total expressed rHSA in the soluble fraction). Parameters like intracellular environment, temperature, induction type, duration of induction, cell lysis conditions etc. which play an important role in enhancing the level of production of the desired protein in its native form in vivo have been optimized. We have studied the effect of assistance of different types of exogenously employed chaperone systems on the functional expression of rHSA in the E. coli host system. Different aspects of cell growth parameters during the production of rHSA in presence and absence of molecular chaperones in E. coli have also been studied.ConclusionIn the present case, we",

            "text": "E.coli has rapid growth rate, ease of high cell density fermentation, affordability and the availability of excellent genetic tools, due to these characteristics of E.coli it have been extensively used for protein over expression [1]. E. coli is comprehensively used in laboratories which resulted in technologies to target protein over expression to different intracellular compartments (Fig. 1).This is beneficial because these compartments have various environments which might enable folding of particular proteins of interest [2]. The optimization of recombinant protein expression in E.coli was carried out widely by trial and error by altering the simple parameters like expression vectors, host strains, media composition, and growth temperature [3]. During the past years, pervasive studies have shown that replacing codons with a heterologous gene with synonymous ones used superiorly on the expression of host (codon optimization), and manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the translational initiation region could have a profound effect on recombinant protein yields [4]. In order to perform molecular epigenetic techniques successfully, it is important to have a full understanding of the properties and of the various Escherichia coli host strains that are commonly used for the propagation and manipulation of recombinant DNA [5]. E.coli is an enteric rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium with a circular genome of 4.6Mb [6]. It was initially chosen as a model system because of its ability to grow on chemically defined media and its rapid growth rate. In rich media, during the log phase of its growth, E.coli doubles every 20-30min; hence, with overnight incubation period, single selected organisms will double enough times to yield a colony on an agar plate 0r 1-2 billion cells per millilitre of the liquid media. The ease of its transformability and genetic manipulation has subsequently solidified the role of E.coli as the host of choice for the propagation, manipulation, and characterization of recombinant DNA [7]. In the past 60 years, intensive research was performed on E.coli, as a result, now a lot more is known about these bacilli than any other organisms on earth. A diverse variety of E.coli mutants were isolated and characterized.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a preferred expression host due to its well-known biochemistry and genetics, as well as simple and straightforward genetic manipulations. Some disadvantages of this prokaryotic expression system include a lack of posttranslational modifications of recombinant proteins (i.e., glycosylation, formation of disulfide bonds, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing), formation of insoluble inclusion bodies, poor secretion, codon bias, and endotoxin issues. Thus, the E. coli expression system is constantly being improved to overcome these problems [1,3,16]. Recombinant proteins have also been produced in other bacterial cell factories, e.g., Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Streptomyces spp., allowing the efficient secretion of recombinant proteins or lactic acid bacteria with the Generally Recognized as Safe status by FDA, such as Lactobacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis [1,4,17]. \n\nEukaryotic cells possess an endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which play a substantial role in posttranslational modifications and transport of proteins, and thus are widely used in the production of recombinant protein-based biopharmaceuticals. Among all first-time approved biopharmaceuticals from 2015 to July 2018, over half (53%) were monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and, consequently, mammalian cells dominated the other eukaryotic expression systems [18]. Mammalian cells, including the most commonly used Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), have the ability to produce large and complex proteins with appropriate posttranslational modifications, especially glycosylation, with mediumto-high yields. However, the mammalian cell factories have some limitations, namely, the introduction of heterologous gene and selection of the clone being time-consuming, the risk of infection by viruses being high, the scale-up capacity being low, the propagation being difficult, the production time being long, and the ultimate overall costs being high [1,3].",

            "text": "With the development of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s, the expression and production of recombinant proteins in various host organisms became feasible, easier, and more cost-effective than proteins derived from natural sources. Escherichia coli has been a widely used bacterium for the expression of recombinant proteins, mainly due to its multiple advantages such as fast growth, high yield, low production costs, easy genetic manipulation, and availability of multiple molecular tools [1][2][3]. Other hosts are also employed for technical reasons or to improve the quality of the expressed proteins. For example, prokaryotic organisms do not perform complex post-translational modifications compared to eukaryotic organisms. In addition, some toxic components of bacteria may be of concern, mainly when a given protein is intended for therapeutic use. In contrast, some yeasts are known to have a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making them well-suited for recombinant protein production [1,[4][5][6]. To make human-like proteins, yeast cells have been engineered to attach glycosylated side chains into recombinant proteins [7]. Moreover, mammalian cells are the preferred hosts for expressing highquality eukaryotic proteins, that is, proteins similar or identical to those of the original host [3,7]. \n\nRecombinant proteins are sometimes difficult to produce in their functional form using established expression systems. Thus, it is often necessary to optimize their production in the host system, e.g., to minimize the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli. Several other strategies have been developed. Besides, protein expression at low temperatures has been reported to significantly influence product quality [1,2,8]. Nonetheless, the use of low expression temperatures decreases both, cell growth and target protein yield. These drawbacks can be circumvented with the use of cold-inducible promoters to induce recombinant protein production at low temperatures [1,9,10]. \n\nThe heat shock response has been well documented in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Also, the coldshock response has been studied in different organisms [11,12].",

The production of recombinant proteins has been implemented in many different prokaryotic and eukaryotic host systems, including E. coli, yeast, filamentous fungi, insect cells, Arabidopsis, and even in mammalian cell culture lines (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). Among these systems, E. coli is often preferred due to its fast growth, high cell density cultures, rich complex media, and easy transformation (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). In order to improve the heterologous protein expression of E. coli systems, a number of protein tags have been developed, including the maltose-binding protein (MBP; Kapust and Waugh, 1999), glutathione S-transferase (GST; Smith and Johnson, 1988), small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO; Marblestone et al., 2006), N-utilization substance protein A (NusA; Davis et al., 1999), thioredoxin (Trx;LaVallie et al., 1993), and ubiquitin (Bachmair et al., 1986;Varshavsky, 2005).",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production (RPP) is an industrially important tool for the production of hundreds of licensed recombinant proteins (RPs), including IgG antibodies and antibody fragments (Walsh 2014;Sanchez-Garcia et al. 2016). Unlike their larger full-length IgG monoclonal antibody counterparts, which are commonly produced in mammalian cells, the relative simplicity of antibody fragments and their requirement for fewer post-translational modifications makes them suitable for production in bacterial hosts. The bacterium Escherichia coli is a commonly employed host for recombinant protein production (RPP) contributing to the production of one-third of FDA approved human biotherapeutics (Overton 2014;Walsh 2014). Single chain variable fragments (scFv) are an emerging class of IgG fragments comprising the antigen-binding variable heavy (V H ) and variable light (V L ) domains fused into a single polypeptide chain with a flexible linker (Nelson 2010). \n\nThe suitability of E. coli as a host for production of recombinant antibody fragments and other human biotherapeutic proteins stems, in large part from the following: (i) its physiology, metabolism and behaviour are very well understood compared to other bacterial species; (ii) it exhibits much faster growth, attains higher cell densities and also requires much cheaper growth media than mammalian hosts; and (iii) although it cannot produce RPs with 'human-like' glycosylation, it can generate disulphide bonds (Pl\u00fcckthun and Skerra 1989;Hsu et al. 2016). \n\nUnlike the cytoplasm, which is a reducing environment, the periplasm is an oxidising environment and so favours the formation of disulphide bonds (de Marco 2009); it also contains enzymes which catalyse the formation, correction and maintenance of disulphide bonds (the Dsb enzymes (Inaba 2009). The periplasm of E. coli offers additional advantages as a cellular compartment for targeting RPs in bioprocesses.",

            "text": "The E. coli expression system has some convenient features, such as high growth rate, high achievable cell density in culture, grows on simple culture media, and high level of recombinant protein expression. In addition, different expression platforms and engineered strains are available for special purposes, for example, for fast and easy genetic transformation. E. coli has doubling time of 20 min in Luria-Bertani broth and can reach maximum cell density of up to 200 g (DCW)/L, or near to 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/mL [6,25,31,32]. Unlike E. coli, Bacillus subtilis has a GRAS status and is able to express extracellular proteins, consequently it is the most studied Grampositive bacterium. Other advantages of this expression system are its well-characterized genetics, its short fermentation time, and ability to grow in low-cost culture media, making it ideal for industrial and pharmaceutical applications. However, the often-low efficiency of genetic transformation and the lack of molecular biology tools have limited the application of the protein expression systems based on Bacillus [33,34]. Although bacterial systems offer many advantages, not all proteins can be suitably or readily expressed with them. Overall, they suffer from plasmid instability, and are markedly deficient when complex post-translational modifications are needed. Besides, some proteins can form inclusion bodies, which may require additional processing steps for refolding. As a result, this may substantially increase costs or undesirably affect yield. Furthermore, the possible accumulation of endotoxins, pyrogenic to humans or animals, is another disturbing drawback when therapeutic proteins are produced in E. coli [1,6,29]. Thereby, a continued search is required to find other suitable expression systems to increase either the quality, quantity, or stability of recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "The recent completion of sequencing of the genome of Plasmodium falciparum has stimulated studies on new proteins and biochemical systems that need further experimental validation. This influx of potentially useful vaccine and drug candidates against malaria has added to the backlog of targets currently under validation. The bottleneck, imposed by the need to have soluble proteins for functional studies, has been considerably narrowed by the unpredictability associated with recombinant expression in host systems. Protein transition, from a naturally occurring low concentration in vivo, to unnaturally higher concentrations in expression hosts often results in poor solubility, aggregation and inclusion body formation [1]. The success of most, if not all functional and structural studies, is contingent on the abundant availability of soluble proteins.\n\nHeterologous expression of malarial proteins is performed primarily in Escherichia coli, although yeast and insect cells are becoming increasingly popular, particularly for proteins that are predicted to undergo post-translational processing. In general, E. coli, as an expression host has advantages in terms of procedural simplicity, well known E. coli genetics, availability of compatible molecular tools, higher yields per unit biomass and thereby low costs sustained. The fact that over expression in E. coli is often associated with accumulation of recombinant protein as insoluble aggregates has not precluded its usage as the expression system of primary choice. A wide arsenal of innovative strategies has been employed to increase the yield of soluble protein(s). These include simultaneous over expression of molecular chaperones, remedying codon bias with supplementation of rare tRNAs, mRNA stabilisation strategies, use of strong promoters with tight control of background expression in protease defecient E. coli strains and optimization of culture media against limiting factors and products [2]. These strategies although useful, however, cannot be harnessed in a high throughput manner. Malarial genes exhibit an A+T composition approaching 80% and show frequent occurrence of long clusters of rare E. coli codons. Consequently, premature translational termination, frameshift events and mistranslational amino acid substitutions arising from codon bias further complicate recombinant expression of malarial proteins in E. coli. Recombinant expression of malarial genes in E. coli is thus confined to trial and error.\n\nIn",

Owing to its fast proliferation, high expression levels and short fermentation time, Escherichia coli is the host bacterium most commonly used for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins [1]. However, E. coli is not always suitable for the production of active proteins on account of problems of insolubility, cytotoxicity, inefficient translation or the inability to carry out post-translational modifications [2]. In order to overcome these problems, other prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts have been used. Bacillus spp and Lactococcus are Gram-positive bacteria that are often used to secrete proteins into the culture medium [3][4][5][6][7][8]. Eukaryotic cells, such as yeast cells, insect cells or immortalized cell lines, are mainly used to produce active proteins with posttranslational modifications [9,10].\n\nStreptomyces is a promising bacterial expression system that has been used to produce high levels of several proteins [1,11]. Streptomycetes are aerobic, filamentous Gram-positive soil bacteria that secrete a wide range of extracellular enzymes to degrade a broad variety of substrates in order to survive.\n\nAs a host, Streptomyces has the following advantages over other systems: 1) the formation of inclusion bodies has not been described in the literature; 2) it is a wellsuited host for the expression of very GC-rich genes without codon adaptation [12]; 3) it has high protein secretion efficiency, which makes it feasible to obtain the protein of interest in the culture supernatant, facilitating the protein folding and downstream procedures of extraction and purification [11]; 4) the species used to express proteins (see below) display a relatively low level of endogenous extracellular proteolytic activity in comparison with other hosts such as Bacillus, where deletion of up to seven extracellular proteases had to be done to",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is the most widely studied and frequently used host for recombinant protein production because its genetics are well-characterized, the culture periods are short, and protein production levels are high [1][2][3]. Because E. coli has both inner and outer membranes, recombinant proteins produced in this host can localize to the cytoplasm, the periplasm, or the culture medium [2,4]. Production of recombinant proteins in the culture medium is the most desirable of these alternatives, whether the protein is produced on an analytical or industrial scale, because the protein being produced experiences superior protein folding, requires a simpler extraction procedure, and is contaminated with fewer proteins [1,5]. Unfortunately, E. coli is a relatively poor secretor of proteins, which is a significant barrier to the application to this methodology [6]. \n\nMany attempts have been made to enhance the extracellular production of recombinant secretory proteins in E. coli, and some success has been achieved [2,6]. Two different approaches have been pursued. In one approach, protein secretion was enhanced through co-expression or modification of transport proteins [7][8][9][10]. The validity and universality of this approach may be compromised by the complexity and regulatory mechanisms associated with protein secretion systems. The other approach was to enhance nonspecific leakage of the recombinant proteins through the host cell membranes by constructing hosts with a leaky phenotype. Induction of the leaky phenotype can be accomplished through mutation or deletion of membrane components, addition of permeability enhancers (glycine, calcium, Triton X-100, etc.), or co-expression of proteins with lytic activity (bacterial phage lysis proteins) [2,[11][12][13][14]. Because the cell membrane is compromised to some extent, this approach has the inherent risks of impaired cell growth and cell lysis. Cytosolic proteins are generally expressed in the cytoplasm and extracted, after cell disruption, using physical, chemical, or biological methods. These processes result in contamination of the recombinant protein by various cellular components.",

            "text": "The least expensive, simplest, and fastest protein expression can be achieved in Escherichia coli. Nonetheless, large proteins are difficult to be synthesized with this bacterium. Moreover, E. coli is not the best system for S-S-rich proteins that require post-translational modifications. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are the most frequently used yeast species for the production of such proteins. At a low cost, yeast systems typically generate high protein yields as well as proteins with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa, along with the extraction of signal sequences and stimulation of glycosylation. The baculovirus system can incorporate more complex post-translational protein modifications. Most commonly, mammalian cells are used for the production of recombinant mammalian glycosylated proteins. Genetically engineered animals secrete recombinant proteins in their milk, blood, or urine. Similarly, several recombinant proteins can be produced from transgenic plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. \n\nThe effectiveness of expressing a recombinant protein in E. coli primarily relies on the ability to prevent unfavorable interactions between newly expressed polypeptides. These interactions lead to the aggregation of intermediate folding substances instead of native protein production [6][7][8]11]. System efficiency can be improved by maintaining conditions that stabilize intermediate folding and promote mature structure formation. Various strategies can help prevent the aggregation of proteins by masking the hydrophobic patches on their external surfaces [12,13]. Such strategies involve the introduction of chaperone molecules, incorporation of detergents, or co-expression of interacting sub-units involved in large complexes. When the conditions are designed to maintain the mono-dispersion of the folding intermediates, speeding up the folding cycle becomes essential for the production of stable native structures and prevention of the accumulation of metastable configurations that are potentially vulnerable to aggregation [14]. Foldases and isomerases may improve the folding process considerably. In this review, we focus on the solutions that are available for improving the bacterial expression of proteins that rely on the formation of disulfide bonds in their native state.",

In 1973, Cohen and Boyer reported their success in creating the first Escherichia coli transformant into which a recombinant plasmid molecule was introduced [2].\n\nThe possibility of inserting foreign DNA into E. coli has not only allowed the development of a vast number of molecular biology techniques for genetic manipulations, e.g., construction and characterization of cDNA libraries, DNA splicing and amplification, hybridization and sequencing, site-specific mutagenesis, research and applications of bacteriophages and DNA modifying enzymes, studies of regulation of gene expression, etc., but also the exploitation of E. coli for use as a surrogate host for the expression of heterologous proteins. Despite the presence of restriction process for the recombinant production of medically valuable proteins that are preferred to share the authentic structures with their native counterparts.\n\nProteins expressed in eukaryotic cells are subjected to post-translational modifications (PTM), of which many of them do not appear to occur in E. coli cells. Despite this deficiency, E. coli is still the most common choice employed for the expression of eukaryotic proteins. For example, about 30% of the medically valuable proteins produced using recombinant DNA approaches are expressed employing E. coli as the host [8]. The finding of successful expression of eukaryotic proteins in E. coli suggests that many target proteins may not be posttranslationally modified, and even some of them are, PTM may not have a direct effect on functional activities. The observation also supports the view that E. coli will continuously play an indispensable role in heterologous protein expression. In choosing the most appropriate tactic for the expression of a heterologous protein in E. coli, it is important that we understand both the target protein and the available methods of choice well. E. coli is recognized as being a \"",

            "text": "Plasmids are important vectors for the transfer of genetic material among microbes. The transfer of plasmids causes transmission of genes involved in pathogenesis and survival, to the host bacteria leading to their evolution and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. A large number of plasmids of varying sizes have been discovered and isolated from various microorganisms. Plasmids are also valuable tools to genetically manipulate microbes for various purposes including production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most preferred microbe for production of recombinant proteins, due to rapid growth rate, cost-effectiveness, high yield of the recombinant proteins and easy scale-up process. Several plasmids have been designed to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. In order to circumvent the issues of protein refolding, the codon usage in E. coli , the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and low recovery of functionally active recombinant proteins, various plasmids have been designed and constructed. This chapter summarizes the recent technological advancements that have extended the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex proteins, including glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. production of complex glycosylated biopharmaceuticals. Wacker and colleagues discovered a novel N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated the successful transfer of glycosylation pathway in E. coli to generate a strain with capability to produce recombinant glycosylated proteins [ 45 ]. These various technological advancements have demonstrated that E. coli can be engineered specifically for each heterologous protein to obtain high yield of biologically active products.",

            "text": "The conventional approach: expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) Escherichia coli still remains the most popular organism for recombinant protein expression and it still represents the standard for the production of antibody fragments on a lab scale. There are objective advantages for this choice, such as its simplicity, the availability of a large amount of well-tested reagents (vectors, strains), and the enormous experience (protocols, common expertise) that the research community accumulated over the last 30 years using this specific bacterium. The negative side effects implicit in choosing E. coli-based expression systems are that this solution is often driven by consuetude rather than by rational considerations. This means that both innovative approaches that exploit E. coli and systems based on other organisms might be neglected despite their use do not always requires further competences or particular equipment. In the case of antibody fragments, the conventional approach is to express them as secreted constructs that accumulate in the E. coli periplasm because this is the sole bacterial compartment that provides the oxidizing conditions and the combination of specific chaperone and isomerase activities necessary for the formation of correct and stabilizing disulfide bonds (Fig. 1). This approach enables the production of large amounts of functional antibody fragments and also their fusions to large proteins such as alkaline phosphatase and rhizavidin [4,5]. However, in some cases the yields can be very low due to impaired secretion in the presence of too elevated expression levels and because of limiting chaperone availability in the periplasm [6][7][8]. Oxidizing conditions can be reproduced in the cytoplasm of mutant strains ( Fig. 1) in which the thioredoxin and glutathione reducing pathways are blocked (such as Origami and derivatives), whereas the cytoplasmic overexpression of the periplasmic DsbC isomerase (such as in Shuffle T7 Express) can rearrange disulfide bonds involving incorrect cysteine residues. However, the published results obtained with these strains are contradictory [9,10]. Although some groups claim successful production of functional antibody fragments in their cytoplasm, when critically evaluated, the results often indicate very low yields",

[4], was an inflection point in recombinant protein expression research and many reports have followed, exploring the system for a variety of applications [5][6][7][8][9].Until this recent increase in interest, the fast growth rate of V. natriegens [10] was one of the more notable attributes of this Gram-negative bacterium that was isolated from a salt marsh [11].Reports have attributed this fast-growing phenotype to the large number of rRNA operons, and thus ribosomes [4,12,13], or a higher level of substrate uptake [14].Regardless, V. natriegens might have some advantages over E. coli in recombinant protein expression.\n\nThe recent work cites fast growth rate, metabolic diversity, and the emerging development of tools for genetic manipulation as positive factors for the use of V. natriegens [15,16].Fast growth rate was also what induced our lab to investigate the use of this system for recombinant protein production.",

There are numerous established methods for genetic manipulation and the organism is fast growing on inexpensive media up to high cell densities [6][7][8]. All of this leads to high yields of recombinant protein. However, challenges are faced when expressing more complicated eukaryotic proteins in E. coli. The bacterium is not able to perform most post-translational modifications, and expression of membrane proteins is not trivial, as E. coli lacks the inner organelles in which eukaryotic membrane proteins are anchored [5]. An exemplary illustration of a eukaryotic cell with the anchoring of a membrane protein is shown in Figure 3. \n\nIn spite of being membrane proteins, numerous eukaryotic P450s have been successfully expressed in E. coli using different approaches as also reviewed by Zelasko [9].

            "text": "Escherichia coli is the organism of choice when it comes to the recombinant protein production [1]. Despite its weakness as a prokaryote in producing eukaryotic proteins, E. coli has many advantages: We can grow E. coli cultures easily within a short time at a low cost [2]. Its genetics is well known, and various strains have been developed for specific purposes. The usual protocol for producing proteins in E. coli cells includes the cloning of a target gene in an expression plasmid, transformation of a suitable host strain, and then the induction of the target protein synthesis. In theory, this is fairly straightforward, but in practice, there are many things to consider. When things go wrong and no protein is produced or only inclusion bodies are formed, one needs to consider many factors that could influence the transcription and translation of the target gene, including the promoter, terminators, operators, copy numbers for the DNA/plasmid construct, Shine-Dalgarno sequence, rare codons, mRNA secondary structure, and mRNA stability [3]. Furthermore, even if a large amount of the target protein is produced in its soluble form, the activity of the purified protein is not guaranteed. To deal with proteins that were difficult to express, researchers have developed various methods: strains able to translate rare codons [4], strains able to form disulfide bonds in the cytosol [5], plasmids with a special promoter [6], various fusion partners or tags [7][8][9][10][11][12], expression at a low temperature [13], secretion to periplasm [14], co-expression of chaperones [15][16][17][18], and genome engineering [19]. One or more of these measures may work, but finding the right one is usually a laborious and time-consuming process because it is all based on trial-anderror. \n\nThe intracellular composition of metabolites reflects the cell's physiology at a particular time point.",

It is not suitable for production of certain proteins, for example, proteins containing complex disulfide bonds.

Overexpression of membrane proteins adds additional complexity. We applied a variety of techniques, including the adjustment of codon usage bias, evaluation of different promoters and vectors with different copy numbers to regulate the level of gene transcription, evaluation of different leader sequences to guide the secretion and insertion of the target protein into outer membrane, and evaluation of cell culture medium and optimization of cell culture conditions. In this paper, we demonstrated significant improvement for the recombinant expression of Chlamydia MOMP with some of the techniques mentioned above. \n\nCodon usage is a reflection of the relative amounts of cognate aminoacyl tRNAs accessible in the cytoplasm. The synonymous codon usage in all the organisms displays a bias-some codons are used frequently, while others are rarely used. Like others cellular systems, E. coli also shows disparities for synonymous codons where in general major codons are predominantly present in highly expressed genes and rare codon occurs in low level expressed genes. This disproportion of codon frequency preferences becomes highly critical for recombinant expression systems, and can lead to mRNA instability, ribosomal stalling, translation errors or premature translational terminations, and ultimately failure to express recombinant genes by heterologous expression hosts. Reported studies indicated that folding and posttranslational modifications for both membrane and soluble proteins are also susceptible to synonymous codon usage [33].",

In 2010, it was reported that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in E. coli, compared with those expressed in all hosts had remained constant, at roughly 60% per year during the 15 year period 1995-2009 (S\u00f8rensen, 2010). Table 1 includes the corresponding data for the other commonly used host cells; it shows that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in E. coli has remained high to date and that approximately half of these genes are eukaryotic. For all other hosts, the absolute numbers are much smaller, but it is notable that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in Pichia pastoris has steadily increased from 1995 to date, in contrast to all other host cells (Table 1). Coupled with the beginnings of a decline in usage for E. coli over the last 8 years, this could suggest that researchers are beginning to recognize the capacity of P. pastoris to produce more challenging recombinant targets. \n\nEscherichia coli stands out as the pre-eminent host cell for producing recombinant proteins in both commercial [50% of proteins; (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Mattanovich et al., 2012)] and research (>70% of proteins; Table 1) laboratories; it is quick and inexpensive to culture, making it ideal in many respects.

These drawbacks include lack of suitable secretion systems and limited post translational modifications (PTMs; e.g., glycosylation is not trivial in bacterial systems).

            "text": "The first steps for recombinant protein expression have been made back in 1973, where Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer invented the possibility of in vitro DNAcloning (Cohen et al. 1973, Baeshen et al. 2014). This opened the door for the expression of multiple diverse molecules. The first recombinant pharmaceutical product was insulin, licenced back in 1982 (Baeshen et al. 2014).\n\nToday, the main focus of the pharmaceutical market remains on the production of monoclonal antibodies, diverse hormones and growth factors, which turn out to be the majority of the pharmaceutical income (Walsh 2004, Baeshen et al. 2014, Baeshen et al. 2015.\n\nAlthough complex recombinant proteins are mainly produced in mammalian cells, a good number of proteins is still expressed in Escherichia coli (Walsh 2014, Humer et al. 2018. Recently published papers reported that the production of biopharmaceutical proteins in E. coli moved up to a number as high as 40 % (Walsh 2010, Gupta andShukla 2016). Protein production in E. coli gained importance as the demand in single-chain antibody fragments, which can be successfully expressed in E. coli, increased (Spadiut et al. 2013). E. coli is most likely the cheapest organism to cultivate, though its products are hard to purify and therefore take long durations and efforts when it comes to product purification (Berlec and Strukelj 2013). The genome of E. coli is known very well (Huang et al. 2012) and E. coli shows very fast replication rates, resulting in high cell densities (Murarka et al. 2007, Sahdev et al. 2007. Also, cultivations can be carried out on comparatively cheap media, coupled with the little risk of contamination compared to other cultivation hosts (DeLisa et al. 1999). In addition, scale-up can be straightforward, when compared to other organisms. Summing up, protein production using E. coli as a host provides a very useful alternative to mammalian cell cultivations (Baeshen et al. 2015), as e.g. yields up to 4 g/L of soluble antibody fragments have been reported already (Gupta and Shukla 2016).\n\nBesides the classical aim to produce a high",

            "text": "The choice of the host cells that are used for the expression of recombinant proteins has an important influence on protein stability. For example, the protein may be toxic to the host cell or the protein may be cleaved by endogenous proteases made by the cell. Clearly, such issues can be a primary source of compositional instability in proteins. Toxicity can be controlled by tight regulation of the expression level using promoters that respond in a concentration-dependent manner to the inducer. Examples of tightly controlled expression vectors include pBAD, which responds to the inducer l-arabinose (Guzman et al., 1995). The background expression of proteases (and proteins in general) can also be controlled using plasmids that express T7 lysozyme, such as pLysS. T7 lysozyme is a natural inhibitor of T7 RNA polymerase, the promoter utilized in the pET vector system, and can be used to reduce background levels of protein expression (Studier, 1991). Background levels of protease activity can also be reduced using OmpT \u00c0 bacterial strains, which do not express the outer membrane aspartyl protease. Such systems are commercially available as BL21 Star strains of E. coli (Invitrogen/ThermoFisher Scientific).\n\nHost-cell selection is particularly important when expressing mammalian proteins in bacterial cells, as the codon usage between the organisms is different. For example, the AGA codon for arginine is particularly rare in E. coli and can result in premature chain termination, frame-shifting and incorrect amino-acid insertion (Calderone et al., 1996, Kane, 1995. This issue can be addressed in a number of ways, including the generation of a synthetic gene reflecting the codon usage of the host organism or by co-transformation of the host with a plasmid that can provide the tRNA of the missing codons (e.g. CodonPlus, Stratagene and pRARE; EMD Millipore/ Novagen; Dieci et al., 2000;Fu et al., 2007). Competent E. coli BL21 cells containing the pRARE plasmid are commercially available under the trade name Rosetta. These cells have been used to optimize the",

Products of these industries, in turn, augment the fields of medicine, diagnostics, food, nutrition, detergents, textiles, leather, paper, pulp and plastics. 1 Enzymes are synthesized by all living organisms as part of their natural metabolism, serving as biocatalysts to increase the rate of the metabolic reactions. The enzyme production rate, yield, quality and functionality are the most important factors to be considered when industrial recombinant enzymes are produced in hosts. 2 The choice of an expression system for the high-level production of recombinant enzymes depends on many factors. These include cell growth characteristics, expression levels, intracellular and extracellular expression, post-translational modifications and biological activity of the protein of interest, as well as regulatory issues in the production of the therapeutic proteins. 3 Moreover, the cost breakdown in terms of process and design and other economic considerations is required for the selection of a particular expression system. 4 Recombinant enzymes have been expressed in Escherichia coli, Bacilli (e.g., Bacillus subtilis) and lactic acid bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus lactis), filamentous fungi (e.g., Aspergillus) and yeasts (e.g., Pichia pastoris).

There is an expanding choice of tightly regulated prokaryotic promoters suitable for achieving high-level gene expression. New host strains facilitate the formation of disulfide bonds in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm and offer higher protein yields by minimizing proteolytic degradation. Insights into the process of protein translocation across the bacterial membranes may eventually make it possible to achieve robust secretion of specific proteins into the culture medium. Studies involving molecular chaperones have shown that in specific cases, chaperones can be very effective for improved protein folding, solubility, and membrane transport. Negative results derived from such studies are also instructive in formulating different strategies. The remarkable increase in the availability of fusion partners offers a wide range of tools for improved protein folding, solubility, protection from proteases, yield, and secretion into the culture medium, as well as for detection and purification of recombinant proteins. Codon usage is known to present a potential impediment to high-level gene expression in E. coli. Although we still do not understand all the rules governing this phenomenon, it is apparent that \"rare\" codons, depending on their frequency and context, can have an adverse effect on protein levels. Usually, this problem can be alleviated by modification of the relevant codons or by coexpression of the cognate tRNA genes. Finally, the elucidation of specific determinants of protein degradation, a plethora of protease-deficient host strains, and methods to stabilize proteins afford new strategies to minimize proteolytic susceptibility of recombinant proteins in E. coli.",

            "text": "EYcient recombinant protein expression is a major bottleneck for structural genomics and proteomics. Despite progress in automation, soluble protein expression is frequently the rate-limiting step for many researchers. The preferred host for recombinant protein expression has historically been Escherichia coli (E. coli) due to the simplicity and low costs associated with using this host. While E. coli has proved a successful host for the expression of many heterologous proteins, it is frequently not capable of expressing soluble heterologous proteins. The Southeast Collaboratory for Structural Genomics (SECSG) 1 reports that of the 6386 proteins they have expressed in E. coli only 22.7% (1452) have been soluble (as published on SECSG web page 03/04/ 2005). Much advancement has been made toward improving recombinant protein expression in E. coli, including the development of strong promoters [1], coexpression with chaperones [2], and through the use of protein fusions. No other technology has been as eVective at improving the solubility of recombinant proteins as fusion systems, especially for diYcult-to-express proteins. A variety of structures have been used as fusion motifs (Table 1). These fusion proteins are frequently employed to enhance protein expression and facilitate puriWcation [3][4][5]. There is no particular similarity among these proteins in terms of molecular weight, structure, or function, with the exception of ubiquitin (Ub) and SUMO, which share a common structure [6]. This review will discuss the advantages of fusion technologies. These advantages include the manner in which protein expression is enhanced, proteolytic degradation of the target protein is decreased, protein folding and solubility are increased, and puriWcation and detection are simpliWed. The main disadvantage of fusion technology, cleaving the protein fusion, is also covered. In addition, focus is given to the newly described SUMO fusion systems. SUMO fusions appear to have all of the advantages of traditional fusion systems, and due to the activity of SUMO proteases do not encounter the same diYculties with cleavage.",

It is difficult to decide which combination of host organism-promoter system would be the best for specific recombinant protein production; therefore this still has to be optimized for each product individually. \n\nSince Escherichia coli have all the above described advantages [1] and the laboratory strains are regarded as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) organisms, it is still one of the most commonly used bacterial host system, not only on laboratory scale use, but also for production of therapeutic proteins [2][3][4][5]. \n\nHowever, during recombinant protein production in E. coli, proteins often tend to aggregate into protein particles called inclusion bodies (IBs). Until recently, IBs were considered as deposits of misfolded and inactive proteins and represented bottleneck in recombinant protein production. Therefore many pharmaceutically interesting proteins have been disregarded for commercialization [6]. Nevertheless, the latest studies on protein aggregation have shown that protein aggregation into IBs does not necessarily imply protein inactivation [7][8][9][10] thus studies on protein aggregation has become an important subject in many fields, including biology, medicine and biotechnology [11]. This article gives an overview on the latest trends in recombinant protein production in E. coli, their aggregation and the possible applications of such protein particles (IBs).",

            "text": "Abstract Production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli expression systems has shown many advantages, as well as disadvantages, especially for biotechnological and other down-stream applications. The choice of an appropriate vector depends on the gene, to be cloned for purification procedures and other analyses. Selection of a suitable production strain plays an important role in the preparation of recombinant proteins. The main criteria for the selection of the host organism are the properties of the recombinant produced protein, its subsequent use and the total amount desired. The most common problems in eukaryotic gene expression and recombinant proteins purification are, for instance, post-translational modifications, formation of disulphide bonds, or inclusion bodies. Obtaining a purified protein is a key step enabling further characterization of its role in the biological system. Moreover, methods of protein purification have been developed in parallel with the discovery of proteins and the need for their studies and applications. After protein purification, and also between the individual purification steps, it is necessary to test protein stability under different conditions over time. Shortly, all the essential points have been briefly discussed, which could be encountered during production and purification of a recombinant protein of interest, especially from eukaryotic source and expressed heterogeneously in prokaryotic production system.",

            "text": "In 1972, the creation of the first recombinant DNA molecules was reported (Jackson et al., 1972). Not long thereafter, a study describing the \"Construction of Biologically Functional Bacterial Plasmids In Vitro\" was published (Cohen et al., 1973). Together with the development of methodology to chemically synthesize DNA, these two studies paved the way for using Escherichia coli as a host for producing recombinant proteins (Itakura et al., 1977). In 1976, the company Genentech-its name is a play of words of \"genetic engineering\" and \"technology\"-was founded and it pioneered the use of E. coli for the production of therapeutic proteins (Hughes, 2011). The foundation of Genentech is widely considered as the start of recombinant DNA driven biotechnology. Based on a collaborative effort between Genentech and Eli Lilly, human insulin (a.k.a. humulin), became in 1982 the first recombinantly produced therapeutic protein approved by the FDA for human use (Crea et al., 1978;Goeddel et al., 1979). For the production of humulin, the A and B chains of insulin were produced in the cytoplasm of two different E. coli strains as C-terminal fusions to \u03b2-galactosidase ( Figure 1). After partial purification of the chimeric proteins, the insulin chains were released from the fusion proteins by cyanogen treatment. Subsequently, the released A and B chains were purified and joined through air oxidation resulting in functional insulin.\n\nFirst, recombinant proteins, like above mentioned \u03b2-galactosidase insulin fusion proteins, were produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli (e.g., (Itakura et al., 1977;Goeddel et al., 1979)). Later on, based on increasing knowledge of protein export in E. coli, recombinant proteins were also produced in the periplasm of E. coli (e.g., (Fraser and Bruce, 1978;Talmadge et al., 1980)). What are the (potential) benefits of producing a protein in the periplasm of E. coli rather than in its cytop",

            "text": "Cellular energy conservation and utilisation efficiency often imply that enzyme syntheses have feedback mechanisms and various other factors that prevent excessive production of all metabolites, including enzymes. Moreover, some organisms that are capable of enzyme over-expression may not necessarily be amenable to manageable growth conditions in the laboratory. Sometimes, the feasible solution to these challenges is the application of recombinant technology, involving the modification of a more amenable organism by integrating DNA molecules of the desired traits to allow its over-expression in the host organism, achieved through the use of a vector [155]. Since the introduction of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s, it has contributed greatly to the large-scale production of many important proteins, including enzymes, in fields ranging from agriculture to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics [156,157]. Over the years, different expression hosts have been developed for recombinant protein production. In their work, Tripathi and Shrivastava [158] review these expression hosts, including bacteria, mammalian cells, yeasts, insects, and transgenic plants. The authors also point out the importance of using eukaryotic hosts to produce therapeutic proteins, as these require post-translational modifications, especially glycosylation, for their efficacy. As previously discussed, PTMs play a crucial role in eukaryotic protein stability, solubility, and functionality. As such, PTMs must therefore be considered during the selection of the host for recombinant protein production. Von Schaewen et al. [159] further explain this attribute as they discuss the limitations of bacterial hosts such as E. coli for the production of recombinant eukaryotic proteins. \n\nBesides host selection, recombinant protein production also relies greatly on the effectiveness of cloning. The expression of recombinant eukaryotic proteins involves cloning of the cDNA of interest into an appropriate expression vector, followed by its insertion into the host cell [156]. Several cloning vectors are available depending on the intended use. Various cloning methods have also been developed. Jia and Jeon [160] describe different cloning methods and their possible applications for high-throughput recombinant protein production.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a microorganism that is one of the earliest hosts and extremely useful for production of heterologous proteins with commercial interest at large scale for structural and functional studies. 77,78 E. coli genetics are far better understood than those of other microorganisms. Advanced genetic tools convert this bacterium to a valuable host for expression of complex eukaryotic proteins. Moreover, ability of rapid growth, high expression level, avoidance of incorporation of amino acid analogs, formation of intracellular disulfide bonds, alteration of metabolic carbon flow and cheapness are the other advantages of this system. 56,79 O'Reilly et al. used E. coli expression system beside the insect expression system, for the first time. They obtained insoluble murine recombinant endostatin and compared this protein with native form derived from collagen XVIII and recombinant protein that was expressed in insect expression system. They declared that the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation was similar in all of the three derived forms. More than 99% of the protein derived from E. coli was insoluble and lost during centrifugation. 11 Generally, protein concentration and the pH of refolding buffer are very essential factors in the refolding process of recombinant proteins. 80 In this point, for overcoming the production of insoluble rEs, You et al. designed an applied new method for refolding and purification of murine endostatin in E. coli system for the first time in 1999. For this purpose, they refolded the protein in the presence of chaotrophic agent (urea and guanidine-Hcl) and redox-coupling reagents such as glutathione. This protein was comparable to the one obtained from the use of Yeast-expression system in physiochemical properties and also in anti-angiogenic activities. 81 In another study, production of soluble recombinant murine endostatin was the main aim of study. A purification method was developed by Huang et al. in order to production of an effective and soluble rEs. Their study was resulted in production of 150 mg/liter-culture and 99% purity of recombinant murine endostatin. 82",

            "text": "Many efforts have been made to produce recombinant proteins on a large industrial scale. Heterologous protein expression in the platform host by the introduction of the gene of interest is the most promising approach in several aspects. Heterologous expression hosts can overcome the complexities associated with native hosts, such as slow and fastidious growth, limited molecular biology tools, scarce genetic information, and low productivity (Park et al., 2020). Several representative heterologous expression hosts have been used according to their specialized characteristics and product types (Huo et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2019;Kang and Kim, 2021;Pham et al., 2021). For example, Escherichia coli is the most extensively studied and used for heterologous protein expression, as it exhibits rapid growth, ease of genetic manipulation, and high productivity. Bacillus subtilis is another extensively used Gram-positive bacteria that acts as an efficient workhorse for the production of industrial enzymes and pharmaceuticals, having robust growth and good genetic tractability, along with many endogenous proteases. Beyond the microbial hosts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a commonly used eukaryotic host for recombinant protein production due to its recombinant DNA stability, easy genome engineering strategies, and the ability to provide post-translational modifications. Recently, a high-throughput platform for heterologous protein expression for fungal biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in S. cerevisiae, named HEx, was established to successfully produce diverse fungal secondary metabolites (SMs) (Harvey et al., 2018). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the mammalian cell line that dominates the other recombinant protein production hosts because of their capacity to express large and complex recombinant proteins, but genetic engineering and clonal selection are more difficult than microbial hosts. \n\nAmong the potential microbial chassis, the genus Streptomyces, a soil-derived Gram-positive bacterium with a high GC content genome, is an attractive microbial host for heterologous protein expression (Liu et al., 2018a).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) is still one of the most commonly convenient production systems because of low cost, effi ciency, suitability for large-scale cultivation and easy manipulation (1). However, over-expression of the recombinant non-bacterial proteins in E. coli (higher than 2 % of cellular protein) led to misfolding or incomplete folding processes. These structures could be accumulated as insoluble aggregates found in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces of E. coli as so-called inclusion bodies (1)(2)(3). Although, the expression of protein as inclusion bodies has a high yield, the procedures for separation, washing and solubilization of inclusion bodies and native form of the recombinant heterologous protein are often time-consuming and diffi cult (4,5). The recent studies showed that a large part of proteins in inclusion bodies is functional and thus can be used for multiple applications without being solubilized and refolded (6). However, several strategies are available to minimize the formation of inclusion bodies such as manipulation of growth temperature, medium composition, dose of inducer, induction time, and plasmid-related properties including promoter, copy number and host strain. For some pro-teins, these strategies were ineffective to get a soluble product (7,8). As known, the green fl uorescent protein (GFP) could be used to generate fl uorescent fusion proteins. Most GFP fusion proteins were constructed by placing GFP at either N-or C-terminus of the host protein. These structures could damage the function of some host proteins. Another approach was tested to insert GFP into the middle of the host protein. However, fi nding a suitable site for insertion of GFP was problematic and time-consuming (9). Thus, the production of some GFP fusion proteins was often performed in eukaryotic expression systems such as insect or yeast (10,11). In this study, we attempted to generate a biologically active fl uorescent fusion protein in an E. coli system.",

            "text": "The Escherichia coli pET expression system remains one of the most popular systems for recombinant protein production (Shilling et al., 2020). Numerous strategies have been proposed to improve recombinant protein production, including codon optimization of target proteins (Burgess-Brown et al., 2008;Menzella, 2011;Chung and Lee, 2012), screening and construction of a superior host cell (Choi et al., 2015;Liu et al., 2015;Hayat et al., 2018), addition of fusion tags (Esposito and Chatterjee, 2006;Young et al., 2012;Hayat et al., 2018), optimization of expression elements (Gustafsson et al., 2012;Eichmann et al., 2019), or the development of high-density fermentation processes (Yee and Blanch, 1992;Zhang et al., 2000;Thongekkaew et al., 2008). Although E. coli is highly amenable to genetic modification and has a clear genetic background, quite many genes of interest (GOIs) were not well-expressed in E. coli. Furthermore, contamination of fermentation processes with other microorganisms or phages is a common problem that requires an urgent solution (Samson et al., 2013;Ou et al., 2020). Developing alternative hosts that possess a distinct spectrum of highly expressed GOIs complementary to E. coli and compatible with the pET expression system is an attractive way to solve this problem (Calero and Nikel, 2019). \n\nVibrio natriegens, a Gram-negative, non-pathogenic marine bacterium (Payne, 1958), is considered the fastest growing freeliving bacterium, with a doubling time between 7 and 10 min under optimal conditions (Eagon, 1962;Weinstock et al., 2016;Lee et al., 2019). Estimates for the number of ribosomes in V. natriegens in the exponential phase suggest around 115,000 per cell, while E. coli is estimated to have only 70,000-90,000 (Des Soye et al., 2018), which partly explains its greater biomass synthesis rate and stronger protein expression ability (Zhu et al., 2020).",

Moreover, l-tyrosine and p-coumaric acid, the key precursors of caffeic acid, are crucial for increasing caffeic acid production and easy to be improved in E. coli (Shrestha et al., 2019). In addition, E. coli is better suited for caffeic acid production than yeast due to its superior tolerance to p-coumaric acid (Shin et al., 2011;Zhang and Stephanopoulos, 2013;Li et al., 2020). The first attempt to produce caffeic acid in E. coli was described by Choi et al. (2011), who introduced C3H from Saccharothrix espanaensis into E. coli C41 (DE3) strain and achieved caffeic acid with the supplementation of precursor p-coumaric acid. However, a significant limitation of using E. coli as an expression host is its lack of capacity for post-translational modifications, which are typically necessary for the correct folding and functional activity of recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a preferred microorganism for the production of recombinant proteins. E. coli is mainly used for cloning, genetic modification, and small-scale production, and the mechanisms of these processes have been thoroughly studied. E. coli has been widely used in the studies of heterologous medicinal proteins because of its clearly defined genetic background, fast reproduction, low cost, high expression level, stable 2 H/ 13 C/ 15 N isotope labeling technology, and wide range of applications (Nuc and Nuc, 2006). However, as a prokaryote, E. coli has no regulatory mechanism for eukaryotic gene expression and it lacks the ability to catalyze posttranslational modifications (PTMs), especially modifications catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which severely limits its application as a recombinant drug factory. PTMs play important roles in the folding, processing, stability, glycosylation, final biological activity, and immunogenicity of the proteins. A previous study has shown that transfer of the N-linked glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni to E. coli may produce glycosylated proteins (Wacker et al., 2002). Deficiency of the E. coli expression system for pharmaceutical protein production was overcome by a series of optimization strategies, such as codon optimization (Burgess-Brown et al., 2008), vector construction (Hayashi and Kojima, 2008), development of a new secretion system to reduce inclusion body formation (Cheng et al., 2017), and self-induction (Briand et al., 2016), to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli and to determine the best strategy. \n\nBacillus subtilis is an alternate host for the expression and secretion of heterologous proteins in some cases. Comparison with E. coli indicates that B. subtilis has strong protein secretion ability and does not easily form inclusion bodies. Moreover, B. subtilis is not pathogenic and has been used as a cell factory for producing enzymes, vitamins, and functional sugars in the expression systems for over a decade (van Dijl and Hecker, 2013).",

            "text": "In recent research, Escherichia coli (E. coli) has established itself as one of the most extensively used systems in the industrial production of recombinant proteins, which owes much to the high yield of production that is possible with this system, the low manufacturing cost, a wellcharacterized expression system, and amenability to high cell-density fermentation biotechnology [1,2]. In addition, due to a lack of appropriate folding-assistance proteins and cofactors that can mediate post-translational modifications, the likelihood of inclusion body formation is considerately high when heterologous proteins are expressed in E. coli [3]. However, continuous endeavors have been devoted to overcome such limitations. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering strategies, there are many solutions that can potentially provide successful expression of soluble recombinant proteins in an E. coli expression system, including choosing a suitable expression host and vector, codon usage, sequence optimization, inducer concentration, expression temperature, fusion technology and co-expression of a chaperone. \n\nTherapeutic and diagnostic proteins as biopharmaceuticals have been applied widely particularly in respect of the broader interest in recombinant technology. These proteins are required in sufficient quantities; however, it remains a challenge to obtain enough proteins from natural sources. To express eukaryotic proteins in E. coli, the concept of fusion technology represents an effective method to enhance protein solubility [4]. In a contemporary study, fusion expression vectors provide useful tools to strengthen the solubility and productivity of eukaryotic proteins, including Maltose-binding protein (MBP), N-utilization substance A (NusA), Thioredoxin A (Trx) and translation initiation factor 2 domain I (IF2). Furthermore, it has recently been determined that fusion partners like the Fasciola hepatica 8 kDa antigen (Fh8), the E. coli secreted protein A (EspA) and KDPG aldolase (EDA) have emerged with the intent of improving synthetic yields, enhancing solubility and folding processes and simplifying the purification of eukaryotic proteins [3][4][5].",

            "text": "Since the first functional recombinant protein was expressed in 1977 (Itakura et al., 1977), bacteria have been the most widely used system for heterologous expression of proteins. Consequently, over time, a whole plethora of tools have been developed to improve bacteria for protein expression in both small and large scales.\n\nThe domain Bacteria comprises a vast number of physiologically and metabolically well-characterized organisms. Fundamental research on bacterial physiology has provisioned a knowledge-based framework to rationally design processes in a sophisticated manner (Carr and Church, 2009;Choe et al., 2016). The acquired knowledge has led to a collection of genetically engineered bacterial chassis for heterologous toxin expression. Among all bacterial hosts used for recombinant protein production, Escherichia coli is the most widely utilized. E. coli adapts to a large range of physical and chemical culture conditions while accumulating recombinant proteins up to 80% of its dry weight. Using E. coli, it is possible to express proteins that are safe to administer as biotherapeutics, with efficient methods to remove endotoxins in place (Mamat et al., 2015;Schneier et al., 2020). Even though bacterial systems possess considerable advantages, the main challenge in producing toxins from eukaryotic organisms in bacteria is the correct formation of disulfide bonds and the incorporation of PTMs that prokaryotic systems cannot introduce. Nevertheless, many genetic tools and techniques exist for expressing recombinant proteins, such as optimized bacterial strains, co-expression with chaperones or foldases, and the use of various promoters for tightly regulated expression ( Figure 3).\n\nAnimal toxins have been recombinantly expressed in microbial systems since the early 1990s (Boyot et al., 1990;Fiordalisi et al., 1991;Park et al., 1991;Dudler et al., 1992;Kelley et al., 1992). To date, bacterial expression still remains the preferred system for the heterologous expression of toxins, especially for small and cysteine-less toxins like actinoporins from sea anemones (Alegre-Cebollada et al., 2007).

However, the low secretion efficiency, incomplete secretion of recombinant protein, insufficient capacity for secretion of overexpressed recombinant protein, the death of host cells, and proteolytic degradation of the product in E. coli periplasmic expression systems are problematic despite some successful examples (16). The intracellular produc-tion of recombinant proteins in E. coli cytoplasm which is widely used has several advantages over the secretion of recombinant proteins to the periplasm; however, improper folding of many target proteins may occur during this process. \n\nImproper folding often results in the formation of inclusion bodies despite attempts to optimize the growth condition (17). No significant property was detected to recognize those proteins that have tendency to make inclusion bodies. Correct folding of proteins in cytoplasm can be achieved using several methods which are protein-specific, such as culturing at low temperatures, lowering the protein expression. Although the high protein production in the cytoplasm makes the purification of the soluble target proteins difficult, inclusion bodies have several advantages compared to soluble proteins including the higher accumulation in cytoplasm and increased protein yields as they are proteolysis-resistant, which could be isolated by a simple centrifugation step (15). Accordingly, choosing a suitable strategy to produce a recombinant protein is completely protein-specific.",

Factors, such as lack of glycosylation, easier production, high expression levels, high cell densities, and low production costs compared to other available expression platforms contribute to popularity of the E. coli platform. \n\nThe last few decades have witnessed significant advancements in cloning strategies, expression, and purification, thereby resulting in improved production of useful antibody-like fragments utilizing E. coli expression system. [1,2] he production process is typically quite simple. The desired gene of interest is cloned into a suitable expression vector, which is further transformed into choice of host, cultivated and induced, and protein is extracted and purified. Post purification, the protein is further characterized for structure and function. [3] However, production of recombinant antibody fragments is typically marred by low expression level and poor refolding yield (if expressed as inclusion bodies). Researchers have reported poor growth of cells and formation of inclusion bodies as the practical obstacles associated to expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. A wide range of cultivation techniques, such as media composition, temperature, agitation, aeration and concentration of inducers, induction time and molecular techniques are currently in use for high level production of recombinant proteins to overcome the practical problems. Synergistic effects of the physical parameters along with feeding strategies might significantly improve the expression of Fab in microbial expression system. Modified strain with oxidative environment and cell free system developments have been reported to offer enhancement in the expression of biomolecules. [1] One approach involved co-expression of chaperones with the Fab to facilitate its proper folding into a desired conformation retaining its target-binding activity. Alternatively, in vitro Fab refolding from inclusion bodies has been demonstrated. However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production.

The study of proteins was a complex task before the advent of genetic engineering because they had to be obtained from natural sources with low concentrations, making purification processes challenging and yielding limited amounts. However, the development of recombinant DNA technology has allowed science to make a qualitative leap in this field of research. The production of recombinant insulin in Escherichia coli in the 1970s was a significant milestone, not only revolutionizing the treatment of diabetes but also initiating the use of recombinant proteins for a wide number of applications [1,2]. This breakthrough sparked a surge in biological and structural studies on proteins. Over the past nearly 50 years, the market for recombinant proteins in industries, biomedicine, and research has continued to expand, underscoring the importance of this biotechnological field [3]. Therapeutic proteins are now used in human health for the treatment of diabetes, cancer, infectious disorders, hemophilia, and anemia, and serve as indispensable tools in the diagnosis of numerous diseases [4]. In addition, recombinant proteins are used in animal production and health [5]. Moreover, the production of recombinant proteins has contributed to an exponential growth in scientific knowledge concerning the three-dimensional structure of proteins and has been instrumental in elucidating their functions [6,7]. Therefore, achieving controlled and high-performance production systems for recombinant proteins remains a top priority. \n\nDespite advances in understanding the physiology of producing cells and the physicochemical characteristics of proteins, obtaining certain recombinant proteins still poses technological challenges due to high protein complexity and the intricacies of biological production systems. In some environments, recombinant proteins may undergo proteolysis, aggregation, or be produced in meager quantities [8]. Homologous expression systems offer an effective alternative for producing eukaryotic proteins that often undergo complex post-translational modifications. These systems create conditions favoring the accumulation of functional proteins.",

            "text": "Abstract The microbial expression system (Escherichia coli) is the most widely studied host for the production of biotherapeutic products, such as antibody fragments, single chain variable fragments and nanobodies. However, recombinant biotherapeutic proteins are often expressed as insoluble proteins, thereby limiting the utility of E. coli as expression system. To overcome this limitation, various strategies have been developed, such as changes at DNA level (codon optimization), fusion with soluble tags and variations in process parameters (temperature), and inducer concentration. However, there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d strategy. The most commonly used approach involves induction at low temperature, as reducing the temperature during cultivation has been reported to increase bioactive protein production in E. coli. In this study, we examine the impact of various process parameters, such as temperature and inducer concentration, as well as, high plasmid copy number vector for achieving enhanced soluble expression of TNF\u03b1 inhibitor Fab. An interaction amongst these parameters has been observed and their optimization has been demonstrated to result in expression of 30\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009mg/L antibody fragment using E. coli. This case study illustrates how process optimization can contribute toward making biotherapeutics affordable.",

            "text": "Without a doubt, E. coli is the most widely used host for heterologous gene expression. It has been used for this purpose for more than 40 years, so there is much accumulated knowledge about its advantages and disadvantages as an expression platform. Rosano and Ceccarelli review the tools at hand (expression vectors, strains, media composition, etc.) when using E. coli as a host (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Different approaches for solving common problems, such as inclusion body (IB) formation or low yield, are also presented. \n\nOther authors delve a little deeper into these issues. Costa and coauthors give a thorough description of different fusion tags that can be appended to the target protein in order to increase its solubility and/or ease its purification from the cellular milieu (Costa et al., 2014). Along this line, Correa and coauthors present a very promising approach to straightforwardly assess the solubility of a recombinant protein by cloning the corresponding gene in 12 different expression vectors in parallel (Correa et al., 2014). Even though IB formation is mainly regarded as a nuance in the production of recombinant proteins, Ramon and coworkers make the case that this is not always true and focus on the positive side of IBs, highlighting the advantages of producing recombinant proteins as IBs for basic and applied research (Ramon et al., 2014). No or low yield can be the result of codon bias and Elena and coauthors look into one of the strategies used for solving this problem, the expression of codon optimized genes (Elena et al., 2014). Of great importance is their account of the application of this technology in the industrial setting. Not always the desired product is a protein, sometimes metabolites and fine chemicals are the goal. The review of Ceccoli and coauthors details with numerous examples how E. coli and other microorganisms can be turned into biocatalysts by strain engineering (Ceccoli et al., 2014). High-value products can thus be obtained from pure recombinant enzyme or from whole-cell systems, turning the host into an exquisitely designed and environmentally friendly chemical factory.",

            "text": "The most common E. coli-based expression system is the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and T7 promoter controlled gene expression combination. IPTGinduction of the chromosomally encoded bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase leads to high level expression of T7 promoter-controlled genes and correspondingly high recombinant protein titers. High level recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli frequently leads to an impact on host cell metabolism detectable through growth retardation and generally known as \"metabolic burden\" [1,2]. The factors contributing to the metabolic burden are multifaceted depending on the host/vector combination and on the properties of the encoded gene with its transcription and translation products as well as on the environmental conditions encountered during the production process [3][4][5][6]. The prime reasons for the protein production related metabolic burden have been attributed to protein translation and protein folding [1,6] as well as to transcription and plasmid amplification related processes [7][8][9]. However, production of the same protein under identical conditions in the same host/vector combination but with single codon exchanges can change the metabolic perturbations considerably [10][11][12][13] suggesting that the phenomenon is even more complex than anticipated. \n\nIn this contribution we analyze the impact of T7-promoter-controlled recombinant gene expression on the host cell metabolism using two different model proteins, the difficult-to-fold human basic fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-2) with its high propensity to form inclusion bodies in E. coli and the easy-to-fold green fluorescent protein (GFP) mainly produced as soluble protein. \n\nFor both examples we generated a set of expression vectors in which either the ribosome binding site (RBS) or the promoter region or both were removed in order to analyze if the plasmid itself, the transcription of the recombinant gene, the translation into the protein product and/or protein folding related processes have an impact on host cell metabolism.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is the most commonly used host strain for the expression of heterologous proteins and biocatalysts (12,18). These recombinant proteins are usually synthesized intracellularly in either the cytoplasm or the periplasmic space (2), and overall productivity is a function of both cell density and specific yield. Proteins such as interferons, interleukin and growth hormones are some of the recombinant proteins successfully expressed in E. coli (4). However, E. coli has a number of limitations in its expression system, including inability to carry out post-translational changes, common in eukaryotic cells, lack of secretion system for efficient release of the recombinant protein into the culture medium (1). Protein Vaz, M.R.F. et al. \n\nProduction of eIF antigen from L. chagasi expression in cytoplasm often leads to inadequate protein structure and agglutination in insoluble inclusion bodies (16). \n\nWith the advent of recombinant DNA technology, recombinant protein expression has become an important tool in the study of the structure, function and identification of new proteins, especially those with therapeutic functions, allowing for the manufacture of drugs capable of controlling particular diseases (3,14). \n\nLeishmaniases are illnesses caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania, which, depending on the species, may produce cutaneous, mucocutaneous, diffuse or visceral manifestations (13). American visceral leishmaniasis or kalaazar is the most severe form of this disease. Untreated visceral leishmaniasis results in death within two years of initial infection (5). Despite significant advances in molecular biology and infection immunology, there are as yet no prophylactic drugs capable of preventing this disease, justifying the need to identify specific antigens, in order to develop vaccines and diagnostic kits against visceral leishmaniasis (11).",

            "text": "Bacterial expression systems are commonly used to obtain recombinant antigens due to their ease of handling, high level of expression capacity, fast growth rate, high productivity, short-run production, and reduced manufacturing cost [17,18].Escherichia coli, a gramnegative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium, is widely used as a study model and is easy to engineer and adapt to new environmental conditions [19,20].Despite extensive investigation of novel systems, E. coli remains the dominant host in use [21].Reagents, equipment, and upstream processing for this platform have significantly lower costs than other expression systems [22].However, there are some drawbacks to this system, including the absence of more complex post-translational modifications (PTMs), which can lead to the expression of misfolded, insoluble, or nonfunctional proteins [23].Additionally, the manufacturing process should consider the removal of contaminant endotoxins, usually lipopolysaccharides, generated in this system.Although vaccines based on recombinant antigens offer several advantages over other vaccines, most of these present weak or poor immunogenicity when administered alone, thereby requiring the use of adjuvants to elicit a protective and long-lasting immune response [24].\n\nDespite being the most abundant and highly conserved outer membrane protein in the entire leptospiral proteome, the lipoprotein LipL32 [25] cannot stimulate a protective immune response when purified from the E. coli expression system and used as a subunit vaccine [26,27].However, coadministration with the highly immunogenic B subunit of E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin may enhance the immune-stimulating capability of LipL32, with protection ranging from 40 to 100% following a lethal challenge in hamsters [28].Additionally, the LipL32 protein from serovar Autumnalis produced in E. coli and administered as a subunit vaccine in association with Freund or aluminum hydroxide with QS21 [29] provided 0-50% protection in gerbils challenged with L. interrogans serovar Canicola.",

            "text": "However, recent progress has been made in engineering defined glycosylation pathways in E. coli (Valderrama-Rincon et al., 2012), while the Keio collection of single-gene knockout mutants offers a route to understanding the molecular bottlenecks to high yields in this prokaryotic host (Baba et al., 2006). \n\nIn principle, the use of mammalian cell-lines should overcome the challenges of producing recombinant eukaryotic proteins in E. coli, especially with recent advances in stable recombinant gene expression (Bandaranayake and Almo, 2013;Kunert and Casanova, 2013). Furthermore, the authenticity of glycosylation performed by mammalian host cells is an important advantage over all other expression hosts. However, progress in the technologies that enable reproducible gene delivery and selection of stable clones continues to be slow (Bandaranayake and Almo, 2013). Moreover, specific yields from mammalian cell-lines are often low (Zhu, 2012) and Table 1 shows a declining trend in their use. \n\nEukaryotic microbes offer substantial advantages as host cells, despite their propensity to hyperglycosylate recombinant proteins. For example, an annotated genome sequence has been available for S. cerevisiae for almost two decades (Goffeau et al., 1996), an impressive range of deletion and over-expression strains are readily available for S. cerevisiae and the P. pastoris genome has been available since 2009 (De Schutter et al., 2009). Combining this wealth of molecular and genetic resources, with the fact that yeasts grow an order of magnitude more rapidly than mammalian cell-lines means that protein production and optimization can be done quickly and efficiently in yeast (Porro et al., 2011). Table 1 shows that for P. pastoris, at least, there is an increasing trend in its usage suggesting that these advantages have become more widely known. This is especially notable because P. pastoris is a relative new-comer, only having been first developed as a host system in 1985 (Cregg et al., 1985).",

            "text": "B. subtilis offers many advantages for use in the production of recombinant proteins. Unlike the Gram-negative E. coli, B. subtilis is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) because it is non-pathogenic and nontoxic [1,2]. In addition, B. subtilis is well known for its high capacity to secrete proteins [3]. Many modifications of the host strain improved the secretion of recombinant protein production [4]. The expression systems also developed in B. subtilis [5]. Most studies on the intracellular production of recombinant proteins have focused on B. subtilis [6] using promoter elements optimized for strong expression [7]. Vectors based on Pgrac100 were developed that showed high protein production levels in B. subtilis and decreased basal expression in E. coli [8]. Modifications of IPTG-inducible promoters have resulted in inducer-free expression plasmids [9], while some reporter genes have been successfully expressed in the cytoplasm of B. subtilis like BgaB [7][8][9], GFP [7,9], and GUS [10]. An optimal combination of strong promoters, transcription terminators, and various translation/secretion signals can achieve a high protein expression level [11]. In addition, the fusion tag also significantly affects the production levels of intracellular proteins. \n\nFusion tags are short peptides or proteins attached to the N-or Cterminus of the target protein to enhance production, increase solubility and facilitate its purification [12]. Fusion tags include short sequences such as polyhistidine (poly-His), polyarginine (poly-Arg), FLAG, c-myc, or Strep-tag, and proteins such as maltose-binding protein (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), N-utilization substance A (NusA), thioredoxin (Trx), small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) [13,14]. The larger tags are often used to increase the solubility of target proteins [15].",

            "text": "In recent years, there has been tremendous expansion in the variety of products and processes available for the manufacture and purification of recombinant proteins. Recombinant proteins are increasingly being used in industrial settings and academic research, and for medicinal and diagnostic purposes [21,22]. For diagnostic purposes, one of the components of the TB diagnostic kit that we devised was independently made in order to support the national independence of medical devices. In this study, we produced the MPT64 target protein by over-expressing the synthetic MPT64-encoding gene in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The most often utilized host microbe in biotechnology is Escherichia coli. E. coli can be used to produce heterologous proteins because of a number of benefits. Despite these benefits, making recombinant proteins in E. coli has certain drawbacks, such as the development of inclusion bodies, ineffective protein translocation, and metabolic cost [21]. Bacterial growth is a complicated process that involves metabolite synthesis (anabolic) and the breakdown (catabolic) of various cell components [22]. The MPT64 protein used in this investigation was produced as a recombinant protein without a tag for protein purification. Thus, the pelB signaling peptide was fused to this MPT64 protein to be released into the medium. In our earlier investigation, the MPT64 protein was translocated across the host cell membrane of E. coli by using pelB as a signal peptide [23]. Another study that utilized the same signal peptide and cell host reported the effectiveness of pelB in releasing protein into a medium [24]. Nevertheless, the yield of the MPT64 protein extracellular recovery was still poor in our prior investigation, and a large amount of this protein remained trapped in the cytoplasm and periplasm [23]. In accordance with this, it has been extensively documented that the periplasm is always where the challenge of expressing extracellular proteins in E. coli is located [25].",

Several plasmids of differing sizes have been recovered from numerous bacterial species. Plasmids may be used to genetically modify bacteria for a variety of reasons, including the generation of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most often utilised bacterium for the production of recombinant proteins owing to its quick growth rate, low cost, high yield of recombinant proteins, and simple scale-up procedure. To boost the synthesis of heterologous proteins in E. coli, a number of plasmids have been used. Diverse plasmids have been devised and built to address challenges such as protein refolding, E. coli codon use, a lack of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, and insufficient recovery of functionally viable recombinant proteins. Recent technical advancements that have made it possible for the E. coli expression system to create more complex proteins, such as glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies.",

            "text": "Obtaining enough quantities of the target protein in a soluble, pure, and homogeneous state from its natural host is very uncommon, making the expression of the target in a recombinant form a routine practice for many academic laboratories and industry. In this regard, Escherichia coli has been the most widely used host for recombinant protein since its introduction in 1977 for the expression of human somatostatin (Itakura et al., 1977). This is due to its easy implementation, low cost, high yields that can be obtained and a plethora of genetic tools that are available. Despite the advances achieved in the recombinant protein field, many targets cannot be expressed in a soluble and homogeneous state, requiring the evaluation of several parameters including different solubility enhancer proteins, promoters, E. coli strains, among others (Correa andOppezzo, 2011, 2015). In addition, the requirement of post-translational modifications may impose restraints for the selection of the correct expression scheme. Several approaches have been developed to allow the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytosol of E. coli, although for some cases it may be worthwhile to direct the expression of the target protein to the periplasmic space, which contains a specialized enzymatic system for disulfide bond formation (Berkmen, 2012). In addition, the requirement of a specific glycosylation pattern for a particular target protein can make the expression in eukaryotic hosts mandatory. \n\nOther important issue to consider is the downstream process that can have an important effect in the quantities and quality of the final product. In this regard, several tags have been developed to facilitate the purification process. Despite the fact that the polyhistidine-tag (HisTag), has been extensively used for the purification of recombinant proteins (Walls and Loughran, 2011), protein targets that are poorly expressed in E. coli are usually eluted with contaminants derived from the host, requiring further purification steps and reducing final yields (Bolanos-Garcia and Davies, 2006;Magnusdottir et al., 2009). Moreover, it presented a relatively poor purification performance for extracts derived from yeast, Drosophila, and HeLa cells (Lichty et al., 2005).",

Most expression systems are based on an inducible promoter, and addition of the appropriate inducer leads to the production of the heterologous protein in most cases intracellularly. Microbial expression systems have been described for bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. All these systems have advantages and disadvantages, which have been extensively discussed [1][2][3]. \n\nEscherichia coli is the most widely used bacterial host to synthesize recombinant proteins for biochemical and functional studies. E. coli cells are easy to culture since they have a very short doubling time in rich media, and they are easy to manipulate genetically. Three disadvantages related to E. coli are: (1) low expression of some heterologous genes; (2) some heterologous proteins are insoluble and form inclusion bodies; and (3) contamination of the heterologous proteins by the endotoxin LPS [4,5]. \n\nBacillus subtilis is an attractive alternative host for heterologous protein production and engineering because of the following reasons: (1) it can secrete proteins efficiently, especially homologous proteins up to 20 g/l; \n\n(2) it is nonpathogenic; (3) and it has been granted the GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status by the American Food and Drug Administration [6][7][8]. The authors have developed several plasmid-based expression vectors exhibiting structural stability [9], where induction can be accomplished by addition of xylose [10], IPTG [11], glycine [12] or by a cold shock [13]. \n\nPromoter P spac is one of the most-popular promoters used for expression of heterologous proteins in B. subtilis, but it is rather weak [14]. The IPTG-inducible P grac promoter is 50 times stronger than P spac , and it has been derived from the B. subtilis groESL promoter and the E. coli lac operator [15,16].",

Because of its ability to rapidly grow in a high-density environment in a low-cost medium, its well-defined genetic traits, and the multiplicity of cloning vectors and mutant host strains, E. coli offers an efficient and cost-effective method for the rapid and high-yield production of proteins. The use of bacterial hosts in the context of producing recombinant toxins and fusion proteins necessitates either resistance to the toxin or the capability to facilitate the accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in organelles that spatially separate the produced toxin from its molecular target, potentially preventing unwanted cytotoxic effects within the host cell. This spatial separation can enhance the overall yield of the desired product. \n\nConcerning the production of RITs in Escherichia coli, the absence of N-linked glycosylation may lead to differences in the behavior of the expressed monoclonal antibodies compared to those produced in mammalian cells. This can include changes in antibody binding strength, serum persistence, and a possible immunogenic response. In bacteria, mAb-based RITs are incorrectly folded and assembled, necessitating costly multi-step refolding processes, which frequently begin with denatured inclusion bodies. \n\nIn summary, the choice of a prokaryotic host for toxins or RIT production involves considerations related to both resistance to the toxin and the cellular localization of the POI. These factors play a crucial role in optimizing the production and guaranteeing increased production of the recombinant immunotoxin.",

            "text": "Based on this approach, the binding residues of the anti-EpEX-scFv generated from the parental hybridoma MOC31 were grafted onto the scFv 4D5 framework leading to the formation of a high affinity and very stable 4D5MOC-B scFv [7]. Among different expression hosts, the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli (Escherichia coli) is preferred as the first choice for laboratory investigations to express recombinant proteins because of its simplicity and fast growth in low cost media as well as the availability of a large number of mutant host strains. However, insolubility is one of the main challenges that need to be overcome for improving the production of biologically active heterologous proteins in this host [8]. To circumvent the solubility problem, several strategies were previously considered including protein secretion to the periplasm of E. coli, using weak promoters or solubility-enhancing fusion tags, optimization of the cultivation conditions, and utilization of numerous genetically modified hosts [7]. Because of supplying extra copies of rare tRNAs, reducing endogenous proteases or facilitating disulfide bond formation, various commercially available engineered E. coli hosts have been able to promote the expression and solubility of a recombinant protein [9]. For example, the production of soluble TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) has been tested in different expression hosts including BL21 TM (DE3); BL21 TM (DE3)pLysS and Rosetta TM . Results showed that soluble TNF-\u03b1 yield was higher when BL21 TM (DE3)pLysS was used as an expression host. However, successful expression and solubility depend on recombinant protein expressed and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis [10], although 4D5MOC-B ScFv fragment was previously expressed in E. coli BL21\u2122 (DE3) (2) and E. coli Rosetta\u2122 (DE3) (3) strains.",

            "text": "This means glycosylation did not play a very vital role in keeping the activity of these enzymes. The expression of Endoxylanase in Lactobacillus and B. subtilis is usually higher compared to E. coli because they are Gram-positive and they perform N-glycosylation (Upreti et al., 2003). The advantages of using B. subtilis heterologous expression of recombinant protein include lack of pathogenicity and endotoxins, no appreciable codon usage bias, and inexpensive protein purification methods (Wang et al., 2019). Streptomyces lividans is also a Gram-positive bacteria found in the soil, that has been utilized for the synthesis of the recombinant enzyme. it can also be used for the synthesis of secondary metabolites (Binnie et al., 1997). The ability of Streptomyces to secret high concentration of recombinant protein and the ease for bacterial transformation makes it a suitable host for enzyme expression. Furthermore, it has a proven track record for expressing enzymes that have been used for the synthesis of pharmaceutical drugs (Ann\u00e9 et al., 2012;Kang and Kim, 2021). \n\nZymomonas mobilis is an ethanol-tolerant bacterium that ferments a wide variety of monosaccharides and produces bioethanol in significant quantities (Kurumbang et al., 2019). It possesses some unique properties that make it an excellent candidate to be considered as a substitute for yeast in the manufacturing of bioethanol (Li et al., 2019). Utilizing this bacterium as an expression platform for recombinant protein shows about 12-30 times higher protein expression when compared to E. coli (Kurumbang et al., 2019). Other advantages include: relatively simple gene transformation techniques, and the ability to express recombinant protein both intracellularly and extracellularly. Expression plasmids can be kept either as autonomous replication DNAs or integrated into the host genome (Ray and Behera, 2017).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most favorite hosts for protein heteroexpression. It is widely used in protein expression, due to its low cost, fast growth and high yield [13]. Although many proteins have been successfully expressed in E. coli, most of them were expressed as inactive inclusion bodies [13]. The purification of inclusion bodies is considered labor-intensive, time-consuming and not cost-effective [13]. The pET systems are very powerful for high efficient prokaryotic expression under the control of strong bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals. Vector pET32a (+) is one of the pET systems that permits target genes to be fused to trxA for high levels of expression with good solubility [14]. \n\nIn a previous study, we constructed a recombinant pET32a (+) plasmid to produce wild-type CtCVNH. The recombinant protein CtCVNH could be expressed in E. coli. Several E. coli rare codons were found in the coding sequence of CtCVNH, two of which were in tandem. In order to avoid translation errors caused by rare codons, E. coli strain Rosetta 2 (DE3), which could supply tRNAs recognizing rare codons, was used as the expression host for recombinant CtCVNH. However, two expression proteins were detected, corresponding to 34 kDa and 23 kDa, respectively, which could not be separated by affinity chromatography. The Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF) and bioinformatics analysis indicated that the 23 kDa protein was identical to the N-terminus part of the target protein. We inferred that the 23 kDa protein was a partial product resulting from premature termination [15,16]. \n\nIn order to obtain the single recombinant CtCVNH protein, the coding sequence of the CtCVNH protein was optimized. Codons that might affect protein expression were replaced with E. coli preferred codons. The protein of the optimized gene was expressed as described above. An obvious expression band about 31 kDa could be detected. More importantly, only a target protein was detected, which was purified through affinity chromatography.",

There are heterologous proteins such as xylanases which cannot be expressed in this host functionally due to repetitive appearance of rare codons in addition to disulfide bond formation (Stewart et al. 1998) and glycosylation like requirements for specific post translational modifications. E. coli can perform simple O-glycosylation only but xylanases require N-glycosylation (Messner 2009). Exceptionally, from a thermophilic fungus P. thermophila a glycosylated \u03b2-Xylosidase gene was functionally expressed in E. coli (Teng et al. 2011). The extracellular expression of this gene has indicated that glycosylation was not essential for its activity. From Klebsiella oxytoca a xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS) utilization operon encoding a xylosidase and xylobiose/cation symporter was expressed in E. coli KO11. This expression resulted in successful consumption of XOS having xylosyl up to six residues (Qian et al. 2003). Therefore, multiple factors including rapid growth on inexpensive media, simple practices of transformation and easy isolation and purification techniques have made E. coli a successful candidate of recombinant expression platform.",

Easily amenable to genetic manipulations, E. coli strain K-12 is among the most frequently used hosts for cloning and the intermediate and the final destination chassis for engineering large DNA fragments.\n\nEscherichia coli K-12 is also important for a number of industrial applications, biomanufacturing and metabolic engineering (Ajikumar et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2010;Clomburg and Gonzalez, 2011;Yim et al., 2011;Zhou et al., 2012). With the advent of synthetic biology, E. coli K-12 has become one of the most frequently used synthetic biology host organisms (Juhas et al., 2013;2014a;Juhas, 2015).\n\nIntroduction of the synthetic DNA fragments into the E. coli genome by chromosomal integration has many advantages over the plasmid-borne transformation (Cunningham et al., 2009;Marcellin et al., 2010). Furthermore, integration into the chromosome could be exploited for heterologous protein expression, particularly for expression of toxic proteins in E. coli. Work on plasmids has shown that regulation of expression is tighter when the copy number is low (Anthony et al., 2004;Guan et al., 2013). The frequently used methods of the E. coli chromosomal integration include the integrase-mediated recombination between the phage attachment sites (att) (St-Pierre et al., 2013) and the \u03bb bacteriophage Red recombinase-mediated recombination employing knockin/knock-out (KIKO) vectors (Sabri et al., 2013), plasmid pSB1K3(FRTK) (Juhas et al., 2014b) and the yeast mitochondrial homing endonuclease I-SceI (Ublinskaya et al., 2012).

            "text": "Recombinant protein production has become a routine practice in many laboratories from academic to industrial fields. Several hosts are available for protein production among them, Escherichia coli has been by far the most widely used. Some advantages of this host is the low cost, infrastructure of implementation, easy handling, high yield production, and an ever increasing set of tools and genetic information useful for the expression of challenging targets. Despite its importance and utility, recombinant proteins (RP) not always are produced in a soluble and homogeneous state. For these \"difficult to express\" proteins, several approaches have been developed in order to overcome the problems associated with insolubility. Some parameters that can affect protein expression are: induction temperature, promoter strength, use of specific E. coli strains, co-expression of molecular chaperones or biological partners and the use of different solubility enhancer or fusion proteins (Correa and Oppezzo, 2011). In the last decade, the advent of high-throughput screening methods have facilitated the evaluation of hundreds of conditions generated from the combination of the mentioned parameters in order to find one that gives a soluble protein (Vincentelli et al., 2011;Vincentelli and Romier, 2013). However, to exploit all these variables it is necessary to have a method for cloning the target gene in many different vectors in a fast and simple manner. Several techniques were recently generated to facilitate the cloning of target genes in a parallel way, in which the same insert can be introduced into different expression vectors simultaneously. Among these methods are the Gateway technology [Invitrogen, (Esposito et al., 2009)], In-Fusion technology, [Clontech, (Berrow et al., 2007)], Ligase Independent Cloning, (Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990), and Restriction Free Cloning, [RF cloning, (Unger et al., 2010)].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a very commonly used, robust and cost-effective expression system for largescale production of recombinant proteins. E. coli is genetically well characterized and is easy to handle and manipulate genetically. Its faster growth rate, inexpensive culture media, high expression levels and easy scale-up process provide major advantages for large-scale production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies [11]. E. coli was successfully used to manufacture recombinant human insulin in 1982 for treating diabetes patients. It is important to note that insulin is a heterodimer and entails oxidative protein folding to attain a functionally active 3D conformation. The success accomplished with high level expression of recombinant human insulin validated the significance of E. coli expression system for large-scale production of recombinant proteins. Besides human insulin, several recombinant proteins for therapeutic applications, including human growth hormone, interferon \u03b12a and \u03b12b, glucagon, urate oxidase, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and parathyroid hormone, have been successfully manufactured using E. coli expression system [12]. Although E. coli has been used extensively for expression of heterologous proteins, it is still not possible to determine the optimum production conditions for all the proteins. Expression conditions that are optimal for one protein may not be ideal for another protein. One of the major issues while producing heterologous proteins in E. coli is differences in codon usage between the two organisms. This difference in codon usage could cause errors in translation leading to low expression levels of recombinant proteins [13]. The other parameters that can affect the protein expression are choice of promoters, growth conditions and hydrophobicity of proteins.",

The challenge lies in not only expressing the protein of interest but also expressing it to a high level in its native conformation(s). Most membrane proteins are naturally expressed in low levels, and so obtaining sufficient amounts of the native membrane proteins to conduct functional and structural studies requires large amounts of resources and is really only realistic for proteins that are naturally abundant in certain cell types, such as rhodopsin in the retina. 1 To overcome the problem of low natural expression, recombinant overexpression can be performed, increasing the yield per cell. 2 Another advantage of recombinant expression is the ability to easily add tags to enable efficient separation of the target protein from the other membrane proteins. Common purification tags include histidine, strep, and flag tags, which can increase the purity and yield though affinity purification. 3 However, it is important that these tags do not interfere with the function of the protein. \n\nRecombinant membrane protein expression is also a means of producing more stable membrane proteins through the use of mutagenesis and protein engineering, but the native conformation will be altered and therefore the correct function and structure will not be discovered. 4 ffective recombinant membrane protein expression requires finding a suitable host. If the membrane protein is a prokaryotic protein, then Escherichia coli could potentially be used. The advantages of using E. coli for recombinant overexpression of membrane proteins is that it can be carried out quickly, as E. coli have a high growth rate, high quantities of cells are easily achieved, and it is cost-effective. 5 If the target protein is eukaryotic, such as human membrane proteins, a eukaryotic host such as yeast, insect, or mammalian cells can be used. \n\nInsect cell expression is a commonly used expression system for recombinant mammalian membrane proteins. It requires the production of a recombinant baculovirus carrying the gene of interest, and infection of insect cells, such as Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9), with this virus leads to protein expression. 6 Inclusion bodies are rarely formed with the baculovirus expression system in insect cells, unlike in E. coli. 7",

The transient gene expression approach is commonly used to shortly produce large amounts of protein for the biochemical studies of the drug and to perform preclinical investigations [17,18]. Expi 293 cell is a HEK293 cell-derived class for culture in high cell density suspension and serum-free culture medium. The chemically defined form of these properties makes this cell suitable for industrial production [19]. \n\nThe mammalian cell expression system is currently the most common method of producing this antibody; however, Escherichia coli has the potential to produce proteins without a glycosylation pattern, as well as the ease of ordering the production process and the cost-effectiveness of the bacterial culture raw materials has made this host a suitable host for the production of Fc-free antibodies and dualspecific antibodies [20]. Accordingly, a significant portion of therapeutic proteins without glycosylation pattern is produced in this host, and BL21 (DE3) is among the most common industrial and research strains. The long history of industrial use of E. coli, as well as the appropriate rules of the drug production supervisory departments to this host, are significant advantages of this production platform [21]. \n\nConsidering the single-chain and non-glycosylation of Blinatombe, the capacity of the bacterial expression system to produce this antibody was used; we compared it with the antibody produced in eukaryotic cells. This is because no such comparison has been made for the Blinatomb antibody. The great advantages of E. coli, as a suitable host include its industrial production parameters; the availability of inexpensive culture media for the production of biopharmaceuticals in this host; the expression of monoclonal antibodies of two BiTE family traits (due to no post-translational changes). The commercial manufacturer expressed Blinatomomb in the host of CHO. This study aimed to examine the expression and binding properties of antibodies expressed in both systems and compare them.",

E. coli is generally the first organism of choice for production of prokaryotic proteins, but many eukaryotic proteins can be produced successfully in E. coli as well. However, compared to eukaryotic systems, E. coli cannot provide most of the post-translational modifications (notably glycosylation) and often fails in folding complex proteins, such as those containing multiple disulfide bonds, eukaryotic membrane proteins, or large multi-domain assemblies and multi-subunit complexes. 14  E. coli, proteins can be produced intracellularly in the cytoplasm, directed into the periplasm, or secreted to the extracellular milieu. The cytoplasm is a reducing environment, whereas the periplasm is an oxidizing environment that allows the formation of disulfide bonds and also has lower proteolytic activity. However, directing produced proteins into the periplasm often results in a lower yield than cytosolic production and usually not all expressed protein will be secreted into the periplasm. To direct a recombinant protein to the periplasm, one needs to add a periplasmic signal sequence (such as phoA, pelB, ompA, ompT, dsbA, torA) to the N-terminus of the protein, which will be removed after crossing the inner membrane. Proteins can be secreted either post-translationally (Sec mechanism) or co-translationally (SPR mechanism). 15 large collection of E. coli expression vectors is widely available, either commercially or via institutional or non-profit plasmid repositories (see supplemental information, ''biological resources''). Such expression vectors contain a set of genetic elements (e.g., promoter, terminator, origin of replication, antibiotic resistance cassette, etc.) that allow a regulated expression of the coding sequence of the protein(s) of interest (see supplemental information, ''expression vectors and strains'').",

            "text": "Membrane proteins are important drug targets and play key roles in many different cellular processes, bringing them into the focus of many research projects investigating their structure and function. The production and purification of sufficient quantities of the protein of interest in a properly folded state is a crucial prerequisite for structural and functional studies underlining the importance of a suitable production system. Due to its easy handling, relatively low cost and the accessibility of a variety of expression vectors and strains E. coli is by far the most commonly used prokaryotic host for recombinant membrane protein production. Great efforts have been made to improve the success with E. coli systems, however, production of many membrane proteins in sufficient yields still frequently fail. Therefore, alternative prokaryotic hosts have been tested for their applicability for membrane protein production but only very few have been found to be successful in a similar extent as E. coli. Among them, the most widely spread are the Gram-positive bacteria L. lactis and B. subtilis [40,41]. Both organisms are comparable to E. coli with respect to growth rate and cultivation conditions but differ in membrane architecture and at least in parts in the composition of their membrane protein folding and insertion machinery [2,14]. \n\nPreviously, Surade et al. compared the production of 37 secondary active transporters in E. coli and L. lactis and found the latter to be a less suitable host for the production of this set of proteins [35]. It was mentioned elsewhere [15] that the better performance of E. coli might be explained by the selection of proteins mostly derived from Gram-negative sources. Following this line of argument Gram-positive hosts cannot be considered as convincing alternatives to E. coli, at least for the production of proteins derived from Gram-negative sources. \n\nA few Gram-negative organisms have been examined for the production of recombinant proteins. In particular, a P. fluorescens based expression system has been developed [42] and commercialized (http://www.pfenex. com). Pseudomonas fluorescens can be cultivated to high cell densities in bioreactors and this expression platform has been extensively employed for the high-yield production of soluble and/or secreted pharmaceutical proteins.",

The growth disadvantage favors faster\u2010growing non\u2010producer mutants. Therefore, continuous bioprocessing is hardly feasible in Escherichia coli due to the high escape rate. The stability of E. coli expression systems under long\u2010term production conditions and how metabolic load triggered by recombinant gene expression influences the characteristics of mutations are investigated. Iterated fed\u2010batch\u2010like microbioreactor cultivations are conducted under production conditions. The easy\u2010to\u2010produce green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a challenging antigen\u2010binding fragment (Fab) are used as model proteins, and BL21(DE3) and BL21Q strains as expression hosts.

The host RNA polymerase\u2010based BL21Q expression system remains stable in the production of GFP in long\u2010term cultivations. For the production of Fab, mutations in lacI of the BL21Q derivatives have positive effects on long\u2010term stability.

In most cases, especially when high levels of target proteins are required, plasmid-borne expression is the method of choice for this purpose. The availability of a plethora of E. coli plasmid expression vectors with various promoters, selection markers, purification tags, fusion partners and auxiliary proteins has greatly simplified the process of cloning and expression in this microorganism. However, there are certain situations where integrating the gene of interest into the chromosome of the host may be advantageous over plasmid-based systems. For example, when the function of the target gene needs to be evaluated under physiological conditions, variations in plasmid copy number and, consequently, expression levels can affect the results and may complicate the interpretation of the obtained data (1, 2). Similarly, in metabolic engineering where expression stability is considered of primary importance chromosomal integration offers certain advantages (3). Even in cases when E. coli is being used simply as a host to obtain high levels of heterologous recombinant proteins for in vitro analyses, chromosomal integration of the corresponding gene under the control of a strong exogenous promoter may be used as a reliable alternative to plasmid-borne protein expression (4). Several methods for the integration of the gene of interest in the genome of E. coli are available and both the site-specific and homologous recombination pathways have been exploited for this purpose. Methods based on site-specific recombination include the FLP/FRT, Cre/loxP and Int/att systems (2, 5, 6). In most cases, the enzymatic activity required for these processes are provided on helper plasmids. The gene of interest is inserted into an integrative plasmid containing the corresponding recognition sequence and a selectable marker and transformed into a host carrying the required enzymatic function. These systems can be used to integrate very large constructs. However, insertion can only occur in a limited number of pre-existing recognition sequences in the host genome (7). Methods based on homologous recombination, on the other hand, can be used to integrate the target",

            "text": "Heterologous gene expression is a widely used and vital biotechnology in basic and applied biology research fields. In particular, this technology (bioengineering ) is emerging as a useful tool in fields of applied biology, such as medical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural sciences including food science. With this technology, animals, fishes, plants, and eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms can be used as host organisms for transformation, and various types of vectors have been developed and have become commercially available. It is only about 40 years since a heterologous cloned DNA was expressed in Escherichia coli cells (Annie et al., 1974;Old & Primrose, 1989). Development of various types of gene transfer systems has assisted the widespread use of gene engineering technologies in all research fields.\n\nThe production of high-value compounds is a requisite purpose of gene engineering for all the fields of applied biology. Such production can occur in two ways: host cells are used to produce a product that is new to them by expressing a foreign gene(s); or host cells are enhanced to produce higher levels of the target product(s), which can be also inherently synthesized at normal levels by host organisms. The examples of the former are the production of insulin (Goeddel et al., 1979) or \u03b1-fetprotein (Nishi et al., 1988) by E. coli cells that were transformed with genes encoding these proteins. The literature on the latter means of production has accumulated rapidly. In such cases, two or more kinds of foreign gene carried in one or more vectors was used to transform the host organisms, by which a highvalue compound(s) can be generated as the new product in the transformed host organisms or can enhance the metabolic activities of the host organisms. Yumoto et al. (1998) isolated a bacterium with a remarkably high catalase activity from a waste pool at a fish-processing factory in Hokkaido, Japan. This bacterium was identified as Vibrio rumoiensis strain S-1 T (strain S-1 hereafter; Yumoto et al., 1999). Details of this www.intechopen.com Innovations in Biotechnology 252 bacterium and its catalase protein (VktA) and gene (vktA) are described in the following section (",

            "text": "Multiple protein expression systems are available for the production of recombinant proteins, e.g., bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. However, Escherichia coli is the host system widely used in the production of the rec PrP due to multiple significant benefits over other expression systems including a well-established protein overexpression protocol, low costs, ease of use, and scale (Terpe 2006). A vast number of Escherichia coli strains as well as plasmid vectors with a variety of choices of promoters, affinity tags, and antibiotic resistance are commercially available with the purpose to confer the best results of transformation in the Escherichia coli and an ultimate yield in protein expression. Due to the intrinsic affinity of the PrP C for metals, the additional His-tag sequence is not needed as fusion to PrP to obtain a simple and faster protein purification (Csire et al. 2020;Jackson et al. 2001;Schmitz et al. 2016a). PrP expression in Escherichia coli can be achieved overnight by using autoinduction media or by IPTG protocols (Fig. 1). Commercial or homemade auto-induction media have preferentially been used for the expression of recombinant proteins due to being convenient since the bacterial growth does not need to be measured and due to a higher yield of protein (several-fold higher than conventional IPTG induction systems) (Grabski et al. 2005;Studier 2005). The majority of rec PrP is localized in the inclusion bodies. The isolation of these inclusion bodies can be achieved by a purification protocol for inclusion bodies (Palmer and Wingfield 2004) or with the use of BugBuster Master Mix buffer, which so far is the most effective and fastest method (Fig. 1) (Bourkas et al. 2019). It allows a maximal recovery of functional proteins from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. After purification, inclusion bodies are denatured (by guanidine or urea buffer) with the purpose to release the overexpressed proteins in the supernatant.",

Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacterium belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, owing their name to their discoverer, an Austrian pediatrician and bacteriologist Theodor Escherich. At present, among bacterial systems it is one of the most extensively applied systems for the production of heterologous proteins. Escherichia coli is a model organism in today's experiments in genetic and metabolic engineering. It constitutes the best known and the cheapest system to test new gene constructs and in attempts at production of proteins and enzymes in bench scale and commercial scale systems. Its application in commercial projects is undisputable. Obviously, the most significant advantages of bacteria E. coli include a high degree of genome characterization (defined transcription and translation systems), availability of a broad spectrum of vectors and strains, as well as capacity of rapid growth on cheap culture media (successive generations are produced very fast) using at the same time simple selection factors, mainly antibiotics. Escherichia coli is a non-pathogenic species, for which culture methods are already well-established. Human albumin, growth hormones as well as enzymes extensively used in molecular biology are successfully produced in E. coli cells. Potential applicability of the above mentioned properties of this host facilitates modification, use of genetic engineering methods, glycerol metabolism in E. coli cells leading to the acquisition of capacity to produce 1,3-PDO.",

However, about 50% of recombinant proteins fail to be expressed in a variety of host cells. Here we show that the accessibility of translation initiation sites modelled using the mRNA base-unpairing across the Boltzmann\u2019s ensemble significantly outperforms alternative features. This approach accurately predicts the successes or failures of expression experiments, which utilised Escherichia coli cells to express 11,430 recombinant proteins from over 189 diverse species. On this basis, we develop TIsigner that uses simulated annealing to modify up to the first nine codons of mRNAs with synonymous substitutions. We show that accessibility captures the key propensity beyond the target region (initiation sites in this case), as a modest number of synonymous changes is sufficient to tune the recombinant protein expression levels. We build a stochastic simulation model and show that higher accessibility leads to higher protein production and slower cell growth, supporting the idea of protein cost, where cell growth is constrained by protein circuits during overexpression.",

            "text": "Background The widespread usage of protein expression systems in Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) is a workhorse of molecular biology research that has practical applications in biotechnology industry, including the production of pharmaceutical drugs. Various factors can strongly affect the successful construction and stable maintenance of clones and the resulting biosynthesis levels. These include an appropriate selection of recombinant hosts, expression systems, regulation of promoters, the repression level at an uninduced state, growth temperature, codon usage, codon context, mRNA secondary structure, translation kinetics, the presence/absence of chaperons and others. However, optimization of the growth medium\u2019s composition is often overlooked. We systematically evaluate this factor, which can have a dramatic effect on the expression of recombinant proteins, especially those which are toxic to a recombinant host. Results Commonly used animal tissue- and plant-based media were evaluated using a series of clones in pET vector, containing expressed Open Reading Frames (ORFs) with a wide spectrum of toxicity to the recombinant E. coli : (i) gfpuv (nontoxic); (ii) tp84_28\u2014which codes for thermophilic endolysin (moderately toxic); and (iii) tthHB27IRM \u2014which codes for thermophilic restriction endonuclease-methyltransferase (REase-MTase)\u2014RM.TthHB27I (very toxic). The use of plant-derived peptones (soy peptone and malt extract) in a culture medium causes the T7-lac expression system to leak. We show that the presence of raffinose and stachyose (galactoside derivatives) in those peptones causes premature and uncontrolled induction of gene expression, which affects the course of the culture, the stability of clones and biosynthesis levels. Conclusions The use of plant-derived peptones in a culture medium when using T7-lac hybrid promoter expression systems, such as Tabor-Studier, can lead to uncontrolled production of a recombinant protein. These conclusions also extend to other, lac operator-controlled promoters. In the case of proteins which are toxic to a recombinant host, this",

E. coli grow rapidly in culture and can achieve high-density growth in a short period of time using inexpensive media that is suitable for continuous fermentation. The yield of recombinant protein per unit volume tends to be relatively high, and can represent up to 30% of the secreted protein. Recombinant lipase expressed in E. coli can be located in the cytoplasm or secreted to the extracellular environment; it can exist in the form of inclusion bodies or expressed as a fusion protein with a FLAG epitope tag or fluorescent protein in order to avoid intracellular degradation and to simplify the subsequent separation and purification processes (Yin et al., 2007). \n\nHowever, heterologous expression in E. coli is associated with the following disadvantages: (1) when eukaryotic proteins, especially heterologous proteins containing disulfide bonds, are expressed in E. coli, inactive cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be formed due to improper protein folding; (2) Heterologous proteins that are not secreted often do not undergo proper folding and post-translational modification; this can lead to inactivation and degradation of heterologous proteins by the host; (3) the recombinant protein of interest needs to be separated from many background E. coli proteins, resulting in the need for complex separation and purification steps; (4) the E. coli expression systems involves contamination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which is a proinflammatory molecule in mammalian hosts that plays a key role in host-pathogen interaction with the innate immune system. Other commonly used prokaryotic expression systems include those based in B. subtilis, Ralstonia eutropha, and Pseudomonas spp. Compared with the E. coli expression system, the B. subtilis system facilitates recombinant protein secretion, and has no Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide components; as such, this system is suitable for large-scale highdensity fermentation.",

            "text": "Its adapted strain offered positive possibilities for energy production and for improving synthetic yields. \n\nIn E. coli biosynthesis, two general problems lies in its inability of properly investing nutrition and energy for its survival and target production [5]. First, the target protein encoded by expression vector in Escherichia coli poses metabolic burden under strong induction upon regulated promoters, as over-activated recombinant genes may produce aggregates of protein products, thus leading to the toxicity to the host and simultaneously the growth challenges derived from vector itself including retaining resistance gene and DNA production, which are factors to be considered in the cultivation [6]. Second, the downsides of overfeeding nutrition loom as several critical growth challenges have been elucidated in some studies [7], including its limited glucose turnover rate Fig. 1 Diagram of the proposed model for GR-GFP in E. coli BL21 (DE3). In the chemiosmotic coupling of E. coli, we hypothesized that the expression of Gloeobacter rhodopsin on the inner membrane could act as an additional source of proton gradient driven by light, thus promoting the proton motive force of ATP synthase. Also, the green fluorescence protein (GFP) was designed as a reporter gene for proper expression and folding of the fusion protein GF-GFP and its impact on transcription regulators, which deteriorates the integrity of its gene-harboring subpopulation in the fed-batch [8]. The use of rhodopsin as a strategy to address the problems focuses on providing additional energy to improve its glucose turnover rate in host and thus more bacterial precursors in compound synthesis. Previous studies of expressing rhodopsin have proved potential for improving the growth of the cell and the enhancement of product [9,10]. We hypothesized that additional energy provided by rhodopsin expression in the cell host could prevent protein aggregate [11] and promote cell growth.",

Protein expression was optimized according to a recent reference with minor modification (Liu et al., 2009). Briefly, the E. coli harboring pET-GP5ab was cultured in LB liquid medium at 37 \u2022 C with shaking until the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.6. Then, isopropyl \u2424-dthiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 or 1 mM to induce expression at 37 \u2022 C for 7 h. The empty vector transformed bacteria were used as control. The bacteria were pelleted at 10,000 rpm, at 4 \u2022 C for 10 min and re-suspended in TE buffer (50 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Then, they were digested with lysozyme at a final concentration of 100 g/L at room temperature for 30 min. The cell suspension was sonicated on ice for 30 min. Then the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C. The supernatant and the pellets were mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-loading buffer, respectively. Both samples were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

            "text": "E. coli remains the most widely used system for recombinant protein expression due to its numerous advantages over other expression systems such as yeast, baculovirus, mammalian cells, and cell-free systems. The key benefits of using E. coli include its low cost, ease of use, and ability to scale production efficiently, making it the preferred host for many researchers. [14] urthermore, the flexibility of E. coli in accommodating various expression conditions allows for fine-tuning protein production to optimize yield and solubility, which are critical for downstream applications. Recent studies have demonstrated that altering expression parameters, such as temperature, induction time, and inducer concentration, can significantly enhance production efficiency and solubility of target proteins. [15] ur comprehensive search on the database, which catalogued E. coli-expressed recombinant proteins, included entries corresponding to 17 317 unique UniProt IDs sourced from 19 799 research articles. This extensive dataset provides valuable insight into the commonly used induction conditions across a wide array of proteins. For instance, in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), we show that the most frequently used induction temperatures are 18, 20, and 16 \u00b0C, which accounted for 19.1%, 15.6%, and 13.6% of cases, respectively. The induction times are clustered predominantly around two ranges: 12-16 h (69.0%) and 3-6 h (14.3%), with isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) concentrations commonly set to 1 millimolar or 0.5 millimolar. Additionally, as shown in Figure 5, specific conditions are favored to maximize the expression of proteins with distinct annotations. For example, proteins associated with \"disulfide bond,\" \"protease\", and \"DNA-binding\" annotations tend to be expressed under shorter induction times (2-8 h) and higher temperatures (28-37 \u00b0C), whereas those related to the \"cytoskeleton\", \"cell cycle\", and \"nucleus\" are less commonly expressed under shorter induction times. Moreover, proteins that bind iron or whose functions are iron-dependent are more frequently expressed at 28 \u00b0C for 24 h.",

The enzyme production rate and yield are the main factors to consider when choosing the appropriate expression system for the production of recombinant proteins. Recombinant enzymes have been expressed in bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Bacillus and lactic acid bacteria), filamentous fungi (e.g., Aspergillus) and yeasts (e.g., Pichia pastoris). The favorable and very advantageous characteristics of these species have resulted in an increasing number of biotechnological applications. Bacterial hosts (e.g., E. coli) can be used to quickly and easily overexpress recombinant enzymes; however, bacterial systems cannot express very large proteins and proteins that require post-translational modifications. The main bacterial expression hosts, with the exception of lactic acid bacteria and filamentous fungi, can produce several toxins which are not compatible with the expression of recombinant enzymes in food and drugs. However, due to the multiplicity of the physiological impacts arising from high-level expression of genes encoding the enzymes and expression hosts, the goal of overproduction can hardly be achieved, and therefore, the yield of recombinant enzymes is limited. In this review, the recent strategies used for the high-level expression of microbial enzymes in the hosts mentioned above are summarized and the prospects are also discussed. We hope this review will contribute to the development of the enzyme-related research field.",

            "text": ". Due to the fact that endotoxin removal techniques belong to the most difficult tasks in downstream processes during protein purification, the establishment of a gram-positive endotoxin-free expression system for S-layer/allergen fusion proteins was required.\n\nThe choice of an appropriate host and suitable production conditions is crucial for the downstream processing of a pharmaceutical-grade product [19]. In contrast to the gram-negative E. coli, B. subtilis is considered as a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) organism [20]. The reason for the usage of B. subtilis as cell factory for the production of proteins with biotechnological application potential, are a) its ability to secrete functional extracellular proteins directly to the culture medium and b) the accumulation of information concerning its transcription and translation mechanisms, genetic manipulation and large scale fermentation which has been acquired during the last years [21]. A further advantage for expression of recombinant S-layer/allergen fusion proteins can be seen in the fact that B. subtilis strains carry no S-layer on their cell surface.\n\nIn the present study, the strain B. subtilis 1012, a nonpathogenic organism with naturally high secretory capacity was used as host for expression of the recombinant S-layer/allergen fusion protein rSbpA/Bet v1. E. coli -B. subtilis shuttle vectors pHT01, for intracellular expression, and pHT43, carrying the coding region for the signal peptide of the amyQ gene encoding a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens \u03b1-amylase fused to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence for extracelluar expression, were chosen.",

            "text": "Despite an increasing availability of expression systems which can be genetically manipulated [1], Escherichia coli is still the preferred prokaryotic host organism for recombinant protein production [2,3]. Mainly due to a high gene dosage effect, plasmid-based expression is commonly applied [1]. A prevalent system for heterologous gene expression in E. coli is based on the T7 RNA polymerase under control of the lac UV5 promoter [4]. For inducing recombinant protein production, autoinduction is often preferred over conventional IPTG induction. Advantages are the lower costs and the higher biocompatibility of the inducing compound lactose [2]. Furthermore, autoinduction does not require manual inducer addition since it is controlled by the host's metabolism. Thus, cell growth and subsequent protein formation are automatically separated from each other [5]. Autoinduction media were developed by Studier [6] and contain a carbon source mixture of glucose, glycerol, and lactose. During consumption of the preferred carbon source glucose, protein formation is suppressed [7]. After glucose depletion, lactose and glycerol are taken up more or less simultaneously. Whereas lactose is partially converted into allolactose [8][9][10], the physiological inducer of the lac operon [5], glycerol is consumed as energy source. Due to their defined chemical composition [11] mineral autoinduction media allow a detailed understanding of metabolic processes during induction and protein production.\n\nA major issue during recombinant protein production is the metabolic burden: the exhaustion of energy and biomass precursors as amino acids or nucleotides from host cell metabolism for synthesizing recombinant material [12][13][14][15]. Besides the production of plasmid-encoded proteins, also the plasmids themselves impose a metabolic load on the host cell since cellular resources are required for plasmid replication [1,[16][17][18]. Furthermore, the different frequency of synonymous codons in foreign coding DNA and host, namely codon bias, can massively affect heterologous protein production levels [19] and E. coli",

            "text": "The advent of recombinant DNA technology has widened the research arena for biologists. The manipulation of Escherichia coli provided the first expression system (Itakura et al. 1977) for therapeutic proteins, pioneering the production of recombinant proteins. The subsequent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (Human insulin receives FDA approval 1982), of an E. coli-based insulin (Goeddel et al. 1979) confirmed the utility of recombinant therapeutic protein production. As a prokaryote, E. coli cannot accurately express complex eukaryotic protein because almost all eukaryotic proteins are modified post-translationally and require the appropriate machinery to impart the characteristic structural features that are essential for their functional integrity. Resolution of this problem has led to the development of other expression systems, including the yeast system, the Baculovirus system, the mammalian cell system, and the plant expression system. Each type of expression system has been used extensively for the production of recombinant therapeutic compounds, with varying success, because no single system is universally appropriate for all tasks. However, plant expression systems excel in the production of plant-derived edible vaccines (Goeddel et al. 1979;Mishra et al. 2008;Yang and Yang 2010) and have tremendous growth potential as the basis of the modern discipline, providing immediate cures for infectious diseases. Simultaneous expression of multigenes reviewed by (Zorrilla-Lopez et al. 2013) into plants can alter complex metabolic pathways that can be used to produce compounds of pharmaceutics. \n\nThe transfer of foreign DNA from diverse organisms and its integration into a host genome form the backbone of recombinant DNA technology. However, the expression of a foreign gene in a host plant cell is dependent on the cumulative effects of several elements essential for cell transformation (coding sequence, promoter region, transcript termination, etc.), the plant cell pH, the efficiency and accuracy of the transcriptional and translational machinery, plant cell biochemistry, the availability of the amino acids required for the recombinant protein, the interaction between and storage of the expressed proteins in the plant cellular environment, and many other predictable and unknown factors.",

            "text": "Recently, large-scale analyses of recombinant protein expression have revealed sequence features for codon optimization in unprecedented detail 9,10 . In these studies, the recombinant protein expression of thousands of genes is evaluated in a systematic way using the same host organism and the same plasmid vector. Then, the influence of various sequence features on protein expression levels is investigated by statistical analyses. This strategy has provided new insights into conventionally-used sequence features such as the effect of the codon frequency depending on sequence positions (e.g. 5\u2032 regions or others). In addition, a variety of new sequence features have been shown to be important including the use of specific di-codons and the repeated occurrence of codons in neighboring positions. However, such studies have been so far limited to common host organisms such as Escherichia coli, presenting a question whether these sequence features are also effective for codon optimization in less-studied host organisms. \n\nRhodococcus erythropolis, a gram-positive GC-rich actinobacterium, has been used as a host organism for recombinant protein expression and for the heterologous production of antimicrobial compounds [11][12][13][14][15] . R. erythropolis grows and produces recombinant proteins at a wide temperature range from 4 to 35 \u00b0C, and has different intracellular milieu compared to other host organisms such as E. coli (a gram-negative bacterium) and Bacillus and Lactococcus species (gram-positive bacteria with moderate GC contents). Due to these characteristics, R. erythropolis can produce recombinant proteins that are difficult to be expressed in E. coli. R. erythropolis has also been shown to produce the bacterial lipoglycoproteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which cannot be expressed in E. coli for their post-translational modifications 16 . Based upon these performances, R. erythropolis is recognized as an alternative next-generation host microorganism.",

Another advantage is their cost-effectiveness, reflected in reduced processing time, water, and energy consumption. Although Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus , and Streptomyces spp. are successfully used for production of industrially relevant enzymes, they still lag far behind Escherichia coli as hosts for recombinant protein production. Generally, proteins secreted by Bacillus and Streptomyces hosts are released into the culture medium; their native conformation is preserved and easier recovery process enabled. Given the resilience of both hosts in harsh environmental conditions and their spore-forming capability, a deeper understanding and broader use of Bacillus and Streptomyces as expression hosts could significantly enhance the robustness of industrial bioprocesses. This mini-review aims to compare two expression hosts, emphasizing their specific advantages in industrial surroundings such are chemical, detergent, textile, food, animal feed, leather, and paper industries. The homologous sources, heterologous hosts, and molecular tools used for the production of recombinant proteins in these hosts are discussed. The potential to use both hosts as biocatalysts is also evaluated. Undoubtedly, Bacillus and Streptomyces spp. as production hosts possess the potential to take on a more substantial role, providing superior (bio-based) process robustness and flexibility.

            "text": "E. coli is among the extensively applied host for the expression of the protein [43,44] owing to its rapid expression and growth, easy cultivation, and elevated titers [45]. Moreover, its genetics are well elucidated in comparison with other microorganisms. Notwithstanding appreciable merits, the use of E. coli is associated with certain drawbacks, which can probably affect the production efficacy of recombinant proteins. For example, a higher cell density may produce a large amount of acetate harmful to cells. It is also not capable of producing very large proteins. In addition, issues related to difficulties in protein production, disulfide bonds, and refolding ability have also been observed in the E. coli system. Failure to synthesize recombinant protein because of the lack of glycosylation is another problem [46]. The modified production in mold, insect, yeast, or mammalian cells presents higher advantages for achieving glycosylation to attain a properly folded and stable protein. Over the years, other bacterial systems are also emerged for producing recombinant proteins, like engineered Lactococcus lactis as a good cell factory for expressing membrane protein [47]. They exhibit benefits over E. coli in terms of being endotoxin-free and GRAS [48]. Pseudomonas species, including P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. fluorescens were also considered preferred substitutes for E. coli expression systems to achieve a high titer of recombinant proteins. Laffitte et al. [18] cloned thaumatin II gene into E. coli K12, but the yield of protein was very low. A synthetic gene encoding thaumatin II was effectively expressed in E. coli [49]. Saraiva et al. [15] replicated the same system, resulting in about 40 mg of pure thaumatin that showed a comparable sweetness threshold value from the natural source.",

These methods have advantages and disadvantages depending on the type of protein to be expressed 8 . For example, the E. coli heterologous expression of glycosylated macromolecules or high disulphide content proteins has the disadvantage that often the recombinant proteins are produced as insoluble or non-functional molecules 8 . In this case, it is preferable to switch to a different expression system, such as Pichia pastoris, baculovirus/insect cell system or baculovirus variants that promote greater protein secretion as well as post-translational modifications typical of eukaryotic cells 5 . However, these expression systems are very expensive with respect to the E. coli system, which is still the preferred host for the heterologous expression of recombinant proteins due to cost considerations, speed, ease of use and genetic manipulation 1 . For this reason, in commerce, it is possible to find E. coli strains capable of overcoming the problems of inefficient disulphide bond formation or engineered E. coli cells to perform protein N-glycosylation, even though the efficiency is generally very low 9 . Consequently, many attempts were made to efficiently produce a recombinant protein in E. coli, which remains the most common expression host 1,9 . In this context, a system has been developed for anchoring heterologous proteins or polypeptides on the outer surface membrane of E. coli using the ice nucleation protein (INP) of the Gram-negative bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae 10 . INP is an outer membrane protein capable of imparting ice crystal formation on the supercooled water, with a deduced molecular weight of 118 kDa 10 .",

            "text": "With increasing demand for pharmaceutical proteins nowadays, more and more people are devoted to development of efficient biomanufacturing processes for proteins. Escherichia coli (E. coli), as one of the most commonly used host bacteria to express recombinant proteins, has many advantages. For example, high cell density cultures are easily achieved (Lee, 1996), transformation with exogenous genes is fast (Pope and Kent, 1996), and its use as a cell factory is well-established (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). However, commercial production of recombinant proteins by E. coli has remained a challenge. One of the most important problems is that E. coli has a poor ability to secrete proteins, which causes formation of inclusion bodies, low production titers, and complicated downstream purification procedures (Kim et al., 2015). To improve protein secretion efficiency in E. coli, some common strategies have been developed, such as selection of efficient signal peptides like the signal sequences from OmpA (Sun et al., 2019) and PelB (Mohajeri et al., 2016) that usually target proteins to the secretion machinery efficiently. Modification of key transporter proteins or auxiliary proteins involved in transmembrane transport also has been applied to increase the efficiency of protein secretion (Low et al., 2010). In addition, fusion of some peptide tags or proteins, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), also have proved to increase protein expression and extracellular secretion. Other strategies to improve protein secretion include fermentation process parameters control and medium optimization, such as addition of surfactants, osmolytes, metal ions, and glycine to the medium. \n\nRecombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF), a potential therapeutic protein that has been widely used as a healing agent for various chronic wounds, was successfully produced extracellularly in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pectate lyase B (PelB) signal peptide (Sriwidodo et al., 2019).",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production for medical, academic, or industrial applications is essential for our current life. Recombinant proteins are obtained mainly through microbial fermentation, with Escherichia coli being the host most used. In spite of that, some problems are associated with the production of recombinant proteins in E. coli, such as the formation of inclusion bodies, the metabolic burden, or the inefficient translocation/transport system of expressed proteins. Optimizing transcription of heterologous genes is essential to avoid these drawbacks and develop competitive biotechnological processes. Here, expression of YFP reporter protein is evaluated under the control of four promoters of different strength (PT7lac, Ptrc, Ptac, and PBAD) and two different replication origins (high copy number pMB1\u2032 and low copy number p15A). In addition, the study has been carried out with the E. coli BL21 wt and the ackA mutant strain growing in a rich medium with glucose or glycerol as carbon sources. Results showed that metabolic burden associated with transcription and translation of foreign genes involves a decrease in recombinant protein expression. It is necessary to find a balance between plasmid copy number and promoter strength to maximize soluble recombinant protein expression. The results obtained represent an important advance on the most suitable expression system to improve both the quantity and quality of recombinant proteins in bioproduction engineering.",

            "text": "B acterial expression system has been used for research and commercial based production of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. Bacterial strain, E. coli has been used to produce biopharmaceutical products such as insulin, interferon, human growth factors and other recombinant proteins (Tripathi, 2016). Bacterial strain E. coli offers different advantages, such as easy to grow, high growth rate and cheap media demands. Moreover, its cellular components and genetics are well studied, which make it a host, that can bear fruitful genetic manipulations for expression of recombinant proteins (Joseph et al., 2015;Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;Sivashanmugam et al., 2009;Tripathi, 2016). However, in spite of all these advantages, protein production in bacterial expression system, has never been a straight forward method. Certain disadvantages such as lack of post-translational modifications, formation of inclusion bodies, protein toxicity etc. may result in production of proteins either with improper structure and function or with no or very low yield (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Different methodologies have been developed to target those factors that might be responsible for the problem of low yield in bacterial expression system. Briefly, these methodologies can be broadly classified as (i) those dealing with optimization of bioprocessing and culture conditions and (ii) those that deal at molecular level for enhancement of protein production, such as strain engineering, increased plasmid number, codon optimization and genetic manipulations of certain genetic elements. \n\nOptimization of bioprocessing and culturing conditions include several strategies. For enhanced production of recombinant proteins, usually cultures with high cell densities are preferred in batch and fed-batch fermentation processes. Cultures can either be induced or grown in auto-induction media for enhanced production of recombinant proteins in a regulated way (Sivashanmugam et al., 2009). Different media compositions, have been studied and shown to affect the protein expression level.",

            "text": "E. coli is a typical prokaryotic expression system and one of the most attractive heterologous protein producer. The expression of proteins in this system is the easiest, quickest and cheapest. To date reformed E. coli is the extensively used cellular host for foreign protein expression because of its rapid growth rate which is as short as 20-30 minutes (Snustad and Simmons, 2010), capacity for continuous fermentation and relatively low cost. There are many commercial and non-commercial expression vectors available with different N and C terminal tags and many different strains are being optimized for special applications. \n\nThere are also problems related to the use of E. coli as production host. These problems can be grouped into two categories: those that are due to the sequence of the gene of interest and those that are due to the limitations of E. coli as a host (Brown et al., 2006). In the first category again there are three ways in which the nucleotide sequence might prevent efficient expression of a foreign gene. Firstly, the foreign gene may contain introns which would be a major problem since E. coli genes do not contain introns and so the bacterium does not possess necessary machinery for removing introns from transcripts. Secondly, the foreign gene might contain sequences which act as termination signals in E. coli. These sequences are perfectly innocuous in the normal host cell, but in the bacterium it results in the premature termination and a loss of gene expression. Thirdly, a problem with codon bias of the gene making E. coli not an ideal host for translation. Although all organisms use the same genetic code, each organism has a bias towards preferred codons. This bias reflects the efficiency with which the tRNA molecules are able to recognize the different codons. If a cloned gene contains a high proportion of unfavoured codons, the host cell's tRNAs may encounter difficulties in translating the gene, reducing the amount of protein that is synthesized (Brown et al., 2006). These problems can be solved, with necessary manipulations although it is time consuming. If the gene contains introns then its complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared from the mRNA and so lacking introns might be used as an alternative.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli has been used as an expression host for the production of a wide range of recombinant proteins (Baneyx 1999;Baneyx and Mujacic 2004). Several expression systems have been developed for the high-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli (Makrides 1996). Among the various expression systems used, the temperature-inducible expression system has been beneficial due to the ease of induction and higher induction strength (Seeger et al. 1995;Gupta et al. 1999). \n\nHowever, the use of temperature up-shift as an induction mechanism influences several cellular processes, including the up-regulation of the heat shock proteins such as molecular chaperones and proteases (Hoffmann et al. 2002;Weber et al. 2002). \n\nThe role of induction mechanism on recombinant protein production has been investigated for certain recombinant proteins in the literature. For an aggregation prone recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor, the temperature-induced expression was found to result in increased productivity and higher yield (Seeger et al. 1995). In the case of soluble Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase (CAT) the productivity of the temperatureinducible system was lower compared to chemicallyinduced system (Harcum and Haddadin 2006). Further, the global transcriptome response of recombinant E. coli producing soluble recombinant CAT was analyzed during chemical induction, temperature induction and dual induction conditions (chemical and temperature induction). The transcriptome response of the classical heat shock genes was found to be similar in the wild-type and dual stressed cultures, even though many other genes were found to be differentially expressed in these cultures. This indicates that modeling the dynamics of the heat shock proteins and their mechanism of interaction with the recombinant protein could give useful insights. \n\nThe role played by the various heat shock proteins in assisting solubilization, folding and degradation of recombinant proteins in E. coli has been extensively reviewed by Hoffmann and Rinas (2004).",

            "text": "Since the advent of production of recombinant proteins, application of therapeutic and diagnostic proteins as biopharmaceuticals was changed remarkably (Walsh 2014). These proteins are required in huge amount and usually can not be obtained from natural sources due to extremely low availability. Moreover, Genetically engineered proteins with special benefits (e.g. Insulin analogs) are as such molecules which can therefore only be obtained via recombinant technology (Walsh 2000(Walsh , 2006;;Sanchez and Demain 2012). Escherichia coli was the first and still popularly used host for the fast and economical production of recombinant proteins (Vincentelli and Romier 2013;Chance et al. 1981;Choi and Lee 2004;Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014;Lebendiker and Danieli 2014). In-depth knowledge of genetic and biochemical pathways of E. coli and availability of variety of vectors made is an attractive host for such purposes. Although significant improvements have been made at transcription, translation and translocation, still obtaining soluble and bioactive proteins is a major challenge (Pines and Inouye 1999;Baneyx 1999;Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014). \n\nSecreted proteins such as antibodies, enzymes, hormones etc. are used for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Secreted proteins having two or more cysteines makes disulfide bonds, which is usually vital for structure formation and bioactivity (Creighton 1997b;Creighton et al. 1995;Clarke and Fersht 1993). The cytosol of E. coli is reducing which gives inclusion bodies when such proteins are expressed in the cytosol (Freedman 1989;Hwang et al. 1992;Aslund et al. 1994;Carmel-Harel and Storz 2000;Russel 1995;Messens and Collet 2006). Usually in vitro oxidative refolding is difficult, laborious, time consuming and may be uneconomical depending upon refolding yield (Lilie et al. 1998;Lange and Rudolph 2009;Yamaguchi et al. 2013;Basu et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most commonly used system for production of recombinant human proteins. Despite its known limitation in protein folding and its inability to perform certain post-translational modifications, proteins expressed in and purified from E. coli are widely used as research tools, for example, in proteomics for various functional and structural analyses or as biopharmaceuticals. 1,2 Reasons for choosing E. coli as an expression host are its fast growth and its well understood genetics which offers an unmatched toolbox for genetic engineering. However, high-level and reliable transgene expression in in vivo and cell-free E. coli expression systems is often hampered by the presence of nonfrequently used codons within the gene-coding region. There is a strong correlation between the availability of tRNAs and the frequency their respective codon is used by the expressing host. 3 Codons not favoured by E. coli are for example, AGG and AGA which both code for Arginine and frequently occur in human genes. A strategy to overcome expression limitations caused by non-preferred codons is to co-express certain tRNAs. Although coexpression of selected tRNAs can overcome expression problems to some extend due to the presence of extremely rare codons, it has been reported that best and most consistent expression of a malaria protein has been achieved only by consequently adapting the entire gene to most frequently used E. coli codons. 4 In addition to codon choice and tRNA availability, other sequence-based factors influence expression yields, for example, the presence of an 8 base pair stem loop structure near the Shine-Dalgarno ribosomal entry site 5 and the AU-content of the mRNA. 6,7 The presence of intragenic sequences mimicking E. coli ribosomal entry sites, as found in many mammalian genes, may lead to truncated products during heterologous expression 8 and should be avoided. Therefore, sequence optimization has to be balanced between introducing frequently used codons and avoiding mRNA secondary structures, extreme GC-content and DNA motifs such as internal ribosomal entry sites for which usually elaborated software is necessary. 9",

Additionally, random protein engineering of enzymes and proteins aimed for expression in S. cerevisiae are often mutagenized and pre\u2010screened in E. coli before expression in yeast. This introduces artificial bottlenecks as the bacterial expression vector needs to be substituted for a yeast expression vector via sub\u2010cloning, and the new library re\u2010evaluated before a final screening in yeast. Here, we put forward a protein expression and engineering strategy that involves the use of a dual\u2010host shuttle vector (pYB\u2010Dual) designed with both a strong inducible yeast promoter (pGAL1), and a strong inducible bacterial promoter (pT7\u2010RNAP), which allows for inducible protein expression in both species. Additionally, we demonstrate that by transforming the pYB\u2010Dual vector into the E. coli strain Rosetta 2, which has elevated levels of 7 rare tRNAs, we can achieve high\u2010level protein expression in both yeast and bacteria, even when using a mNeonGreen gene codon optimized for yeast.

Escherichia coli is one of the best known and most often used host organisms for economical protein production. However, upon over-expression, protein aggregates called inclusion bodies (IBs) are often formed. Until recently IBs formation represented a bottleneck in protein production as they were considered as deposits of inactive proteins. However, recent studies show that by choosing the appropriate host strain and designing an optimal production process, IBs composed from properly folded and biologically active recombinant proteins can be prepared. Such active protein particles can be further used for the isolation of pure proteins or as whole active protein particles in various biomedical and other applications. Therefore interest in understanding the mechanisms of their formation as well as their properties is increasing.",

            "text": "The advent of recombinant DNA technologies and the ability to transform microbial organisms with synthetic DNA has revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry (Walsh 2014). As a first demonstration, plasmid DNA encoding insulin chain A and B was introduced into Escherichia coli and shown to be capable of using the bacterial machinery to produce recombinant insulin for use in patients, albeit at poor yield (Johnson 1983). Since that time, many expression platforms have been developed to harness the unique characteristics of each protein. In instances where post-translational modifications are required, the expression systems of choice are Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, insect cells, or the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris (Ahmad et al. 2014;Kim et al. 2012;Vrljic et al. 2011). When relatively large quantities of simple proteins lacking post-translational modifications are required, E. coli is the system of choice (Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014). Since their introduction, each expression system has been examined in detail to determine which factors facilitate protein folding and also to identify the rate-limiting steps of protein production (Sato and Inaba 2012). Once identified, it has been possible to modify the host organism or growth parameters to overcome these rate-limiting steps in order to increase recombinant protein accumulation (Lilie et al. 1994;Sato and Inaba 2012;Horwich et al. 1999). \n\nRecently, eukaryotic green microalgae have been explored as a potential protein production platform. Algae offer attractive production features, including photosynthetic growth (Franklin and Mayfield 2004), ease of genetic manipulations (Grossman 2000), and unique biochemical compartments (Tran et al. 2009).

            "text": "The advent of recombinant DNA technologies and the ability to transform microbial organisms with synthetic DNA has revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry (Walsh 2014). As a first demonstration, plasmid DNA encoding insulin chain A and B was introduced into Escherichia coli and shown to be capable of using the bacterial machinery to produce recombinant insulin for use in patients, albeit at poor yield (Johnson 1983). Since that time, many expression platforms have been developed to harness the unique characteristics of each protein. In instances where post-translational modifications are required, the expression systems of choice are Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, insect cells, or the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris (Ahmad et al. 2014;Kim et al. 2012;Vrljic et al. 2011). When relatively large quantities of simple proteins lacking post-translational modifications are required, E. coli is the system of choice (Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014). Since their introduction, each expression system has been examined in detail to determine which factors facilitate protein folding and also to identify the rate-limiting steps of protein production (Sato and Inaba 2012). Once identified, it has been possible to modify the host organism or growth parameters to overcome these rate-limiting steps in order to increase recombinant protein accumulation (Lilie et al. 1994;Sato and Inaba 2012;Horwich et al. 1999). \n\nRecently, eukaryotic green microalgae have been explored as a potential protein production platform. Algae offer attractive production features, including photosynthetic growth (Franklin and Mayfield 2004), ease of genetic manipulations (Grossman 2000), and unique biochemical compartments (Tran et al. 2009). These features allow green algae to produce complex heterologous proteins at a fraction of the cost of traditional protein expression platforms (Franklin and Mayfield 2004). Additionally, many green algae are edible, opening up the possibility of orally delivering bioactive proteins and removing cumbersome and costly downstream purifications associated with other expression systems (Barrera et al. 2014;Gregory et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Growing numbers of revolutionary biological products and biosimilars have thus intensified the demand for high productivity host cell lines as the choice of host cells is the most notable and influential method to increase volumetric cell yield while minimising production cost [71]. However, while achieving high product yield at low cost is much coveted, it is important to consider the structural quality of the produced molecules as the selection of expression system can heavily influence the type and degree of the product's structure, particularly glycosylation [29]. Some main traits of a good host for therapeutic production are rapid development, known organelles and functions for protein processing and secretion, as well as possessing strain engineering toolkits to integrate recombinant protein into host genome and engineer post-translational modifications [72]. Additionally, intrinsic qualities such as proven specific productivities, lack of cosecreted proteases, proteome's amount of host cell proteins, process flexibility, and absence of mammalian viral infectivity, in addition to other factors including usage of cheaper, less-refined feeds, along with robustness to shear stress, pH, and temperature can direct the selection of a prospective host as well [71]. Recombinant proteins such as antibodies can be expressed using various platforms and there have been multiple expression systems identified.\n\nThe most common strategy for producing recombinant proteins is using bacteria, typically Escherichia coli but, the foreign protein being toxic to the host, besides, protein folding machinery differences, and the absence of post-translational modifications in bacteria makes them inapt hosts for expression of functional eukaryotic proteins [8]. Yeast, insect, and plant cell-based expression systems are applicable as well but unfortunately, they form glycan structures, unlike a human's which carries the risk of undesired immunogenicity for therapeutics [29]. Additionally, the development of the aforementioned systems are fragmented, making it challenging to compare them to mammalian cell lines for potential benefits [71].\n\nAs a result, the primary framework for generation for therapeutic recombinant proteins is utilising mammalian cell lines as for ectopically expressed mammalian genes, they are the nearest likeness to the native environment and in this way have an inherent capability to create functional mammalian proteins [8].

            "text": "Escherichia coli expression systems have been widely used for the expression and manufacturing of various malarial antigens owing to their ease of use and advantages in cost and scale despite protein expression and folding obstacles. Common causes cited for poor expression of recombinant genes in heterologous hosts are the species-specific disparities in codon usage. Codon usage frequencies can potentially impact a protein's function, solubility, and length (Khan et al. 2012). \n\nIn E. coli, protein folding can occur \"co-translationally\" at the ribosome (Komar 2009;Kramer et al. 2009;Nissley et al. 2016) and variable translation rates are thought to affect tertiary structure (Nissley et al. 2016). A recent study using genome-wide analysis provided evidence of evolutionary selection for co-translational folding, underscoring the importance of translation kinetics in protein folding (Jacobs and Shakhnovich 2017). More frequently used codons are often found in well-ordered structural elements such as alpha helices, while low usage frequency codons often occur within link/end segments (Thanaraj and Argos 1996). These observations suggest that codon usage frequency plays an inherent role in cotranslational folding. \n\nBased on these concepts, we developed a strategy to \"recode\" target gene sequences for heterologous expression by substituting native codons with synonymous alternates with identical or similar usage frequencies in the expression host. This approach has been termed \"codon harmonization\", and applies a two-pronged approach. First, \"best fit\" codon usage frequency of the native gene is applied to that of the heterologous host. Second, putative link/end segments are identified and recoded to re-establish regions benefitted by slower translation (Angov et al. 2008). \n\nWe previously reported single base changes (i.e., FMP003 protein) for synonymous codon replacement can increase soluble protein yields by a factor of approximately ten, compared with native sequence yields (Angov et al. 2008). This protein was produced under cGMP conditions resulting in a highly immunogenic and efficacious product tested against malaria challenge in an Aotus monkey study (Darko et al. 2005).",

            "text": "3.1.1. Escherichia Coli. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the first and most extensively used prokaryotic expression system for heterologous protein production [7]. It remains generally the first choice due to its simplicity, rapid growth rate, and relatively low cost. Almost all commercially available inducible cloning vectors are compatible with E. coli and extensive biochemical and genetic information is available.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of using E. coli as an expression host arises from its inability to perform post-translational modifications, which are often required for correct folding and functional activity of the recombinant protein.\n\nThis applies particularly to some membrane proteins and enzymes [3]. Another disadvantage is that E. coli is generally not suitable for proteins which contain many disulfide bonds or require glycosylation, proline cis/trans isomerization, disulfide isomerization, lipidation, sulphation, or phosphorylation [8]. Some eukaryotic proteins that retain their full biological activity in the nonglycosylated form have, however, been produced in E. coli. The unglycosylated human growth hormone (hGH) binding protein secreted from E.coli retains the same binding affinity and specificity as the wild-type hGH binding protein suggesting that recombinant protein is properly folded and glycosylation is not required for binding [9].\n\nProduction of proteins that are stabilized by disulfide bonds in E.coli often results in proteolytic degradation or misfolding and formation of inclusion bodies [6]. One strategy developed to improve this situation is to target these proteins to the periplasm where the nonreducing environment allows formation of disulfide bonds [10,11]. In International Journal of Plant Genomics 3 addition, the E.coli periplasm contains chaperone-like disulfide-binding proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, and DsbD), folding catalysts, and peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (SurA, RotA, FklB, and FkpA) that support disulfide bond formation and are important for correct folding of periplasmic proteins [12][13",

            "text": "As such, considerable effort has been made to optimize bacterial hosts for antibody and antibody fragment expression. Engineering of oxidizing cellular environments, co-expression of molecular chaperones, use of periplasmic protease deficient strain of E. coli and balancing of heavy and light chain expression have all enabled increased yield of up to 1 mg/L [8,10,11]. However, these options often require some degree of further optimization such as balancing expression of each polypeptide chain, or the use of proprietary modified E. coli strains which are not readily available. Modification of translation initiation regions (TIRs) to reduce protein translation rates has also had some success at improving overall yield [12]. The lower translation rate is believed to decrease protein load on the secretory system, reducing the accumulation of unprocessed products in the cytoplasm. Indeed, the high level expression of antibody obtained in fermentor cultures was obtained using balanced but low strength TIRs for both heavy and light chains [8]. \n\nIn this study, we explored strategies for optimization of antibody expression in general laboratory strains of E. coli using simple methods for reducing translation rates. These include the use of a low-copy number plasmid, reduction of inducer concentration and induction of antibody HC/LC at late log phase. Single step purification on Protein A resulted in co-elution of bacterial proteins along with degraded heavy chain. Introduction of a second purification step with Protein L successfully removed contaminating proteins and heavy chain fragments.",

            "text": "There are several methods for preparing bacterial competency. Those methods were from complicated [9,8] up to the simple methods of using DMSO and PEG (polyethylene glycol with replacing Ca 2+ ions) and a short incubation of both bacteria and DNA on ice (replacing the heat shock) [2]. Those methods are intended to increase transformation efficiency of E. coli subsequently facilitating further step in expression of recombinant protein. \n\nHost cell of Escherichia coli (E. coli) is commonly used for recombinant protein expression. The E. coli is one organism of choices for the production of recombinant proteins [19]. As a cell manufacturer, the E. coli host cell is well-established and has become the most popular expression media. Due to those reason, E. coli is often used as a bio-manufacture of protein expression and even for the high-level production of heterologous protein. There are many strains of E. coli in which one of them is NiCo strain. This NiCo strain has some advantageous compared to other strains in terms of increasing expression and purity of protein (13). \n\nE. coli strain NiCo is a result of modified BL21 strain of E. coli by substituting GLMs gene with GLSs6Ala gene and adding genes of SlyD, can and ArnsA at ORF chitin binding domain [18]. By addition of those genes into NiCo strain it would be the advantage of NiCo in increasing the production of recombinant protein target and minimize non targeting recombinant protein [7,17]. \n\nThe protein encoded by an interest gene would express their protein after inducing with IPTG [22]. Optimization of protein expression is always expected by researchers with focus on the strategy to reduce time and expenses. Different IPTG concentrations might be the manner to find which is more effective and efficient in protein production. \n\nCombination of transformation efficiency for host cell preparation in prior protein expression and applying different IPTG concentrations were to be interested in this study in order to optimize the protein yield. In previous study, a viral tat gene was constructed conventionally into pET his-tag and successfully expressed recombinant protein JTAT through E. coli BL21 strain [15].",

Briefly, recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified with Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech Laboratories). Concentrated protein stocks were maintained in HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) at -20\u02daC. The identities of the proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Recombinant Y. pestis LcrV and F1 were also produced in E. coli. Protein bands were detected at the expected size either by staining with Coomassie blue, or after electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories), using mouse polyclonal antigen-specific sera. The endotoxin content of the different protein preparations was determined by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate kinetic-QCL assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Lonza).

To best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the successful enhancement of the soluble and functional expression of rHSA in E. coli cytoplasm. \n\nThe presently developed process has remarkably shortened and simplified the soluble rHSA preparation using E. coli as a host. The substantial reduction of rHSA aggregation in the host system has been accomplished by employment of an optimized set of crucial yet very basic cellular, environmental, folding parameters, and employment of an exogenous molecular chaperone system. The present development also takes into consideration the optimal recovery of the functional protein produced in the E. coli host system during the cell lysis step with cheaper ingredients and thereby providing a strategy to overcome one of the major limitations in earlier attempts of E. coli based rHSA production [17,18]. \n\nThe developed process thus paves the way for exploiting the most well studied, potentially low cost, scalable host system available for the enhancement of functional expression of the therapeutic protein with immense potential i.e. HSA in a cost-effective manner, which has not been attempted earlier. The present work has filled in the gap in the literature by exploiting the enhanced capabilities of E. coli system as an alternative host for the production of the immensely important, multi-application oriented recombinant therapeutic protein like HSA which is truly important and immensely demand driven, in a cost-effective manner.",

            "text": "The diversity of chemical and structural attributes of proteins makes it inherently difficult to produce a wide range of proteins in a single recombinant protein production system. The nature of the target proteins themselves, along with cost, ease of use, and speed, are typically cited as major factors to consider in production. Despite a wide variety of alternative expression systems, most recombinant proteins for research and therapeutics are produced in a limited number of systems: Escherichia coli , yeast, insect cells, and the mammalian cell lines HEK293 and CHO. Recent interest in Vibrio natriegens as a new bacterial recombinant protein expression host is due in part to its short doubling time of \u2264\u200910\u00a0min but also stems from the promise of compatibility with techniques and genetic systems developed for E. coli . We successfully incorporated V. natriegens as an additional bacterial expression system for recombinant protein production and report improvements to published protocols as well as new protocols that expand the versatility of the system. While not all proteins benefit from production in V. natriegens , we successfully produced several proteins that were difficult or impossible to produce in E. coli . We also show that in some cases, the increased yield is due to higher levels of properly folded protein. Additionally, we were able to adapt our enhanced isotope incorporation methods for use with V. natriegens . Taken together, these observations and improvements allowed production of proteins for structural biology, biochemistry, assay development, and structure-based drug design in V. natriegens that were impossible and/or unaffordable to produce in E. coli . Production of proteins with reduced aggregation compared to E. coli . Optimized protocols for efficiency and protein expression. Improved yield for specific proteins compared to E. coli .",

            "text": "Methodologies to obtain large amount of folded transport proteins are essential for studying their structure and structure/function relationships. Each of the strategies currently used for producing transport proteins obviously presents advantages and disadvantages. The features of each methodology have to be considered as function of the specific protein and of the studies to be carried out. This will help the choice of the appropriate experimental systems. This argument has been previously well reviewed [11]. In principle, eukaryotic expression systems would be better for obtaining correctly folded proteins. However, these systems, with very few exceptions, give lower yields with respect to bacterial ones. Hence, proteins obtained by expression in eukaryotic organisms are normally not sufficient for structural studies. Thus, several efforts are in progress to find suitable conditions for bacterial expression which remains the method of election for recovering high amounts of proteins. This system also allows to perform minimal modification of the proteins, such as His tag insertion that facilitates the further purification step, which is also essential for structural and functional studies. \n\nFor its low costs, harmless for humans, fast growth, easy handiness, and wide empirical experience in its usage, E. coli is the most used microorganism for protein expression. However, there are still a lot of unsolved problems limiting the expression of mammalian membrane transporters and, in general, of hydrophobic proteins. These problems are mainly caused by differences in both DNA composition and protein structure between bacteria and mammals. E. coli strains have been originally engineered to improve mammalian protein expression. Examples are E. coli BL21(DE3) and K-12 from which other optimized strains were derived [12,13]. \n\nTwo clue points in which it can be possible to act for obtaining increase of heterologous membrane protein expression are listed below: \n\nCodon Usage and Host Choice An important challenge for heterologous expression is the different codon usage of mammals and in particular humans, which causes difficulties in expressing proteins in bacteria [14]. For example, E. coli does not use certain codons (such as AUA for Ile, or AGA and AGG for Arg) that are frequently used in mammalian genes [15].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli expression is a widely used prokaryotic expression system in the field of genetic engineering to industrialize antimicrobial peptide production [96]. Today, it has a mature commercial expression vector and gene operating system. However, AMPs cannot be directly expressed using the E. coli system in commercial settings. AMPs are highly lethal to host E. coli, and the expression of AMPs in E. coli inhibits the proliferation of the host, which reduces the expression of AMPs. In addition, antibacterial peptides are very sensitive to proteases and can be easily degraded by proteases secreted by the host E. coli; therefore, it is difficult to achieve high expression. The fusion expression of AMPs in E. coli could effectively solve the above problems [97]. Recombinant fusion proteins can be further purified to obtain expression targets with antibacterial activity. The commonly used carrier proteins are those that promote soluble expression and precipitation expression [9]. \n\nCarrier proteins that promote soluble expression, such as glutathione transferase (GST) and thioxoreductase (TRX), promote the expression of the target protein in the host in a solubilized and correctly folded manner [98,99]. The small-molecule ubiquitinated protein (SMUP) is a new expression vector which can increase the proportion of the target protein in the fusion protein and improve the yield of the target protein. The specificity of SMUP protease makes it easier for AMPs to be released from the fusion protein [100]. More importantly, soluble expressed fusion peptides are easier to purify and can be directly purified with a specific affinity using six histidine tags or GST tags. \n\nCarrier proteins that improve precipitate expression promote fusion proteins to form inclusion bodies in the host, such as ketosteroid isomerases [101]. Inclusion bodies are water-insoluble structures formed by large amounts of proteins in E. coli gathered and formed in a membrane-enclosed or membrane-leakless structure. Inclusion bodies can be collected in large quantities via simple fractional centrifugation, and their purification process is simple.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is generally the first choice of host for the production of proteins and chemicals, because of its fast growth rate, a well-established expression system, high production yield, and low manufacturing cost. In E. coli cytoplasm, however, recombinant proteins tend to interact with non-specific hydrophobic patches, leading to the formation of inclusion bodies (Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004). To enhance soluble expression of recombinant proteins, various strategies have been suggested: N-terminus and/or C-terminus truncation, co-expression of chaperones, and fusion protein technologies (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005). To date, Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST), E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP), E. coli N-utilization substance A (NusA), and E. coli thioredoxin are commonly used as fusion partners to prevent inclusion body formation (Esposito and Chatterjee, 2006). Although fusion partners provide a general protective effect against insoluble aggregation, some soluble fusions lack detectable activities (Sachdev and Chirgwin, 1999). These soluble aggregates are formed by agglomeration of misfolded proteins of interest, while precipitation is prevented by the presence of the soluble fusion partners (Nomine et al., 2001). Thus, an alternative fusion system should be developed to increase soluble expression levels and simultaneously block agglomeration formation between misfolded target proteins. \n\nAs model proteins, we chose two fucosyltransferases (FTs). FTs transfer the fucosyl residue of GDP-L-fucose to lactose, leading to the formation of fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Microbial production of HMOs has received great attention, as they show beneficial effects on human health, such as prevention of pathogenic infection, modulation of the immune system, and prebiotic effects (Bode, 2015).",

            "text": "Many different microorganisms and animal cell cultures are used as heterologous hosts to produce recombinant proteins for use as biopharmaceuticals. The first expression systems were derived from Escherichia coli strains, and these are still widely used today as cell factories to produce peptide therapeutics because of seminal knowledge accumulated over many decades, most notably pioneering studies elucidating mechanisms that govern gene expression first demonstrated by the lac operon. \n\nStudies of the lac operon began in the 1950s with the discovery of ortho-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-galactoside (ONPG) as a synthetic substrate of \u03b2-galactosidase (Seidman & Link, 1950 ) and, the development of a simple and inexpensive method for quantification of \u03b2-galactosidase activity. In less than one decade after the invention of ONPG, the main components of the lac operon had been identified and, a detailed mechanism of gene regulation had been proposed (Pardee et al., 1959 ;Jacob & Monod, 1961 ;Jacob et al., 1964 ). Many fundamental concepts of molecular biology have subsequently been derived from these studies such as the nature of gene, the existence of operons and promoters, and mechanisms of gene repression and induction. In the E. coli wild type lac operon three genes are sequentially transcribed, encoding a \u03b2-galactosidase, a lactose permease (lacY), and a transacetylase (M\u00fcller-Hill, 1996 ). Lactose permease facilitates uptake of galactosides, particularly lactose, which is cleaved by \u03b2-galactosidase into galactose and allolactose (Kaback & Guan, 2019 ).",

            "text": "Cells are surrounded by complex envelopes that control the exchange of metabolites, catabolites, energy and signals with the environment [1,2]. For this manifold requirements, they rely on membrane integrated proteins that differ in structure and function. Up to 30% of all genes in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes encode such membrane proteins [3] and their malfunction often causes serious diseases like diabetes or cystic fibrosis [4,5]. To gain insight into the structure and function of membrane proteins, it is crucial to purify them in sufficient amounts and in a properly folded state [6]. As they are usually not sufficiently abundant in the native cell membrane, numerous expression systems for the recombinant production of membrane proteins have been established. They differ in the host organism used, the transcriptional regulation or the post-translational modifications of the proteins [7,8]. However, due to their hydrophobic nature, studies on membrane proteins are challenging and in many cases already their production fails. \n\nEscherichia coli is the most commonly used prokaryotic host for the recombinant production of membrane protein. The organism is comprehensively characterized and can be cultivated in a cost efficient manner. Growth in rich and minimal media to high cell densities is possible over a wide range of temperatures within the course of 1 day. Escherichia coli's genome was sequenced in 1997 [9] facilitating the directed design of specialized strains for protein production [10,11]. Genetic tools to create gene deletion or insertion mutants are available and transient gene expression is enabled by the availability of a large number of vectors and promoters [12]. Taken together, E. coli is part of the most advanced prokaryotic production systems available but still membrane protein production is a bottleneck in many studies. Different Bacillus species, Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Lactococcus lactis and several further species are successfully used for the commercial production of predominantly soluble proteins [7], but only L. lactis is frequently used as an alternative host for the production of membrane proteins [13]. As a Gram-positive bacterium it differs from E. coli in several aspects, e.g.",

However, most of the eukaryotic proteins are typically obtained as insoluble, misfolded inclusion bodies that need solubilization and refolding. Reteplase as a highly disulfide-bonded recombinant protein is an example of difficult to express protein in E. coli. Methods: In this study, a codon optimized reteplase gene was synthetically prepared and cloned under the control of an IPTG inducible T7 promoter. The vector was simultaneously transformed and expressed in three different E. coli strains. The ability of strains for expression of this recombinant pharmaceutical was compared. Also, an attempt was made to increase the soluble production of reteplase in SHuffle T7 E. coli with alterations of expression condition like temperature, inducer concentration and oxygen supply. Results: High amounts of reteplase were expressed as inclusion bodies in all three strains. BL21 (DE3) showed the highest level of expression in inclusion bodies followed by Rosetta-gami (DE3) and Shuffle T7. Changes of expression conditions were insufficient for soluble expression of reteplase in SHuffle T7 as a genetically engineered host for production of disulfide bonded proteins. Conclusion: The oxidizing cytoplasm of Rosetta-gami and Shuffle T7 in addition to alterations of cultivation parameters could not result in soluble production of reteplase, although the inclusion bodies produced in these two strains might increase the rate of refolding procedure likely due to formation of folding intermediates.",

However, it can be mentioned with certainty that E. coli is one of the most widely used hosts for the production of pharmaceutical recombinant proteins on an industrial scale. This system is the good choice for the functional expression of non-glycosylated proteins. The advantages of this system include fast growth, high cell density using simple and low cost growth medium, known genetic information, availability of a large number of expression vectors and availability of mutant host strains, simple transfer, easy control, possibility of mass production of recombinant proteins and thus cost-effectiveness. In the case of yeast and mammalian hosts, in most cases, protein production is much lower and more expensive than E. coli host is.",

            "text": "Eukaryotic systems, on the other hand, appear to be superior in producing soluble and active eukaryotic proteins [18][19][20][21]. However, their final yield tends to be lower, and the production process is more labor intensive, requiring special media and equipment, which may significantly increase the total cost of production. Another variation on the theme is the production of proteins in so-called cell-free systems. In this case, instead of using a host organism, an in vitro mixture is reconstituted for protein expression [22]. These systems are relatively costly and are not suited for high-level protein expression, even though they allow fast production and incorporation of special amino acids [23]. \n\nThe most common host organism for recombinant protein production is Escherichia coli (E. coli) [24]. As an expression system, E. coli is easy to handle, cheap, has a high growth rate and usually produces large quantities of the desired recombinant protein [25]. As mentioned earlier, its major disadvantage is the lack of PTMs, which can result in improper folding and/or IB formation of expressed eukaryotic proteins. Furthermore, bacterial codon usage, which differs from that of eukaryotes, may also be a limiting factor. This is more evident in the case of human recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria. All in all, this system is still widely used due to its many advantages, as intense research is also being conducted to overcome its limitations [11,[25][26][27][28]. For example, the introduction of solubility tag(s) or co-expression of molecular chaperones can significantly improve solubility of expressed proteins [29][30][31][32]. Codon bias can also be overcome via codon optimization, or by using special strains that contain transfer RNAs (tRNAs) at levels typical of eukaryotes [24,33]. Genetic modification of E. coli strains even allows the production of glycosylated antibodies [13,34,35]. \n\nIntrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are proteins that lack well-defined 3D structures [36].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli recombinant protein production systems are designed to achieve a high accumulation of soluble protein product in the bacterial cell. However, a strong and rapid protein production can lead to stressful situations for the host cell, resulting in protein misfolding in vivo, and consequent aggregation into inclusion bodies (Schumann and Ferreira, 2004;Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005a,b;Sevastsyanovich et al., 2010). For instance, macromolecular crowding of proteins at high concentrations in the E. coli cytoplasm often impairs the correct folding of proteins, leading to the formation of folding intermediates that, when inefficiently processed by molecular chaperones, promote inclusion body formation (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005a,b).\n\nStrategies that direct the soluble production of proteins in E. coli are, thus, envisaged, and become more attractive than protein refolding procedures from inclusion bodies.\n\nSeveral methods have been shown to prevent or decrease protein aggregation during protein production in E. coli on a trial-and-error basis, including:\n\n(i) Lower expression temperatures: bacteria cultivation at reduced temperatures is often used to reduce protein aggregation, since it slows down the rate of protein synthesis and folding kinetics, decreasing the hydrophobic interactions that are involved in protein self-aggregation (Schumann and Ferreira, 2004;Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005b). Low cultivation temperatures can also reduce or impair protein degradation due to a poor activity of heat shock proteases that are usually induced during protein overproduction in E. coli (Chesshyre and Hipkiss, 1989). This strategy has, however, some drawbacks as the reduction of temperature can also affect replication, transcription, and translation rates, besides decreasing the bacterial growth and protein production yields. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by the use of coldinducible promoters that maximize protein production under low temperature conditions (Mujacic et al., 1999). (ii) E. coli-engineered host strains: E. coli mutant strains are a significant advance toward the soluble production of difficult recombinant proteins. Several targeted strain strategies have been developed through the introduction of DNA mutations that affect protein synthesis, degradation, secretion, or folding (reviewed in Ma",

This bacterium is suitable for protein recombinant host since it has rapid growth, high expression rate, and well-known genome.

Apart from that, our group succeeded in producing beta galactosidase from a wild type E. coli strain B130.

            "text": "Background Therapeutic antibodies are predominantly produced in mammalian cells, most commonly in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Another production host, albeit not as common as CHO, is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is capable of high-level expression and assembly of fulllength IgG antibodies in the periplasm [1], however, E. coli lacks the enzymatic machinery to support post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. Therefore, antibodies produced in E. coli lack Fc effector functions, which could be advantageous when the intended therapeutic indication requires only an antibody's blocking function. Depending on the intended molecule's design (e.g., antibody fragments), use of E. coli as an expression system may offer some advantages over CHO cells. E. coli processes also have faster development timelines and lower production costs.\n\nIn this work, an E. coli host with periplasmic expression was used for manufacturing-scale production of the unique recombinant \"one-armed\" monovalent mAb1, which has an ability to block the target receptor without inducing its dimerization and activation. In comparison, the standard format, i.e., a bivalent antibody with the same specificity activates the target receptor leading to the opposite effect than intended. mAb1 is a humanized, monovalent, monoclonal antibody based on the IgG1 framework. It is composed of a full-length heavy chain, a light chain, and a truncated heavy chain that consists of only the hinge region and the C H 2 and C H 3 domains (Fig. 1). mAb1 is aglycosylated (since it's produced in E. coli) and has an approximate molecular mass of 99 kDa. To ensure proper heterodimerization of the Fc, where a full-length heavy chain is disulfide-linked to a truncated heavy chain, two heavy chains have been engineered utilizing the \"knobs-into-holes\" approach [2].\n\nProper assembly of mAb1 relies on the correct and efficient formation of multiple disulfide bonds. In mAb1, there are 22 cysteine residues, and all these cysteine residues are involved in disulfide bond formation resulting in 11 disulfide bonds, of which 3",

Important applications of recombinant proteins are: (1) immunization, (2) biochemical studies, (3) three-dimensional analysis of the protein, and (4) biotechnological and therapeutic use. Production of recombinant proteins involves cloning of the appropriate gene into an expression vector under the control of an inducible promoter. But efficient expression of the recombinant gene depends on a variety of factors such as optimal expression signals (both at the level of transcription and translation), correct protein folding and cell growth characteristics. Display of recombinant proteins on the bacterial surface has many potential biotechnological applications and requires further knowledge on targeting motifs present on carrier proteins usually used as fusion partners. In addition, the selection of a particular expression system requires a cost breakdown in terms of design, process and other economic considerations. The relative merits of bacterial, yeast, insect and mammalian expression systems have been reviewed in Marino (1989). \n\nThis review article deals exclusively with Escherichia coli cells as a protein factory. Despite its extensive knowledge on genetics and molecular biology, there is no a priori guarantee that every gene can be expressed efficiently in this Gram-negative bacterium. Factors influencing the expression level include unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and efficiency of mRNA, correct and efficient protein folding, codon usage, degradation of the recombinant protein by ATP-dependent proteases and toxicity of the protein. The objectives of this article are to review the potential influence of these different parameters on the yield of recombinant proteins and to provide the reader with practical suggestions allowing optimization of recombinant protein production and targeting to different compartments of the bacterial cell.

            "text": "The development of recombinant protein vaccines has been described as a promising approach to elicit potential immune responses, and recombinant proteins are emerging as potentially strong candidates for immunization against bacterial diseases based on the practical advantages of stability, safety, high immunogenicity with the use of adjuvants, and a proven track record in clinical development. The recombinant protein platform is considered to be safe and non-infectious. It is easier to produce a vaccine antigen as a recombinant protein when compared to LAVs and IVs [50]. The advantage associated with immunization using recombinant protein vaccines is that they do not require the use of cold chain storage in freezers and liquid nitrogen to store and preserve the vaccine at temperatures lower than \u221280 \u2022 C, which suggests that they could be used to immunize populations in resource-poor third world countries lacking cold chain facilities. Indeed, recombinant protein vaccines may be freeze-dried or lyophilized, allowing them to be preserved in a dried powdered form. For example, Lai et al. (2021) discussed the development of insect cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain constructs compatible with lyophilization and storage in a dry thermostabilized state [51]. Moreover, freeze-dried, heat-stable formulations of influenza subunit vaccines were safe and immunogenic when administered to mice [52]. \n\nThere are several expression systems available for the production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is commonly used as an expression system since it possesses unparalleled fast-growth kinetics, enabling the rapid production of recombinant proteins. The ability to achieve high cell density cultures is another significant benefit, as it enables large-scale production of proteins in a more efficient manner. Additionally, E. coli expression systems utilize media that can be easily formulated using readily available and inexpensive components, thereby reducing production costs. Moreover, the process of transforming E. coli with exogenous recombinant DNA is fast and straightforward, facilitating the introduction of the desired genes for protein expression [53].",

The recombinant DNA technology and heterologous protein expression have helped simplify the isolation of targeted polypeptides at high purity and their structure-function examinations. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli, the most-established heterologous host organism, has been widely used to produce proteins of commercial and fundamental research interests. Nonetheless, many peptides/proteins are still difficult to express due to their ability to slow down cell growth or disrupt cellular metabolism. Besides, special modifications are often required for proper folding and activity of targeted proteins. The cell-free (CF) or in vitro recombinant protein synthesis system enables the production of such difficult-to-obtain molecules since it is possible to adjust reaction medium and there is no need to support cellular metabolism and viability. Here, we describe E. coli-based CF systems, the optimization steps done toward the development of highly productive and cost-effective CF methodology, and the modification of an in vitro approach required for difficult-to-obtain protein production.",

A variety of protein expression systems are available, but nowadays almost all therapeutic antibodies are produced in mammalian cell lines due to their complex structure and glycosylation requirements. However, production of clinical-grade antibodies in mammalian cells is very expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is known to be the simplest, fastest and most cost-effective recombinant expression system, which usually achieves higher protein yields than mammalian cells. Indeed, it is one of the most popular host in the industry for the expression of recombinant proteins. In this work, a trivalent single-chain fragment variable (scFv)-based N-terminal trimerbody, specific for native laminin-111, was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in E. coli. Mammalian and bacterially produced anti-laminin trimerbody molecules display comparable functional and structural properties, although importantly the yield of trimerbody expressed in E. coli was considerably higher than in human cells. These results demonstrated that E. coli is a versatile and efficient expression system for multivalent trimerbody-based molecules that is suitable for their industrial production.",

            "text": "Basic FGF, a mitogenic polypeptide, was originally identified from the bovine brain and pituitary gland (23).Owing to limited source availability, difficulty in isolation, and demand for large amounts of bFGF, high-level expression and purification of this growth factor are required for different applications such as tissue regeneration, wound healing, and stem cell research (24)(25)(26).For producing a recombinant bFGF, various hosts such as E. coli, bacillus subtilis, pichia pastoris, soybean seeds, silkworm (bombyx mori L), and rice seeds have been used (27)(28)(29)(30).In this study, an E. coli expression system was used for the over production of the FGF-2 recombinant protein.This system offers several advantages when expressing a heterologous recombinant protein, including cost effectiveness, time saving, easy culture, fast growth, and easy recovery of the recombinant protein (31).Some studies showed that using an E. coli expression system is associated with the low yield of the bFGF.An important factor that limits the high-level expression is possibly the extreme differences in the codon composition between the human and the E. coli genes (32).To solve this problem, the FGF-2 gene sequence was initially redesigned by completely replacing the less frequently used codons in E. coli by the corresponding preferred codons (17), this manipulation could upgrade the codon adaptation index (CAI) from 0.21 to 1.0 with homogeneous G/C distribution.In a codon-optimized synthetic gene sequence, a total of 84 codons (57%) were replaced.Another factor associated with low productivity is the formation of an inclusion body (33).In this regard, a thioredoxin tag was co-expressed in the pET32a (+) expression vector system to increase the solubility of FGF-2 and to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies.Between the Trx.Tag and the FGF-2 coding sequence, a 6 His-tag residue was used for detection and fast purification by affinity chromatogra-phy.",

            "text": "To prepare various antigenic proteins recombinantly, the choice of suitable expression system was always a matter of concern. However, a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been evolved to solve expression associated issues. In this section we briefly discuss the expression related problems and their alternate approaches. The prokaryotic systems have remained as first choice for expressing recombinant proteins. Among the prokaryotes, the E. coli has been considered as the most efficient and widely used host for manipulation of DNA and proteins which can express recombinants up to 30% of its cell mass [133]. The well-known genetics, high transformation efficiency, cultivation simplicity, rapid cell cycle and inexpensiveness, are the main factors that make E. coli to be the preferred host for the recombinant expression of proteins. It was reported that expression of many recombinant allergens of A. fumigatus such as Asp f3 [87], Asp f6 [91], Asp f9/Asp f16 [92], Asp f10 [93], \n\nAsp f17 [99] and Asp f23 [102] has been carried out sucessfully in the E. coli. We also produced 1 protein as full length recombinant, selected from a panel of potential allergens of A. fumigatus. \n\nThis allergen has an mRNA (AFUA_5G03520) of 972 bp which coded for a 37 kDa hypothetical protein (Uniprot ID: Q4WEM3). The recombinant 37 kDa protein was found to be reactive with IgE antibodies of ABPA patients (Unpublished data). \n\nAlthough the expression of 37 kDa full length hypothetical protein was achieved, we faced several difficulties while attempting the expression of other selected immunodominant allergens as full length proteins. Therefore, instead of expressing complete gene, reduction of the length of recombinant construct by removing the incompatible regions of DNA and selecting the functional region of target gene has been followed to express partial protein. It was speculated that the expression of partial protein may enhance the solubility of recombinants.",

            "text": "Since 1957, when the Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum (C.glutamicum) was isolated due to its ability to excrete large amounts of L-glutamate [1], C. glutamicum has been thoroughly investigated and used as a generally regarded-as-safe organism in the fermentation industry.Within the last decades, C. glutamicum was proven to be an excellent production platform for amino acids and organic acids, and a promising alternative bacterial host for the expression of recombinant proteins due to its unique characteristics.First, C. glutamicum is non-pathogenic and does not produce endotoxins.Furthermore C. glutamicum could secrete properly folded proteins into the culture medium and lacks detectable extracellular hydrolysis activity, activities that increase the subsequent purification efficiency [2].With these advantages, C. glutamicum has been widely used to express recombinant proteins such as staphylococcal nuclease [3], transglutaminase [4], human epidermal growth factor [5], antibody fragment [6], green fluorescent protein (GFP) [7] and \u03b1-amylase [8], et al.\n\nWhen C. glutamicum expresses recombinant proteins, it has several intrinsic disadvantages, such as a low transformation efficiency, few available expression vectors [6], and a lower yield than that of Escherichia coli.Tremendous efforts have been put forth into the genetic modification and cultivation of C. glutamicum to avoid these issues-for example, the development of sophisticated tools for genetic manipulation, the engineering of natural and endogenous promoters and signal peptides, the optimization of codon usage, and the knockout of some proteases to reduce the degradation of recombinant proteins [9][10][11][12][13].In addition, recombinant protein expression is also an ATP-consuming process, and an adequate supply of ATP could appropriately improve the expression level of recombinant proteins [14].",

            "text": "ecombinant production of proteins enables biochemical and structural studies, and the pET vectors hosted in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) are the most popular approach in research laboratories 1 . Fast growth, high cell density, inexpensive culturing, availability of more than 100 pET expression vectors 2 combined with the detailed knowledge of E. coli's genetics, physiology and metabolism make it the preferred laboratory workhorse. 3 This is evident from the more than 200,000 research publications that have cited the use of the pET vectors, and that currently more than 128,000 (86% of the recombinant) structures in the Protein Data Bank and approximately half of the proteins produced worldwide for research and commercial use are produced in E. coli 2,4 . This remarkable success is despite that bacteria often show impaired growth and fitness-loss when being used for protein production 5 -a problem that is highly gene-specific, and we still lack clear guiding principles for gene and cell factory optimisation 6 . \n\nMembrane proteins (MPs) are important drug targets and serve essential roles in basic cellular mechanisms. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, 20-30% of all genes encode membrane proteins. 7 MPs are involved in fundamental mechanisms such as transport of nutrients and signal molecules, response to environmental changes, membrane stability, maintenance of the redox potential, defence and energy conversion. With natural abundances often too low to isolate sufficient material for in vitro studies, structural and biochemical investigations are limited by our ability to produce and purify MPs recombinantly in a functional state. \n\nMPs are also notoriously known for causing burden in expression systems. They need to be properly inserted into the membrane and cannot be produced in inclusion bodies. This often leads to an overload of the membrane translocation machinery and has previously been reported to severely hamper protein homoeostasis in the cytoplasm leading to the accumulation of aggregates of proteases, chaperones, and overexpressed MPs 5,8,9 . In addition, competition for the limited space of the membrane causes decreased levels of key respiratory chain complexes and upregulation of the Arc two-component system, indicating serious alterations in central metabolism 5 .",

The characterization of the recombinant proteins usually displayed activity and stability parameters closely related to those from the native proteins [17,18,44].

            "text": "Using this technique, Conkunitzin-S1 (Conk-S1; see Fig. 2) was recently synthesized (Dy et al. 2006). This conopeptide belongs to a new class of conotoxins that do not contain posttranslational modifications apart from C-terminal amidation and that are structurally strongly related to Kunitz proteins (Bayrhuber et al. 2005;Dy et al. 2006). The expenses for the chemicals and protected amino acids to synthesize such large peptides are quite high. A costeffective alternative approach to produce such peptides in larger quantities is the use of bacterial and eukaryotic expression systems. The limited posttranslational machinery of these expression systems does not permit the production of peptides with the kind of posttranslational modifications found in many smaller conopeptides (Craig et al. 1999;Buczek et al. 2005). Escherichia coli is the best characterized and most widely used bacterial host for the production of recombinant proteins (Baneyx 1999;Pines and Inouye 1999). The reasons are the low costs for culturing E. coli and the short culturing times. In general, small peptides are difficult to overexpress directly in E. coli since they are either quickly degraded by cellular proteases or they accumulate to form insoluble aggregates, so-called inclusion bodies (Georgiou and Valax 1996). In addition, the cytoplasm of E. coli is a reducing environment that prevents the formation of disulfide bonds (Prinz et al. 1997), further increasing the tendency to form inclusion bodies upon overexpression. To achieve at least high expression levels of these small peptides, expressing them in fusion with larger, well-expressing carrier proteins has been the most successful approach so far (Butt et al. 1989;Malakhov et al. 2004). The use of highly soluble carrier proteins like, e.g., maltose-binding protein (Kapust and Waugh 1999), thioredoxin (Lavallie et al. 1993), or glutathione S-transferase (Nygren et al. 1994) can even lead to the expression of soluble fusion proteins.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been used as an integral host for production of recombinant proteins in biopharmaceutical industry; however, production of recombinant proteins in E. coli has been associated with serious challenges. One major part of challenges is related to the fact that the overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli often leads to the formation of misfolded protein aggregates, called inclusion bodies (IBs), mainly because of differences in folding pathways and physicochemical conditions between expression and natural hosts [1]. Although recombinant protein production via inclusion body formation system looks attractive due to attributes such as relatively straightforward IB generation to high yields, good supply of soluble protein after applying a solubilization treatment and potential clear-cut purification of target protein to high purities, IB proteins mostly contain non-functional target proteins which need to be solubilized by denaturants (e.g., high concentrations of chaotropic agents including urea and guanidinium chloride) and then refolded to functional (bioactive) counterparts [2,3]. The solubilization of IBs protein by denaturation is a simple process; however, the successful recovery of correctly-folded bioactive proteins from completely-denatured IB proteins is often a difficult step. For instance, large-scale refolding of recombinant streptokinase (rSK) from IBs separated from E. coli cells and solubilized in 4 M urea has led to a final product with biological activity much lower than the natural protein (i.e., the protein obtained from betahemolytic streptococci) [3].\n\nDue to the inefficiency of the aforementioned route of production for most proteins prone to forming IBs, directing such proteins into the periplasmic space (the region between the cytoplasmic and outer membrane) of E. coli has been considered as a potent alternative route of production [4,5]. Nevertheless, recombinant protein expression in the periplasm has been also come across with serious problems, relevant to the stress on the bacterial cells during cultivation process in bioreactor. For example, in such system,",

            "text": "Recombinant or heterologous protein production (RPP) is an important biotechnological process, with applications that range from catalysis (e.g. washing detergents) and therapeutic use (e.g. antibody production), to protein production for enzymatic characterization and crystallography. Production of human proteins in bacteria dates back to the production of the 14-codon somatostatin gene in Escherichia coli in 1977 [1]. Since then, several hosts have been explored, including other prokaryote species [2], various yeast and fungal species [3], plant, insect, and mammalian cell lines [4]. As there is no universally optimal host, the choice of host is based on various parameters (protein yield, production time, etc.) on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOne of the most critical parameters, especially for proteins of therapeutic interest, is the presence of post-translational modifications. Complex proteins might harbor disulfide bonds as well as complex glycan structures (e.g. antibodies and antibody fragments) that influence the 3D structure, serum stability and the protein effector functions [5]. However, in the case of E. coli, many engineered strains and expression platforms were made available over the years [6], including strains that enable some complex posttranslational modifications [7]. These advances, together with its easy cultivation, fast growth, and well-studied physiology explain E. coli 's role as a major host for RPP, including sensitive applications such as therapeutic protein production [8].\n\nOver-expression of recombinant proteins can lead to significant stress in the host cell, which in turn limits its capacity to function as a cell factory. First, it constitutes a general metabolic burden, as it is responsible for depletion of precursor metabolites [9]. Recombinant proteins are usually produced in very high amounts (it is not unusual to comprise 30% or more of total cellular protein in the cell), which leads to a significant stress for the cell. The latter reacts by employing a heat-shock like response, which involves the induction of chaperones, foldases and proteases [10]. Another potential drawback of RPP in bacterial cells is that many rec",

According to the marketsandmarkets website https:// www. marke tsand marke ts. com/ report (Karyolaimos et al. 2019), the production of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells had the highest income among other systems in 2021, and the income from this system was equal to 41.70% of total revenue from recombinant proteins. Also, expression based on the bacterial systems was in second place in terms of income (Fig. 1). However, disadvantages such as high cost and relatively low protein yield are more common in mammalian expression systems than in prokaryotic expression systems (Portolano et al. 2014). Prokaryotic expression systems are suitable hosts for the expression of recombinant proteins, and these organisms are known as the affordable and simplest host. The E. coli expression system is the most extensively used bacterial expression system and is the first choice for laboratory research (Koehn and Hunt 2009). Considering the vital importance of recombinant protein production in this era, this review aims to study the optimal expression conditions for recombinant proteins and the effect of various factors on recombinant protein expression in E. coli.

Previous studies (Bussow et al., 2005;Pacheco et al., 2012) reported that up to 75% of human proteins are successfully expressed in E. coli but only 25% are produced in an active soluble form using this host system. Other problems found within this host system include proper formation of disulfide bonds, absence of chaperones for the correct folding, and the miss-match between the codon usage of the host cell and the protein of interest (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Pacheco et al., 2012). Moreover, the industrial culture of E. coli leads cells to grow in harsh conditions, resulting in cell physiology deterioration (Chou, 2007;Pacheco et al., 2012).\n\nDespite the above-mentioned issues of E. coli recombinant protein production, the benefits of cost and ease of use and scale make it essential to design new strategies directed for recombinant soluble protein production in this host cell. Several strategies have been made for efficient production of proteins in E. coli, namely, the use of different mutated host strains, co-production of chaperones and foldases, lowering cultivation temperatures, and addition of a fusion partner (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). The combination of some of these strategies has improved the soluble production of recombinant proteins in E. coli, but the prediction of robust soluble protein production processes is still a \"a challenge and a necessity\" (Jana and Deb, 2005).\n\nNowadays, with the aid of genetic and protein engineering, novel tailor-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements.\n\nThis review describes the key solubility factors that correlate with successful protein production in E. coli, and it presents a comprehensive summary of the available fusion partners for protein production and purification in the bacterial host.

            "text": "The basics of the expression system have been reviewed by Kunji and coworkers (2003;2005). There are several notable cases in which functional overexpression of eukaryotic as well as bacterial membrane proteins [e.g. the human KDEL receptor and Na + /tyrosine transporter (Tyt1) of Fusobacterium nucleatum] could be achieved in L. lactis, but not in E. coli (Kunji et al., 2003;2005;Monne et al., 2005a;2007;Quick and Javitch, 2007). Among the potential advantages of L. lactis are a slower growth rate than E. coli (~1 doubling h -1 versus ~2 doublings h -1 for E. coli), which could be beneficial for expression of proteins that do not fold easily; the presence of a single membrane only, which facilitates functional characterization; and the lack of excessive proteolytic activity, which may help to prevent breakdown of expressed proteins. Just like in E. coli, coexpression of multiple proteins from different plasmids is possible in L. lactis and can be used for chaperone production alongside the membrane protein of interest (Rodionov et al., 2009). Two recent studies have shown that L. lactis also can be used for efficient incorporation of amino acid derivatives in expressed proteins (El Khattabi et al., 2008;Berntsson et al., 2009). This makes the organism a more complete alternative to E. coli for production of proteins for X-ray crystallography, where Seleno-methionine incorporation is routinely used for phase determination. \n\nBesides E. coli and L. lactis, other bacterial or archaeal organisms may also be good expression hosts for certain membrane proteins (e.g. Halobacterium salinarum and B. subtilis). An important question is: which organism to choose for the protein of interest? There is no general answer to this question, because it is impossible to predict how heterologously expressed proteins will behave in different hosts.",

            "text": "Genomic data, even if functionally annotated, need to be complemented by experimental testing to allow successful enzyme discovery for biotechnology. Most industrial applications rely on recombinantly produced microbial proteins. The choice of the most suitable expression system for the efficient production of the recombinant protein depends on several factors, such as the growth characteristics of the host cell, expression levels, intracellular or extracellular-segregation expression, posttranslational modifications, and biological activity (Liu et al., 2013). However, the main parameters to consider are (i) the enzyme production rate and (ii) the yield of the expression system (Liu et al., 2013). \n\nThe most commonly used expression system is the heterologous host Escherichia coli (E. coli) because of the short doubling time and its arsenal of established expression protocols, cloning methods, and a broad range of available plasmid vectors. Proteins adapted to high temperature or harsh pH are generally well-expressed in E. coli. However, E. coli has proven to be poorly suited for the expression of some proteins from (poly)extremophilic microbes, in particular from halophiles (Grotzinger et al., 2018). To be active at low water and at high salt concentrations, halophilic proteins display multiple acidic amino acid residues, generating a negative surface charge and allowing their solubility in high salt (Danson and Hough, 1997;Mevarech et al., 2000;Siglioccolo et al., 2011;Sinha and Khare, 2014). This feature, however, promotes their misfolding and aggregation under conditions of low ionic strength, as prevailing in E. coli cells (Danson and Hough, 1997;Mevarech et al., 2000;Siglioccolo et al., 2011;Sinha and Khare, 2014;Grotzinger et al., 2018). \n\nNonetheless, expression protocols to produce and purify recombinant halophilic proteins from several haloarchaea in E. coli have been developed (Salin et al., 1988;Camacho et al., 2002;Esclapez et al., 2006;De Castro et al., 2008).",

They are of eukaryotic origin and typically require some level of post-translational modification, such as oxidation or glycosylation, and proper disulfide bond formation is essential for protein folding and maturation into their biologically active conformation. Consequently, production of these proteins in bacterial expression systems has been challenging. Strategies to address this issue include refolding GFs expressed in bacteria from inclusion bodies or using mammalian cell culture systems (e.g., CHO, HEK293) for their production (Alexander et al., 1992;Zou and Sun, 2004). Both strategies result in high costs and render SFM cost-prohibitive for use in the production of CCM (Tripathi and Shrivastava, 2019).\n\nEscherichia coli remains a staple of recombinant protein production and when compatible with a target protein, offers advantages in terms of speed, tractability, and cost (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Several advancements in strain engineering have made E. coli an improved host for production of disulfide-containing proteins. Mutation of trxB and gor genes (Bessette et al., 1999), as well as cytoplasmic overexpression of disulfide bond isomerases (e.g., DsbC) (Lobstein et al., 2012) are strategies that have facilitated the expression of disulfide-containing proteins in E. coli, culminating in the development of commercial strains such as Rosetta-gami B (Novagen) and SHuffle T7 (NEB), respectively. In addition, the use of redox fusion partners such as thioredoxin (Trx) (LaVallie et al., 1993), glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Schafer et al., 2015), and disulfide bond isomerases (DsbA, DsbC) (Nozach et al., 2013) have greatly improved soluble expression of proteins that contain disulfide bonds in E. coli. Despite these advancements, the use of E. coli to produce soluble mitogenic GFs remains under documented as commercial production still",

            "text": "Several host systems are available for the production of recombinant proteins, ranging from Escherichia coli to mammalian cell-lines. This article highlights the benefits of using yeast, especially for more challenging targets such as membrane proteins. On account of the wide range of molecular, genetic, and microbiological tools available, use of the well-studied model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, provides many opportunities to optimize the functional yields of a target protein. Despite this wealth of resources, it is surprisingly under-used. In contrast, Pichia pastoris, a relative new-comer as a host organism, is already becoming a popular choice, particularly because of the ease with which high biomass (and hence recombinant protein) yields can be achieved. In the last few years, advances have been made in understanding how a yeast cell responds to the stress of producing a recombinant protein and how this information can be used to identify improved host strains in order to increase functional yields. Given these advantages, and their industrial importance in the production of biopharmaceuticals, I argue that S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris should be considered at an early stage in any serious strategy to produce proteins.",

            "text": "Recombinant expression presents a solid option for producing AFPs at low cost and high efficiency. In addition, sequencing technologies have generated a vast amount of genomic and transcriptomic data, providing valuable resources for discovering and designing new and more active AFPs (Amaral et al., 2012;Porto et al., 2012;Tracanna et al., 2017). Bacteria (mainly Escherichia coli), yeasts (mainly P. pastoris), and plants (e.g., tobacco plant Nicotiana tabacum) are the most common expression platforms for recombinant proteins. \n\nE. coli BL21 (DE3), deficient in proteases that may lead to protein degradation, is by far the most commonly used bacterial species as a host for recombinant production of proteins (Li, 2011). Many E. coli strains are unable to export proteins across their outer membrane. As a result, in the majority of cases, proteins are secreted into the cytoplasm or periplasm, leading to the formation of inclusion bodies (Singh et al., 2015). Examples of AFPs produced in E. coli include lactoferricin B, nikkomycin, magainin-2, and cecropin (Fern\u00e1ndez de Ullivarri et al., 2020). \n\nIn contrast to prokaryotic E. coli, eukaryotic yeasts are capable of implementing certain post-translational modifications to heterologous recombinant proteins. Yeasts commonly used as hosts for recombinant proteins include S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris, Kluyveromyces lactis, Yarrowia lipolytica, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Hansenula polymorpha. For example, the recombinant antifungal proteins serum albumin and hen lysozyme were produced by K. lactis and S. cerevisiae, respectively (Vieira Gomes et al., 2018). In addition, filamentous fungi such as A. pullulans, P. Chrysogenum, and P. digitatum have also been used to generate AFPs.",

            "text": "Many eukaryotic genes cannot be expressed efficiently in the E. coli host due to the difference in codon preference as well as toxicity of foreign protein and mRNA instability for the expression of protein encoded by the gene. It is also a very well known fact that heterologously expressed eukaryotic proteins are not post-translationally modified when it is expressed in E. coli. It is also difficult to express as soluble protein or facilitate the secretion of expressed protein into the culture medium. In addition, proteins expressed in large amounts tend to precipitate, forming inclusion bodies [10,30,31] and present an advantage with respect to higher yield and especially the purification of expressed protein. \n\nIt has been demonstrated in the literature that genes can be codon optimized to the host translational system with the significantly higher expression level than native genes [7]. Based on this knowledge, we have obtained the codon optimized NS1 gene from GENEART Inc. for expression in E. coli. In the present study, we have cloned and purified the dengue NS1 protein in E. coli for the development of monoclonal antibody and subsequently bispecific antibodies for early diagnostic applications. NS1 gene was cloned under the control of the pBAD promoter for high-level expression of recombinant protein as inclusion bodies in the bacterial cytoplasm. The final yield of purified inclusion bodies was estimated by Bradford protein assay [11] to be approximately 230-250 mg/L of initial bacterial culture which is 10-to 25-fold higher compared to previous reports using the native NS1 gene sequence. We have expressed several viral antigens in E. coli exploiting codon optimized genes and the NS1 expression is the most robust yield we have achieved (Table 3). The bacterial cell lysis by French Press and washing steps with detergent were used successfully to purify inclusion bodies from soluble protein. SDS-PAGE analysis clearly demonstrated that lysis by French Press and several washings with lysis buffer increased the purity of the inclusion bodies since the bulk of the E. coli soluble proteins were separated. The purity of inclusion bodies was also judged by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (data not shown).",

            "text": "One problem with the expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli occurs when the codon usage in the recombinant gene differs from the codon usage in the host cells. High-level expression of a gene with codons that are rarely used by E. coli depletes the internal tRNA pools and can result in incomplete translation. This problem has been thoroughly documented for the arginine codons AGA and AGO, which are the rarest codons in E. coli (Chen and Inouye, 1994). In addition, the codons for arginine (CGA), isoleucine (AUA), leucine (CUA), and proline (CCC) can affect the amount and quality of protein produced in E. coli hosts (Deana et aI., 1998;Jiang et aI., 2001). E. coli strains with extra tRNAs have been developed to solve this problem (Carstens et aI., 2002). \n\nIn order to detennine whether the appearance of multiple bands is due to a codon usage difference, the constructs of the a1891192r gene were transfonned into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) RIL strain (Stratagene, USA). \n\nExpression using E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) RIL strain. Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) RIL strain is a modified fonn of E. coli BL21(DE3) that possesses extra copies of the tRNA genes argU (AGA, AGG), ile Y (AUA) , and leuW (CUA), which encode the tRNAs that most frequently limit the translation of heterologous proteins in E. coli. Therefore, they are suitable for the highlevel expression of proteins affected by rare codon usage.",

            "text": "For heterologous protein production, secretion of proteins is beneficial compared to cytosolic expression, especially in terms of costs and the quality of produced proteins. Secretion offers various advantages for protein production, such as higher solubility and stability of target protein, reduced risk of protein degradation by cytosolic proteases, and easy purification process. \n\nAlthough, E. coli is the most preferred producer host for research laboratories, [3] its potential uses as a secretory host is limited since the expression of recombinant proteins mostly takes place either in the cytoplasm or periplasm and if in the supernatant, in low titers. For secreted proteins, Bacillus species are the expression hosts of choice with a secreted product yield of 20 g/L. [4,6,9,40] In this regard, investigating the secretion of recombinant proteins by E. coli is a continuous topic of interest and therefore, tremendous efforts have been made to investigate further improvements in the secretion efficiencies of E. coli to make it more competitive, as both laboratory and industrial strain. [6,9,41,42] mong the secretion systems of Gram-negative bacteria including E. coli, T1SS, T2SS, T3SS, T5SS, and T8SS have been used for biotechnological purposes. [6] Among them, T1SS has the most minimalistic architecture and is therefore an attractive target for further improvements. \n\nThis study set out with the aim of improving the secretion efficiency of the Hly secretion system of E. coli. As a member of the T1SS, the Hly system consists of only three compartment proteins [10] that makes the plasmid-expression of this system in the production hosts easy. [6] Recently, a 5'-untranslated region upstream of the hlyA gene, known as the Hly enhancer fragment, was identified that was able to increase the secretion level of HlyA1 fusion proteins by several folds. [20] In the current study, this Hly enhancer fragment was subjected to optimization by directed evolution using a KnowVolution campaign. [28,31]",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is the most frequently used prokaryotic expression system for production of heterologous proteins. However, efficient expression of different genes in E. coli is not a routine matter and requires a set of experiments for optimization of cultivation conditions such as induction time, inducer concentration and incubation time for maximum expression. Often, the samples must subsequently be analyzed by SDS/PAGE after lysis of the E. coli cells. Nowadays, several cell disruption methods are used (Bollag et al., 1996), but sonication or incubation with lysozyme from chicken egg play the main role in laboratory practice. All these methods are time consuming, and an easier and faster method is desired. The commercially available E. coli strains, like BL21(DE3)pLysS or Rosetta(DE3)pLysS, used in Novagen's pET System or T7 Expression Systems (Invitrogen) enable high-level expression of recombinant proteins and elimination of basal expression level. They are also designed for easier cell disruption after expression as they produce low amounts of T7 lysozyme (Studier, 1991). Unfortunately, there is no such option available for the pBAD expression systems. Therefore, we have developed self-lysing E. coli strains for the arabinose-induced expression systems. First, we constructed a pLysN plasmid (Fig. 1) that allowed expression of lysozyme T7 at low levels in bacterial cells. This plasmid was obtained using the pACYC184 cloning vector. The DNA fragment containing lac promoter and lac operator was amplified by PCR using the DNA of plasmid pUC19 as the template. The primers used were: PromS1 5'-GAGGATCGGTCGACGCGCAACG-CAATTAATGTGA-3' and PromClys 5'-GTACAC-GAGCCATAGCTGTTTCCTGTGTGTGAAATTG-3'.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is extensively used for industrial production of recombinant proteins due to its well-characterized genetics and ability to grow rapidly to a high density on inexpensive substrates [1]. However, it is a common problem for recombinant protein aggregates to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and/or periplasm upon gene over-expression in E. coli [2,3]. This complex phenomenon has many contributing factors: insolubility of the product at the concentrations being produced, inability to fold correctly in the bacterial environment, or lack of appropriate bacterial chaperone proteins [4,5]. Several strategies are commonly employed to reduce inclusion bodies: a) controlling the rate of protein synthesis, b) enabling secretion into the periplasm, and c) co-expression of chaperone genes. The control of the rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by changing the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium [6]. The secretion of recombinant proteins into the periplasm of E. coli has also been shown to benefit the production of certain recombinant proteins resulting in higher solubility of the gene product, correct folding, and facilitated downstream processing [1,5,7,8,9,10], although inclusion bodies may still form in the periplasm [11,12]. The E. coli periplasm is an oxidizing environment that contains a series of chaperones or enzymes promoting the appropriate folding of proteins [13,14,15,16]. Some E. coli periplasmic proteins such as DegP and FkpA participate in the folding of certain secreted recombinant proteins [17,18,19]. Finally, increasing the concentration of chaperones in a heat-shock system regulated by s 32 in E. coli has been shown to assist in the correct folding of the target protein [20,21,22], and co-expression of DnaK-DnaJ can greatly increase the soluble proportion of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm [22].",

            "text": "Recombinant antibodies are indispensable for research, diagnostics, and therapeutics [1][2][3]. Recombinant antibody fragments, e.g., single-chain variable fragments (scFv) and fragment antigen-binding (Fab), have advantages for research and testing [4], because they can be tailored using protein engineering approaches to add desired functions [5]. The small size and monomeric nature of scFvs have led to their broad application, including penetration of tumors [6] and genetic and chemical modification [7]. \n\nAntibody fragments, mainly scFvs, can be expressed in microbial systems that are more suitable for large-scale expression than mammalian cells [8,9]. The gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli is the most widely used system for production of recombinant proteins, with cytoplasmic expression yields sometimes reaching more than 10 g/L. The expression of recombinant antibody fragments in the reducing cytoplasmic compartment mostly results in non-functional aggregates. Functional antibody fragments can sometimes be recovered from cytoplasmic inclusion bodies by refolding [10,11], but this method is not applicable to a variety of antibody fragments. Many functional antibody fragments are expressed in the oxidizing environment of the periplasmic space of E. coli, which allows correct formation of disulfide bonds [12]. \n\nPeriplasmic secretion can be achieved by fusing the signal sequence for E. coli proteins onto the N-terminus of the antibody sequence, e.g., pectate lyase B (pelB) and outer membrane protein A (OmpA) [13,14]. However, the small volume of the periplasmic space limits the yield of antibody fragments. To achieve higher expression yields, further improvements are needed.

To avoid codon usage problems, either cells contained plasmid pUBS520 (28) in the case of full-length PABPN1, or CodonPlus RP (Stratagene) cells were used for the truncated variants. Recombinant cDNA of full-length PABPN1 variants was in vector pET11a (Novagen). Coding fragments for truncated PABPN1 variants were amplified from this vector and ligated into pET SUMOadapt (29). Recombinant protein production was performed by fermentation in complex medium in a 10-liter bioreactor (BIOSTAT C-DCU; Sartorius Stedim) as described previously (30) with the following modifications: at A 600 \u03ed 40 -50, protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl 1-thio-\u2424-D-galactopyranoside. The cultivation temperature was reduced to 30 \u00b0C to prevent inclusion body formation. Purification of fulllength PABPN1 was performed essentially according to a published protocol (31); elution of PABPN1 variants from Blue-Sepharose was achieved by a step gradient with 1 M L-arginine. Truncated PABPN1 variants were expressed as fusions with N-terminal His-SUMO which allowed purification via HisTrap FF crude (GE Healthcare) (5 ml). Fusion proteins were eluted by linear gradients from 20 to 250 mM imidazole in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol at a flow rate of 2 ml/min.",

            "text": "With the sequencing of the human genome completed and with mRNA/cDNA identification rapidly progressing, many potential novel genes have been discovered and attention has turned to the function and structure of the predicted proteins [1][2][3][4]. In order to study these novel gene products, sufficient amounts of protein generally obtained through recombinant protein expression are required. The (high-throughput) expression and characterisation of unknown and poorly characterised human proteins is a main objective of recombinant proteomic studies today.\n\nEscherichia coli is the most commonly used prokaryotic expression system for the high-level production of recombinant proteins in vivo [5] and has already been used successfully in high-throughput protein expression and purification studies [4,6]. The use of E. coli has many advantages, including the ease of growth and manipulation of the organism and the availability of many different vectors and host strains that have been developed over the years. However, the use of E. coli also has limitations, such as the aggregation of protein in insoluble inclusion bodies, problems with the expression of gene products toxic to the physiology of the host cell or proteolytic degradation of proteins in the cytoplasm [7]. In light of these difficulties, cell-free expression systems are becoming increasingly popular [8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. The in vitro systems have several advantages, including rapid protein synthesis [15], the possibility to express toxic gene products [16] and constructs that otherwise would be proteolytically degraded. Furthermore, it is possible to express proteins with up to 10 putative transmembrane domains as reported recently [17]. The compatibility with PCR-generated templates as well as plasmids allows the in vitro expression reaction with E. coli extract to be optimised using silent mutations within PCR products [18]. These sequence optimisations reduce unfavourable secondary structures in mRNA and thus improve the success rate of translation and protein expression. In contrast, for cellfree protein expression with wheat germ lysate sequence optimisation is not necessary because of the eukaryotic nature of this source.\n\nFor protein expression analyses, a comprehensive cDNA collection",

However, overexpression of genes of interest with multi-copy plasmids often causes detrimental effects on host cells. To overcome this problem, chromosomal integration of target genes has been used for decades; however, insufficient protein expression occurred with this method. In this study, we developed a novel cloning and expression system named the chromosomal vector (ChroV) system, that has features of stable and high expression of target genes on the F\u2032 plasmid in the Escherichia coli JM109(DE3) strain. We used an RMT cluster (KCTC 11994BP) containing a silent cat gene from a previous study to clone a gene into the F\u2032 plasmid. The ChroV system was applied to clone two model targets, GFPuv and carotenoids gene clusters (4 kb), and successfully used to prove the inducible tightly regulated protein expression in the F\u2032 plasmid. In addition, we verified that the expression of heterologous genes in ChroV system maintained stably in the absence of antibiotics for 1 week, indicating ChroV system is applicable to antibiotics-free production of valuable proteins. This protocol can be widely applied to recombinant protein expression for antibiotics-free, stable, and genome-based expression, providing a new platform for recombinant protein synthesis in E. coli. Overall, our approach can be widely used for the economical and industrial production of proteins in E. coli.",

            "text": "Currently the most commonly used bacterial host for industrial production of heterologous proteins is Escherichia coli. Advantages of its use as a production host for proteins are that it can be grown easily in large fermentations, and that it is genetically amenable and able to produce large quantities of proteins. However, in E. coli the produced proteins usually accumulate within the cells where they have a high potential to aggregate, resulting in the formation of inclusion bodies. To acquire the protein, the inclusion bodies need to be separated from the cell and the proteins subsequently need to be recovered from the inclusion bodies. Moreover, the outer membrane of E. coli, and of Gram-negative bacteria in general, contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS or endotoxin), which is highly pyrogenic and needs to be totally removed before the produced proteins can be used for clinical purposes. \n\nB. subtilis has excellent fermentation capacities that are equal to, if not better, than those of E. coli. In addition, B. subtilis is also capable of producing large quantities of proteins. However, in contrast to E. coli, B. subtilis lacks an outer membrane and is able to secrete proteins directly into the medium. Therefore, the secreted proteins can be purified easily from the medium in their active form, which simplifies the downstream processing considerably. Although most of the proteins that are commercially produced by B. subtilis are secreted into the medium, there are also successful examples of cytoplasmic protein production in B. subtilis [15]. Like all living organisms, B. subtilis has cellular quality control systems. These facilitate the production of high quality proteins, and remove misfolded and incompletely synthesized proteins [16,17]. Unfortunately, cellular quality control systems also represent significant bottlenecks in heterologous protein production [18,19]. This poses a fascinating challenge for cell factory engineering since inactivation of quality control systems can improve protein production yields, but these improved yields might be at the expense of product quality. Clearly, a reduced product quality would be an unwanted effect, especially if the product is a biopharmaceutical.",

Although many recombinant proteins have been successfully obtained from common prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts, these systems result to be often unproductive due to the peculiar properties of the protein to be produced. Incorrect folding of the nascent polypeptide chains is one of the main problems occurring during heterologous protein production in bacteria. Since formation of inclusion bodies often impairs the recombinant production of valuable proteins, many experimental approaches have been explored to minimize this undesirable effect [1,2]. Expression of \"difficult\" proteins has also been carried out by lowering the temperature at the physiological limit allowed for the growth of mesophilic host organisms (between 15 and 18\u00b0C for Escherichia coli). Lowering the temperature, in fact, has a pleiotropic effect on the folding process, destabilising the hydrophobic interactions needed for intermediates aggregation [3]. On the basis of the above considerations, a rational alternative to mesophilic organisms is the use of naturally cold-adapted bacteria as hosts for protein production at low temperature (even at around 0\u00b0C).",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins are currently used in different biotechnological industries and are produced in large amounts in bioreactors [1]. An important step in recombinant protein production is to choose the ideal expression system and factors like protein quality, functionality, production speed, and yield should be considered [2]. Escherichia coli has been widely used for the production of recombinant proteins due to its fast growth at high cell densities, minimal nutrient requirements, well-characterized genetics, and the availability of a large number of cloning vectors [2,3]. In the early 1980s, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first recombinant insulin produced in E. coli [4] and since then this bacterium is one of the organisms of choice for the production of several commercial recombinant proteins [5]. \n\nMost of the research on the expression of recombinant proteins has been based on planktonic bacteria grown in liquid cultures. However, the natural state for many bacteria is to live in communities of sessile cells forming biofilms [6]. Biofilms are communities of surface-attached microorganisms encased in a self-produced extracellular matrix [7]. Such biological organization provides distinct characteristics to bacteria compared to their planktonic counterparts [8]. For instance, local environmental conditions arising as a result of mass transport limitations, intercellular signaling, and other phenomena, may induce biofilm cells to modulate expression of genes differently than in suspended populations [9]. The expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli is commonly accomplished by inserting the gene of interest into a multicopy plasmid [10] that imposes a metabolic burden on the host cell [11]. In planktonic cells, this added metabolic burden may decrease cellular growth rates and biomass yields [11], particularly when the plasmid vector is used for the direct production of a recombinant protein [12]. Conjugative [13][14][15][16][17] and non-conjugative plasmids [18][19][20][21] were shown to increase biofilm formation.",

            "text": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play important roles in metabolising endogenous and xenobiotic substances. Characterisations of human CYP proteins have been advanced with the rapid development of molecular technology that allows heterologous expression of human CYPs. Among several hosts, bacteria systems such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) have been widely used thanks to their ease of use, high level of protein yields, and affordable maintenance costs. However, the levels of expression in E. coli reported in the literature sometimes differ significantly. This paper aims to review several contributing factors, including N-terminal modifications, co-expression with a chaperon, selections of vectors and E. coli strains, bacteria culture and protein expression conditions, bacteria membrane preparations, CYP protein solubilizations, CYP protein purifications, and reconstitution of CYP catalytic systems. The common factors that would most likely lead to high expression of CYPs were identified and summarised. Nevertheless, each factor may still require careful evaluation for individual CYP isoforms to achieve a maximal expression level and catalytic activity. Recombinant E. coli systems have been evidenced as a useful tool in obtaining the ideal level of human CYP proteins, which ultimately allows for subsequent characterisations of structures and functions.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the best characterized prokaryotic host for protein expression and is used for biotechnological research worldwide [1]. Understanding the biological processes that govern protein production in E. coli will improve both expression levels and stability of recombinant proteins. \n\nReductases in the cytosol of wild type E. coli maintain cysteine in its reduced state, which makes the cytosol of common E. coli expression strains not amicable for the production of disulfide-bonded proteins. Disulfide bonds are formed by the oxidation of thiol groups; in E. coli, their formation takes place almost exclusively in the periplasm and is catalyzed by a devoted machinery [2]. However, this system is not present in the cytosol and additional genetic engineering is necessary to facilitate the formation of disulfide bonds on recombinant proteins expressed in this compartment. \n\nIn order to generate an oxidative cytosolic compartment for the expression of disulfide bonded proteins, an E. coli strain named SHuffle was genetically engineered. SHuffle strains have their disulfide bond reductase pathways disrupted, permitting the oxidation of thiols within cysteines residues, resulting in disulfide bonds. Further improvements to the fidelity of disulfide bond formation were achieved by the genomic expression of the disulfide bond isomerase DsbC, in the cytoplasm [3]. Genetic removal of thioredoxin reductase (trxB) and glutathione reductase (gor) results in cell lethality, which is suppressed by the mutation in the typical 2-Cys alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, ahpC [4]. The resulting mutant protein AhpC* has lost its ability to reduce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and has instead gained the function to reduce glutathionylated Glutaredoxin 1 (grxA) [5]. Grx1 as reduced by AhpC*, can contribute sufficient reducing power to re-cycle certain essential proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase (rnr) back to their reduced states to enable growth [6], while the thioredoxin pathway remains in its oxidized state.",

After a number of weeks, sera obtained from the host animal can then be tested for the presence of antibodies that selectively recognise the antigen. To elicit an immune response in the host animal, it is generally desirable to inject milligram quantities of the antigen. Escherichia coli-based bacterial expressions systems are commonly used to generate such recombinant proteins [18].\n\nThe intrinsic antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial peptides may prevent their expression in E. coli [19]. However, several proteins and peptides have been shown to be successful as fusion partners with antimicrobial peptides to enable their expression in E. coli [20][21][22]. The fusion protein is thought to protect the peptide from proteolytic cleavage and block the peptide's antimicrobial activity against the expression host [23]. GSL1 has previously been expressed in E. coli by N-terminally tagging the peptide with the 22 amino acid pelB leader sequence enabling secretion into the bacterial periplasmic space [11]. However, to enable antibody production it is recommended that small peptides be coupled to a carrier protein to elicit a good immune response [24]. We have previously shown the utility of using thioredoxin as a fusion partner with an antimicrobial peptide to produce recombinant protein in E. coli for antibody production [25]. We chose the expression vector pET-32a to generate N-terminally tagged his 6 -thioredoxinmature GSL1 fusion protein. The recombinant fusion protein was non-toxic to the host bacterium E. coli and protein was recovered in a soluble form. Sufficient recombinant GSL1 fusion protein was isolated and purified from E. coli in soluble form for injection into rabbits. Antibodies were obtained from rabbit sera that selectively recognised synthetic GSL1 in western blot analysis of GSL1 peptide produced in a wheat germ cell-free expression system. Our work is the first report on the successful soluble expression of recombinant GSL1 fusion protein and the generation of anti-GSL1 antibodies",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most extensively studied living organisms on earth and as such has become an instrumental model system for the understanding of a plethora of gene functions and regulations in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Moreover, E. coli also plays an invaluable role in modern biological engineering and industrial microbiology: it is a very versatile host for the production of heterologous proteins and their mass-production in industrial fermentation systems. Genetically modified E. coli cells are currently used in a wide range of processes, such as vaccine development, bioremediation, production of biofuels and production of immobilized enzymes. Additional biotechnological applications are expected to be developed thanks to the exploitation of modern techniques of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. \n\nTo fully exploit the use of synthetic biology in E. coli, the availability of efficient genome editing systems, also applicable in high-throughput modalities is necessary. Currently, there are three main approaches for manipulation of chromosomal DNA in E. coli, all utilizing phage recombinase-mediated homologous recombination (recombineering), using either the Rac prophage system [1,2] or the three bacteriophage \u03bb Red proteins Exo, Beta, and Gam [3][4][5]. Classically, gene knockout mutants are created by inserting antibiotic resistance markers (or other selection markers) between double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) PCR products derived from the upstream and downstream regions of the target gene. Mutant colonies are isolated in the appropriate selective medium after transformation with linear or circular constructs and, when necessary, the selection marker is subsequently eliminated by counter-selection, leaving a \"scarless\" chromosomal mutation. Court and co-workers elegantly demonstrated that chromosomal gene mutations can be achieved without the need of selection markers and using synthetic single stranded DNAs (ss-DNAs) or ds-DNAs, which anneal to their complementary chromosomal regions during replication and mediate recombination and gene modification [6,7].",

To characterize such proteins biochemically and structurally, it is important to obtain substantial amounts of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative \u03b3-proteobacterium, is the most commonly used host bacterium for the largescale production of recombinant proteins. However, the expression and isolation of all the proteins in E. coli is difficult on account of the problems of insolubility, cytotoxicity, post-translational modifications, or inefficient translation.\n\nIn order to overcome these problems, host-vector systems other than E. coli have also been developed in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Bacillus spp. (e.g., B. brevis and B. subtilis) and Lactococcus lactis are Gram-positive bacteria with low G + C content and are often used to secrete expressed proteins into the culture media [1][2][3][4][5].\n\nSecretion prevents the local accumulation of the recombinant proteins and this occasionally aids in correct protein folding [6]. Bacillus brevis has an extremely high capacity of protein secretion and is being used for the expression of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins on an industrial scale [2]. Lactococcus lactis can also be used for the secretion of recombinant proteins and these proteins can be used directly in food applications [5]. Eukaryotic cells such as yeast cells, insect cells, or immortalized cell lines are particularly useful for the expression of proteins that undergo post-translational modifications [7].\n\nIn actinomycetes (Gram-positive bacteria with a high G + C content), the genera Streptomyces, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium, and Mycobacterim have received an increasing amount of attention, particularly in the industrial fields. They exhibit potential advantages in the synthesis of secondary metabolites of industrial and medical importance, in the production of amino acids by fermentation, and in bioconversion processes.

            "text": "For many reasons Escherichia coli is still the preferred choice as a host system for protein production. With relatively low costs one can achieve high biomass and high protein yield in only short cultivation times. Furthermore, E. coli is extremely well-studied in its biochemical and physiological characteristics. With a wealth of tools available E. coli also can be easily adapted as needed by genetic manipulation. However, even though the general procedure for protein production is straightforward, protein aggregation during expression is still a major obstacle. Different approaches are commonly applied to address this problem, and to optimize protein folding while maximizing protein expression. The currently available expression systems with their advantages and pitfalls have been regularly reviewed [1][2][3][4]. A smart combination of the different parts of the system (e.g. prokaryotic or eukaryotic host organism, type of plasmid with its specific features) can lead to an improved expression. Additional conventional approaches for protein expression optimization are the coexpression of chaperons, use of codon optimized genes, alternate protein tags, change of cultivation medium, production process optimization [2,5]. The choice of the system influences the success of proper protein folding and hence the production of active, soluble protein. Even more specialized systems facing folding problems have been developed. The preexpression of Erv1p sulfhydryl oxidase and disulfide bond isomerases for example is a robust technique for the production of disulfide bonds containing proteins [6,7]. \n\nSince every protein is different, the expression and purification strategies must be defined for each single case. In their review, Gr\u00e4slund et al. [2] summarized that there are many choices to make when expressing proteins regarding all the parts of the system; e.g. selection of E. coli strain, the fusion of the protein with a His-tag or another tag, the application of a T7 RNA polymerase expression system or another regulated promoter system, and finally the choice of the medium and cultivation conditions. They published a consensus protocol which they agreed to be a good starting-point when aiming to produce a recombinant protein. Nevertheless, success is protein dependent and a robust and ever-working strategy is still missing.",

            "text": "2.1. Recombinant Expression in Escherichia coli. The target protein is usually recombinantly overexpressed in different host systems, for example, bacteria, yeast, insect, mammalian cells, or cell-free expression systems [12]. The bacteria approach is very robust and easy to work with as compared to other systems. Thus, it is probably always the first choice to be tested, if the expressed protein is active without posttranslational modifications. The recombinant expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is introduced in the following section. \n\nFigure 1 shows the flowchart of overexpression of the target proteins. The target protein gene is amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then the PCR product is ligated with the selected commercial vectors (such as the pET system from Novagen and the pBAD system from Invitrogen). The plasmids harboring the gene of interest are transformed into the competent E. coli cells by either chemical preparation or electroporation. Chemically prepared competent cells are more widely used and work well in most cases for penetration of the plasmids. Expression of the target proteins is usually started from the cells grown in one single colony. The culture is grown until it reaches a certain phase. Afterwards, it is induced to produce the target protein by certain chemicals depending on the choice of the plasmids and strains. All factors, for example, choices of plasmids, strains, expression conditions, and fusion tags, affect the yield of the production, which further influence the down streamed purification and crystallization steps. Only the choice of strains and expression conditions are discussed here. A more complete discussion of the factors can be found elsewhere (e.g., [13]). \n\n(A) Strain. Many different strains exist and they have their own advantages. For membrane protein, C41 and C43 (both from the BL21DE3 strain) should be considered, since these derivatives not only have a slower transcription level [14,15], but also increase the size of the area to possibly accommodate a larger amount of target proteins [16]. The original BL21DE3 and the newly designed Lemo21DE3 strains [14] are worth testing as well.",

Robust protein production in the hosts and efficient downstream purification are two critical factors that could significantly reduce cost for microbial protein production by fermentation. Producing proteins/peptides as inclusion bodies in the hosts has the potential to achieve both high titers in fermentation and cost-effective downstream purification. Manipulation of the host cells such as overexpression/deletion of certain genes could lead to producing more and/or denser inclusion bodies. However, there are limited screening methods to help to identify beneficial genetic changes rendering more protein production and/or denser inclusion bodies.ResultsWe report development and optimization of a simple density gradient method that can be used for distinguishing and sorting E. coli cells with different buoyant densities. We demonstrate utilization of the method to screen genetic libraries to identify a) expression of glyQS loci on plasmid that increased expression of a peptide of interest as well as the buoyant density of inclusion body producing E. coli cells; and b) deletion of a host gltA gene that increased the buoyant density of the inclusion body produced in the E. coli cells.ConclusionA novel density gradient sorting method was developed to screen genetic libraries. Beneficial host genetic changes could be exploited to improve recombinant protein expression as well as downstream protein purification.",

Choosing the right system depends, among other things, on the growth rate and culture of host cells, level of the target gene expression and posttranslational processing of the synthesized protein. Regardless of the type of expression system, its basic elements are the vector and the expression host. The most widely used system for protein overproduction, both on a laboratory and industrial scale, is the prokaryotic system. This system is based primarily on the bacteria E. coli, although increasingly often Bacillus species are used. The prokaryotic system allows one to obtain large quantities of recombinant proteins in a short time. A simple and inexpensive bacterial cell culture and well-known mechanisms of transcription and translation facilitate the use of these microorganisms. The simplicity of genetic modifications and the availability of many bacterial mutants are additional advantages of the prokaryotic system. In this article we characterize the structural elements of prokaryotic expression vectors. Also strategies for preparation of the target protein gene that increase productivity, facilitate detection and purification of recombinant protein and provide its activity are discussed. Bacterial strains often used as host cells in expression systems as well as the potential location of heterologous proteins are characterized. Knowledge of the basic elements of the prokaryotic expression system allows for production of biologically active proteins in a short time and in satisfactory quantities.",

            "text": "Restricting the work to culture-depended approaches, neglects the large majority of RubisCO gene clusters from uncultured organisms. However, working with metagenomes in non-native systems holds both promise and pitfalls. The benefits of using E. coli as a host organism are well-known: E. coli has an unrivaled fast growth on inexpensive media and the genetics are very well-known, making transformations with exogenous DNA simple and straightforward (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). In contrast, expression of a metagenomic fragment in a surrogate host may also entail cross-talks, inhibitions and unspecific reactions. Recombinant gene expression in E. coli and other surrogate hosts might be troublesome due to, e.g., unrecognized intrinsic promotors and associated factors, a diverging codon usage or problems with correct protein folding (Perner et al., 2011).\n\nOne major advantage of working with a metagenomic fragment in fosmid clones (besides gaining access to the world of the unculturables) is its relatively small size (in this case: 13 kb metagenomic fragment). The small size infers clear gene arrangements and a limited number of possible gene and/or protein interactions relative to the (hardly tangible) complexity in a native system. The same work in a cultured representative is considerably more difficult and time consuming, because genes with yet unknown functions, which are not necessarily located in the vicinity of the gene cluster under investigation, may well participate in/contribute to the gene regulation and activation of the enzyme (indirectly), as has recently been shown for orf06 (B\u00f6hnke and Perner, 2015). Although the metagenomic approach with a defined number of genes can simplify first insights into regulatory mechanisms, it can also hinder the understanding of the mechanisms given that some vital genes/respective products cannot be expressed/synthesized as they are located on parts of the genome not present on the captured fraction of the metagenome.\n\nTo overcome such limitations the use of a host with the genomic inventory to operate the CBB cycle may be a viable option. In our case a cultured Thiomicrospira strain could be used and the genes under investigation deleted. However, deleti",

However, the secretion machinery of E. coli has a limited capacity and can become overloaded, leading to cytoplasmic retention of product; which can negatively impact cell viability and biomass accumulation. Fine control over recombinant gene expression offers the potential to avoid this overload by matching expression levels to the host secretion capacity.ResultsHere we report the application of the RiboTite gene expression control system to achieve this by finely controlling cellular expression levels. The level of control afforded by this system allows cell viability to be maintained, permitting production of high-quality, active product with enhanced volumetric titres.ConclusionsThe methods and systems reported expand the tools available for the production of disulfide-bond containing proteins, including antibody fragments, in bacterial hosts.",

With different combinations of the 20 common amino acids and some modifications of these amino acids, proteins have evolved with a staggering array of new functions and capabilities due to Protein Engineering techniques. The practical course presented was offered to undergraduate bioengineering and chemical students at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (Portugal) and consists of sequential laboratory sessions to learn the basic skills related to the expression and purification of recombinant proteins in bacterial hosts. These experiments were successfully applied by students as all working groups were able to isolate a model recombinant protein (the enhanced green fluorescent protein) from a cell lysate containing a mixture of proteins and other biomolecules produced by an Escherichia coli strain and evaluate the performance of the extraction and purification procedures they learned. Abstract Protein Engineering is a highly evolved field of engineering aimed at developing proteins for specific industrial, medical, and research applications. Here, we present a practical teaching course to demonstrate fundamental techniques used to express, purify and analyze a recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli\u2014the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The methodologies used for eGFP production were introduced sequentially over six laboratory sessions and included (i) bacterial growth, (ii) sonication (for cell lysis), (iii) affinity chromatography and dialysis (for eGFP purification), (iv) bicinchoninic acid (BCA) and fluorometry assays for total protein and eGFP quantification, respectively, and (v) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for qualitative analysis. All groups were able to isolate the eGFP from the cell lysate with purity levels up to 72%. Additionally, a mass balance analysis performed by the students showed that eGFP yields up to 46% were achieved at the end of the purification process following the adopted procedures.

These proteins are produced in the eukaryotic or prokaryotic heterologous hosts. By increasing the omics data especially related to different heterologous hosts as well as the presence of new amenable genetic engineering tools, we can artificially engineer heterologous hosts to produce recombinant proteins in sufficient quantities. Numerous recombinant proteins have been produced and applied in various industries, and the global recombinant proteins market size is expected to be cast to reach USD 2.4 billion by 2027. Therefore, identifying the weakness and strengths of heterologous hosts is critical to optimize the large-scale biosynthesis of recombinant proteins. E. coli is one of the popular hosts to produce recombinant proteins. Scientists reported some bottlenecks in this host, and due to the increasing demand for the production of recombinant proteins, there is an urgent need to improve this host. In this review, we first provide general information about the E. coli host and compare it with other hosts. In the next step, we describe the factors involved in the expression of the recombinant proteins in E. coli . Successful expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli requires a complete elucidation of these factors. Here, the characteristics of each factor will be fully described, and this information can help to improve the heterologous expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli .",

In this scenario, some of the parameters to be optimized include (i) those related to the protein construct, such as the use of a fusion protein, the choice of an N-terminus fusion/tag or a C-terminus fusion/tag; (ii) those related to the expression stage, such as the concentration and selection of inducer agent and temperature expression and (iii) the choice of the host system, which includes the selection of a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell and the adoption of a strain. The optimization of some of the parameters related to protein expression, stage (ii), is straightforward. On the other hand, the determination of the most suitable parameters related to protein construction requires a new cycle of gene cloning, while the optimization of the host cell is less straightforward. Here, we evaluated a scalable approach for the screening of host cells for protein expression in a structural biology pipeline. We evaluated four Escherichia coli strains looking for the best yield of soluble heterologous protein expression using the same strategy for protein construction and gene cloning and comparing it to our standard strain, Rosetta 2 (DE3). Using a liquid handling device (robot), E. coli pT-GroE, Lemo21(DE3), Arctic Express (DE3), and Rosetta Gami 2 (DE3) strains were screened for the maximal yield of soluble heterologous protein recovery. For the genes used in this experiment, the Arctic Express (DE3) strain resulted in better yields of soluble heterologous proteins.

Recombinant protein importance is represented by its market size, which reached $1654 million in 2016 and is expected to reach $2850.5 million by 2022. Among the available hosts, yeasts have been used for producing a great variety of proteins applied to chemicals, fuels, food, and pharmaceuticals, being one of the most used hosts for recombinant production nowadays. Historically, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the dominant yeast host for heterologous protein production. Lately, other yeasts such as Komagataella sp., Kluyveromyces lactis, and Yarrowia lipolytica have emerged as advantageous hosts. In this review, a comparative analysis is done listing the advantages and disadvantages of using each host regarding the availability of genetic tools, strategies for cultivation in bioreactors, and the main techniques utilized for protein purification.

Escherichia coli as a host organism is widely used in recombinant DNA technology because of its well-studied genome and high efficiency culture on a large scale. Although E.coli enables the production of valuable foreign proteins at high expression rates and high concentrations, the expression of proteins in E. coli often leads to the formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) which contain a high proportion of the recombinant proteins in incorrect steric structures without the desired biological activities [20]. In our work, SDS-PAGE analyses showed that the target NHases were successfully expressed in E. coli (Figure 2a), but there was a large part of IBs that appeared in the form of fragments in the E. coli Arctic Expression (DE3) and BL21 (DE3) (Figure 2b). In our future work, we will construct the recombinant ReNHase with fusion tags (such as NT tag, MBP tag, PGB1 tag and SUMO tag) to eliminate the proportion of IBs. These fusion tags have contributed to increased protein solubility and expression level, which have been proved to promote recombinant protein expressions [21]. \n\nSince the discovery of the first NHase from Arthrobacter sp. J1 in 1980, many NHase-producing strains belonging to the genera Pseudomonas, Serratia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium, Nocardia, Pseudonocardia, etc. have been isolated from the natural environment [22]. Rhodococcus has been the main source of new NHases up to now. However, the regioselectivity of different Rhodococcus strains may vary, which can be adapted to different industrial needs [18].",

            "abstract": "Escherichia coli is the most widely used bacterium in prokaryotic expression system for the production of recombinant proteins. In BL21 (DE3), the gene encoding the T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) is under control of the strong lacUV5 promoter (P lacUV5 ), which is leakier and more active than wild-type lac promoter (P lacWT ) under certain growth conditions. These characteristics are not advantageous for the production of those recombinant proteins with toxic or growth-burdened. On the one hand, leakage expression of T7 RNAP leads to rapid production of target proteins under non-inducing period, which sucks resources away from cellular growth. Moreover, in non-inducing or inducing period, high expression of T7 RNAP production leads to the high-production of hard-to-express proteins, which may all lead to loss of the expression plasmid or the occurrence of mutations in the expressed gene. Therefore, more BL21 (DE3)-derived variant strains with rigorous expression and different expression level of T7 RNAP should be developed. Hence, we replaced P lacUV5 with other inducible promoters respectively, including arabinose promoter (P araBAD ), rhamnose promoter (P rhaBAD ), tetracycline promoter (P tet ), in order to optimize the production of recombinant protein by regulating the transcription level and the leakage level of T7 RNAP. Compared with BL21 (DE3), the constructed engineered strains had higher sensitivity to inducers, among which rhamnose and tetracycline promoters had the lowest leakage ability. In the production of glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), a protein that causes host autolysis, the engineered strain BL21 (DE3::ara) exhibited higher biomass, cell survival rate and foreign protein expression level than that of BL21 (DE3). In addition, these engineered strains had been successfully applied to improve the production of membrane proteins, including E. coli cytosine transporter protein (CodB), the E. coli membrane protein insertase/foldase (YidC), and the E. coli F-ATPase subunit b (Ecb).

            "text": "Escherichia coli is the most widely used bacterium in prokaryotic expression system for the production of recombinant proteins. In BL21 (DE3), the gene encoding the T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) is under control of the strong lacUV5 promoter (P lacUV5 ), which is leakier and more active than wild-type lac promoter (P lacWT ) under certain growth conditions. These characteristics are not advantageous for the production of those recombinant proteins with toxic or growth-burdened. On the one hand, leakage expression of T7 RNAP leads to rapid production of target proteins under non-inducing period, which sucks resources away from cellular growth. Moreover, in non-inducing or inducing period, high expression of T7 RNAP production leads to the high-production of hard-to-express proteins, which may all lead to loss of the expression plasmid or the occurrence of mutations in the expressed gene. Therefore, more BL21 (DE3)-derived variant strains with rigorous expression and different expression level of T7 RNAP should be developed.

            "abstract": "Sugar nucleotide\u2010dependent (Leloir) glycosyltransferases from plants are important catalysts for the glycosylation of small molecules and natural products. Limitations on their applicability for biocatalytic synthesis arise because of low protein expression (\u226410\u2009mg/L culture) in standard microbial hosts. Here, we showed two representative glycosyltransferases: sucrose synthase from soybean and UGT71A15 from apple. A synthetic biology\u2010based strategy of decoupling the enzyme expression from the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cell growth was effective in enhancing their individual (approximately fivefold) or combined (approximately twofold) production as correctly folded, biologically active proteins. The approach entails a synthetic host cell, which is able to shut down the production of host messenger RNA by inhibition of the E. coli RNA polymerase. Overexpression of the enzyme(s) of interest is induced by the orthogonal T7 RNA polymerase. Shutting down of the host RNA polymerase is achieved by l\u2010arabinose\u2010inducible expression of the T7 phage\u2010derived Gp2 protein from a genome\u2010integrated site. The glycosyltransferase genes are encoded on conventional pET\u2010based expression plasmids that allow T7 RNA polymerase\u2010driven inducible expression by isopropyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010 d\u2010galactoside. Laboratory batch and scaled\u2010up (20\u2009L) fed\u2010batch bioreactor cultivations demonstrated improvements in an overall yield of active enzyme by up to 12\u2010fold as a result of production under growth\u2010decoupled conditions.

            "text": "Sugar nucleotide\u2010dependent (Leloir) glycosyltransferases from plants are important catalysts for the glycosylation of small molecules and natural products. Limitations on their applicability for biocatalytic synthesis arise because of low protein expression (\u226410\u2009mg/L culture) in standard microbial hosts. Here, we showed two representative glycosyltransferases: sucrose synthase from soybean and UGT71A15 from apple. A synthetic biology\u2010based strategy of decoupling the enzyme expression from the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cell growth was effective in enhancing their individual (approximately fivefold) or combined (approximately twofold) production as correctly folded, biologically active proteins. The approach entails a synthetic host cell, which is able to shut down the production of host messenger RNA by inhibition of the E. coli RNA polymerase. Overexpression of the enzyme(s) of interest is induced by the orthogonal T7 RNA polymerase. Shutting down of the host RNA polymerase is achieved by l\u2010arabinose\u2010inducible expression of the T7 phage\u2010derived Gp2 protein from a genome\u2010integrated site. The glycosyltransferase genes are encoded on conventional pET\u2010based expression plasmids that allow T7 RNA polymerase\u2010driven inducible expression by isopropyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010 d\u2010galactoside. Laboratory batch and scaled\u2010up (20\u2009L) fed\u2010batch bioreactor cultivations demonstrated improvements in an overall yield of active enzyme by up to 12\u2010fold as a result of production under growth\u2010decoupled conditions. In batch culture, sucrose synthase and UGT71A15 were obtained, respectively, at 115 and 2.30 U/g cell dry weight, corresponding to \u223c5 and \u223c1% of total intracellular protein.

Here, we present a novel approach for improved recombinant protein production (RPP) using Escherichia coli (E. coli) by decoupling recombinant protein synthesis from cell growth. We show that cell division and host mRNA transcription can be successfully inhibited by co-expression of a bacteriophage-derived E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibitor peptide and that genes over-transcribed by the orthogonal T7 RNAP can finally account to > 55 % of cell dry mass (CDM). This RNAP inhibitor peptide binds the E. coli RNAP and therefore prevents \u03c3-factor 70 mediated formation of transcriptional qualified open promoter complexes. Thereby, the transcription of \u03c3-factor 70 driven host genes is inhibited, and metabolic resources can be exclusively utilized for synthesis of the protein of interest (POI). Here, we mimic the late phase of bacteriophage infection by co-expressing a phage-derived xenogeneic regulator that reprograms the host cell and thereby are able to significantly improve RPP under industrial relevant fed-batch process conditions at bioreactor scale. We have evaluated production of several different recombinant proteins at different scales (from microscale to 20 L fed-batch scale) and have been able to improve total and soluble proteins yields up to 3.4-fold in comparison to the reference expression system E. coli BL21(DE3). This novel approach for growth-decoupled RPP has profound implications for biotechnology and bioengineering and helps to establish more cost-effective and generic manufacturing processes for biologics and biomaterials.",

However, many of the commercial vectors encoding different solubility tags require different cloning and purification steps for each vector, considerably slowing down expression screening. We have developed a set of E. coli expression vectors with different solubility tags that allow for parallel cloning from a single PCR product and can be purified using the same protocol.ResultsThe set of E. coli expression vectors, encode for either a hexa-histidine tag or the three most commonly used solubility tags (GST, MBP, NusA) and all with an N-terminal hexa-histidine sequence. The result is two-fold: the His-tag facilitates purification by immobilised metal affinity chromatography, whilst the fusion domains act primarily as solubility aids during expression, in addition to providing an optional purification step. We have also incorporated a TEV recognition sequence following the solubility tag domain, which allows for highly specific cleavage (using TEV protease) of the fusion protein to yield native protein. These vectors are also designed for ligation-independent cloning and they possess a high-level expressing T7 promoter, which is suitable for auto-induction. To validate our vector system, we have cloned four different genes and also one gene into all four vectors and used small-scale expression and purification techniques. We demonstrate that the vectors are capable of high levels of expression and that efficient screening of new proteins can be readily achieved at the laboratory level.ConclusionThe result is a set of four rationally designed vectors, which can be used for streamlined cloning, expression and purification of target proteins in the laboratory and have the potential for being adaptable to a high-throughput screening."

To increase our knowledge of the biological functions of PTHrP, the prokaryotic expression vector pET-PTHrP was successfully constructed and the His-PTHrP fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. Anti-PTHrP polyclonal antibody was then prepared from rabbits. Finally, the goat tissue expression profile of PTHrP was analyzed by Western blot with the anti-PTHrP polyclonal antibody. The results showed that the expression of PTHrP in goat mammary glands was significantly higher than that in other organs. This indicates that PTHrP may play important roles in the goat mammary gland. The antibody prepared will be a useful tool for detecting PTHrP and will be valuable in future studies investigating the role of PTHrP in calcium metabolism in the goat model.",

There is an expanding choice of tightly regulated prokaryotic promoters suitable for achieving high-level gene expression. New host strains facilitate the formation of disulfide bonds in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm and offer higher protein yields by minimizing proteolytic degradation. Insights into the process of protein translocation across the bacterial membranes may eventually make it possible to achieve robust secretion of specific proteins into the culture medium. Studies involving molecular chaperones have shown that in specific cases, chaperones can be very effective for improved protein folding, solubility, and membrane transport. Negative results derived from such studies are also instructive in formulating different strategies. The remarkable increase in the availability of fusion partners offers a wide range of tools for improved protein folding, solubility, protection from proteases, yield, and secretion into the culture medium, as well as for detection and purification of recombinant proteins. Codon usage is known to present a potential impediment to high-level gene expression in E. coli. Although we still do not understand all the rules governing this phenomenon, it is apparent that \"rare\" codons, depending on their frequency and context, can have an adverse effect on protein levels. Usually, this problem can be alleviated by modification of the relevant codons or by coexpression of the cognate tRNA genes. Finally, the elucidation of specific determinants of protein degradation, a plethora of protease-deficient host strains, and methods to stabilize proteins afford new strategies to minimize proteolytic susceptibility of recombinant proteins in E. coli.",

There have been improvements on the transformation efficiency of 10 5\u2013 6 colonies/ \u03bcg plasmid DNA ( 2); the best probably that of Hanahan (3) yielding 107\u2013109. The highest rates are achieved using electroporation (10 9\u20131010). However, we experienced difficulties in electroporation of the repair deficient strain of Escherichia coli (BMH71-18 mut S) required in the Unique Site Mutagenesis (USE) technique ( 4) and examined factors effecting the efficiency of the calcium competent protocol. It is possible to transform cells in a fraction of the time recommended and vastly improve efficiency. Mutagenesis protocols generally rely on a high transformation efficiency, but this is not of prime concern for the majority of cloning techniques. Standard calcium chloride transformations are simple, cheap and the competent cells may be stored at 4 C or frozen at \u201370 C, whereas Hanahan cells must be used immediately and electroporating equipment is expensive. We have concentrated on three E.coli cell types, JM101 for general cloning steps, BL21(DE3) for subsequent protein expression and the repair deficient BMH71-18 mut S. Cells were grown at 37 C in 100 ml of 2xTY medium (16 g bacto tryptone, 10 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl/l pH 7.4) containing 50 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline or ampicillin where appropriate. At an A600 \u223c0.7\u20130.8 they were chilled on ice, pelleted, resuspended in half volume of 0.1 M CaCl 2, cooled on ice for 30 min, repelleted and resuspended in 5 ml 0.1 M CaCl 2 (5). Competent cells were stored at 4 C or as 100 \u03bcl aliquots in 10% glycerol at \u201370 C. The plasmid used was a 4.8 kb construct of human gelsolin cDNA in pKN172 (a 2.6 kb ampicillin resistant pET based vector) ( 6) . In the \u2018standard protocol\u2019, \u223c1\u201310 ng of DNA was mixed with 100 \u03bcl of cells, left for 30 min on ice, heat shocked to 42 C for 2\u20133 min, cooled again on ice before 500 \u03bcl antibiotic free medium was added for a 30\u201360 min outgrowth at 37 C and final plating out on selective agar plates ( 5). Using these conditions we achieved \u223c5 \u00d7 106 colonies/ \u03bcg plasmid. The effect of salt concentration on electroporation has been well documented. Calcium competent E.coli were originally transformed using DNA solutions containing 20 mM NaCl ( 7), Figure 1 shows the effect NaCl has on these transformations. Optimum volumes for transformation were 8 \u00b1 4 \u03bcl DNA for 100 \u03bcl cells. Larger volumes reduced transformation efficiency: 30 \u03bcl gave 70% of the colonies obtained using 5 \u03bcl. The length of time that cells were pre-incubated on ice with DNA was not important. JM101 cells incubated with plasmid on ice for 1\u2013180 min before heat shock showed little variation in transformant numbers; at 180 min transformation was \u223c75% of that at 5 min. Transformations with BMH71-18mutS cells were variable and often as low as 20% of those obtained from the other cell lines. Incubation of cells with the plasmid on ice followed by directly spreading onto plates at room temperature (i.e. no 42 C heat hock) was sufficient to restore the higher transformation efficiency. When this was repeated on plates pre-incubated to 37 C the efficiency was even higher. Figure 2A shows results for JM101 cells incubated with the GS construct where the plasmid/cell mixtures have been plated directly from the incubation on ice onto agar plates pre-incubated to different temperatures. By spreading directly onto plates pre-incubated to 37 C we routinely achieve double the transformation efficiencies of the \u2018standard protocol\u2019. Once heat shocked to 42 C as in the standard transformation protocol, there is an indifference to the pre-incubation temperature of the plates (Fig. 2B). This figure also demonstrates that cells give higher transformation rates following 3\u20134 days storage at 4 C and can be used for periods of up to 2 weeks for simple transformation of plasmid, although in agreement with Dagert and Ehrlich\u2019s original observations they are best used after 24 h ( 8). Following 42 C heat shock, transformations were generally better with a 30\u201360 min 37 C non-selective medium recovery"

Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used bacterial hosts for the production of these products. A variety of recombinant proteins has been produced and cultivation studies have been carried out at small scale. However, the majority of the recombinant proteins are not amenable directly to large scale production processes due to various factors. To meet the growing demand of potential bioproducts, there is a need to produce these products in large quantity employing fermentation processes. Development of a suitable purification strategy is yet another important step to recover biologically active products.

Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium (Sezonov et al., 2007). Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes (Datsenko et al., 2000). Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation.

In this review, we describe several state-of-the-art approaches that are suitable for the cloning, expression and purification, conducted in parallel, of numerous molecules, and we discuss recent progress related to soluble protein expression, mRNA folding, fusion tags, post-translational modification and production of membrane proteins. Moreover, we address the ongoing efforts to overcome various challenges faced in protein expression in E. coli, which could lead to an improvement of the current system from trial and error to a predictable and rational design.",

In this procedure, recombination requires the phage lambda Red recombinase, which is synthesized under the control of an inducible promoter on an easily curable, low copy number plasmid. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we generated PCR products by using primers with 36- to 50-nt extensions that are homologous to regions adjacent to the gene to be inactivated and template plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes that are flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites. By using the respective PCR products, we made 13 different disruptions of chromosomal genes. Mutants of the arcB, cyaA, lacZYA, ompR-envZ, phnR, pstB, pstCA, pstS, pstSCAB-phoU, recA, and torSTRCAD genes or operons were isolated as antibiotic-resistant colonies after the introduction into bacteria carrying a Red expression plasmid of synthetic (PCR-generated) DNA. The resistance genes were then eliminated by using a helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase which is also easily curable. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome analysis of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done in wild-type cells."

The results demonstrated that the resultant leaky strains were genetically stable and had a similar growth profile in the complex media as compared with the original strain, and the secretory levels of target proteins into Modified R media from the strains with double\u2010gene deletion (up to 88.9%/mrcA lpp\u2010pth) are higher than the excretory levels from the strains with single\u2010gene deletion (up to 71.1%/lpp\u2010pth) and the host E.\u2009coli\u2005JM109 (DE3) (near zero).

This fact indicates that despite the diverse bottlenecks and obstacles that microbial systems pose to the efficient production of functional mammalian proteins, namely lack or unconventional post-translational modifications, proteolytic instability, poor solubility and activation of cell stress responses, among others, they represent convenient and powerful tools for recombinant protein production. The entering into the market of a progressively increasing number of protein drugs produced in non-microbial systems has not impaired the development of products obtained in microbial cells, proving the robustness of the microbial set of cellular systems (so far Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisae) developed for protein drug production. We summarize here the nature, properties and applications of all those pharmaceuticals and the relevant features of the current and potential producing hosts, in a comparative way."

First, I should include an \"Introduction/Background\" section to provide context about E. coli as a recombinant protein expression system. This will help users understand the basic concept before diving into specific advantages.\n\n2. For the advantages themselves, I can organize them into the following dimensions:\n   - Economic advantages (cost-effectiveness, high yields)\n   - Growth characteristics (fast growth rate, high cell density)\n   - Genetic advantages (well-characterized genetics, ease of manipulation)\n   - Technical advantages (simplicity of use, availability of tools and protocols)\n   - Production advantages (protein yield, scalability, downstream processing)\n   - Industrial relevance (commercial applications, FDA-approved products)\n\nFor most of these dimensions, a synthesis format would be most appropriate since they involve explanations of related concepts rather than distinct items. This will allow me to integrate information from multiple quotes into coherent explanations of each advantage category.\n\nThe quotes clearly indicate that E. coli has numerous advantages that should be synthesized rather than listed as separate bullet points. Each dimension will draw from multiple quotes to provide a comprehensive understanding of that particular advantage category.",

This fact indicates that despite the diverse bottlenecks and obstacles that microbial systems pose to the efficient production of functional mammalian proteins, namely lack or unconventional post-translational modifications, proteolytic instability, poor solubility and activation of cell stress responses, among others, they represent convenient and powerful tools for recombinant protein production. The entering into the market of a progressively increasing number of protein drugs produced in non-microbial systems has not impaired the development of products obtained in microbial cells, proving the robustness of the microbial set of cellular systems (so far Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisae) developed for protein drug production. We summarize here the nature, properties and applications of all those pharmaceuticals and the relevant features of the current and potential producing hosts, in a comparative way."

                            "This system is the good choice for the functional expression of non-glycosylated proteins. The advantages of this system include fast growth, high cell density using simple and low cost growth medium, known genetic information, availability of a large number of expression vectors and availability of mutant host strains, simple transfer, easy control, possibility of mass production of recombinant proteins and thus cost-effectiveness. In the case of yeast and mammalian hosts, in most cases, protein production is much lower and more expensive than E. coli host is."

The rationale is clear: E. coli is easy to genetically manipulate, it is inexpensive to culture, and expression is fast, with proteins routinely produced in one day. Moreover, protocols for isotope-labeling for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine incorporation for X-ray crystallography are well established, making it highly suitable for structural studies. Thus, E. coli has multiple, significant benefits over other expression systems including cost, ease-of-use, and scale."

Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

This means that a culture inoculated with a 1/100 dilution of a saturated starter culture may reach stationary phase in a few hours.

                            "In both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media (Sezonov et al., 2007), which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium (Sezonov et al., 2007). Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes (Datsenko et al., 2000). Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics (Jia et al., 2016)[5]."

It was initially chosen as a model system because of its ability to grow on chemically defined media and its rapid growth rate. In rich media, during the log phase of its growth, E.coli doubles every 20-30min; hence, with overnight incubation period, single selected organisms will double enough times to yield a colony on an agar plate 0r 1-2 billion cells per millilitre of the liquid media.

These fine properties, in conjunction with the success achieved in transforming plasmid DNA into E. coli , as well as the advent of various genetic engineering techniques in the 1970s, have enabled E. coli to be considered as the most favorable host for genetic manipulations. The recent advances in better comprehension of regulatory controls of gene expression and the availability of various novel approaches, which include both intracellular, e.g., through intein-mediated expression and self-cleavages, and extracellular, e.g., through the use of secretion signals, to achieve successful expression of the target proteins in E. coli further support the view that E. coli is the most promising host choice for heterologous protein expression."

                            "In both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media (Sezonov et al., 2007), which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium (Sezonov et al., 2007). Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes (Datsenko et al., 2000). Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics (Jia et al., 2016)[5]."

                            "We have developed a simple and highly efficient method to disrupt chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli in which PCR primers provide the homology to the targeted gene(s). In this procedure, recombination requires the phage lambda Red recombinase, which is synthesized under the control of an inducible promoter on an easily curable, low copy number plasmid. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we generated PCR products by using primers with 36- to 50-nt extensions that are homologous to regions adjacent to the gene to be inactivated and template plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes that are flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites. By using the respective PCR products, we made 13 different disruptions of chromosomal genes. Mutants of the arcB, cyaA, lacZYA, ompR-envZ, phnR, pstB, pstCA, pstS, pstSCAB-phoU, recA, and torSTRCAD genes or operons were isolated as antibiotic-resistant colonies after the introduction into bacteria carrying a Red expression plasmid of synthetic (PCR-generated) DNA. The resistance genes were then eliminated by using a helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase which is also easily curable. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome analysis of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done in wild-type cells."

                            "BackgroundIn the past few years, both automated and manual high-throughput protein expression and purification has become an accessible means to rapidly screen and produce soluble proteins for structural and functional studies. However, many of the commercial vectors encoding different solubility tags require different cloning and purification steps for each vector, considerably slowing down expression screening. We have developed a set of E. coli expression vectors with different solubility tags that allow for parallel cloning from a single PCR product and can be purified using the same protocol.ResultsThe set of E. coli expression vectors, encode for either a hexa-histidine tag or the three most commonly used solubility tags (GST, MBP, NusA) and all with an N-terminal hexa-histidine sequence. The result is two-fold: the His-tag facilitates purification by immobilised metal affinity chromatography, whilst the fusion domains act primarily as solubility aids during expression, in addition to providing an optional purification step. We have also incorporated a TEV recognition sequence following the solubility tag domain, which allows for highly specific cleavage (using TEV protease) of the fusion protein to yield native protein. These vectors are also designed for ligation-independent cloning and they possess a high-level expressing T7 promoter, which is suitable for auto-induction. To validate our vector system, we have cloned four different genes and also one gene into all four vectors and used small-scale expression and purification techniques. We demonstrate that the vectors are capable of high levels of expression and that efficient screening of new proteins can be readily achieved at the laboratory level.ConclusionThe result is a set of four rationally designed vectors, which can be used for streamlined cloning, expression and purification of target proteins in the laboratory and have the potential for being adaptable to a high-throughput screening."

It is used to manufacture large quantities of commercialized proteins. This method is particularly outstanding for the functional expression of non-glycosylated proteins. E. coli genetics are better understood than that of any other microorganism (Zheng et al., 2013). Recent advances in the understanding of the processes involved in coding, translation, and protein folding in E. coli and the use of advanced genetic instruments render this bacterium more useful than ever for the production of diverse eukaryotic proteins (Zheng et al., 2014)[30](Zhang et al., 2004)(Zhang et al., 2009).

To increase our knowledge of the biological functions of PTHrP, the prokaryotic expression vector pET-PTHrP was successfully constructed and the His-PTHrP fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. Anti-PTHrP polyclonal antibody was then prepared from rabbits. Finally, the goat tissue expression profile of PTHrP was analyzed by Western blot with the anti-PTHrP polyclonal antibody. The results showed that the expression of PTHrP in goat mammary glands was significantly higher than that in other organs. This indicates that PTHrP may play important roles in the goat mammary gland. The antibody prepared will be a useful tool for detecting PTHrP and will be valuable in future studies investigating the role of PTHrP in calcium metabolism in the goat model."

The entering into the market of a progressively increasing number of protein drugs produced in non-microbial systems has not impaired the development of products obtained in microbial cells, proving the robustness of the microbial set of cellular systems (so far Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisae) developed for protein drug production.

In addition to its well-characterized genetics, E. coli is fast growing, relatively cheap, and easy to handle. These fine properties, in conjunction with the success achieved in transforming plasmid DNA into E. coli , as well as the advent of various genetic engineering techniques in the 1970s, have enabled E. coli to be considered as the most favorable host for genetic manipulations. The recent advances in better comprehension of regulatory controls of gene expression and the availability of various novel approaches, which include both intracellular, e.g., through intein-mediated expression and self-cleavages, and extracellular, e.g., through the use of secretion signals, to achieve successful expression of the target proteins in E. coli further support the view that E. coli is the most promising host choice for heterologous protein expression."

The rationale is clear: E. coli is easy to genetically manipulate, it is inexpensive to culture, and expression is fast, with proteins routinely produced in one day. Moreover, protocols for isotope-labeling for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine incorporation for X-ray crystallography are well established, making it highly suitable for structural studies. Thus, E. coli has multiple, significant benefits over other expression systems including cost, ease-of-use, and scale."

                            "In both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media (Sezonov et al., 2007), which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium (Sezonov et al., 2007). Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes (Datsenko et al., 2000). Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics (Jia et al., 2016)[5]."

The advantages and disadvantages are presented in Table 1. The advantages include rapid growth, fast expression, ease of cultivation, and high product yields (Zorko et al., 2009)(Zhu et al., 1999)(Zhou et al., 2009). It is used to manufacture large quantities of commercialized proteins. This method is particularly outstanding for the functional expression of non-glycosylated proteins. E. coli genetics are better understood than that of any other microorganism (Zheng et al., 2013). Recent advances in the understanding of the processes involved in coding, translation, and protein folding in E. coli and the use of advanced genetic instruments render this bacterium more useful than ever for the production of diverse eukaryotic proteins (Zheng et al., 2014)[30](Zhang et al., 2004)(Zhang et al., 2009). Its genome can be updated rapidly and reliably with ease. The regulation of promoter elements is not complex, and the number of plasmid copies can be easily adjusted."

This means that a culture inoculated with a 1/100 dilution of a saturated starter culture may reach stationary phase in a few hours. However, it should be noted that the expression of a recombinant protein may impart a metabolic burden on the microorganism, causing a considerable decrease in generation time (Bentley et al., 1990).\n\n(ii) High cell density cultures are easily achieved.

This fact indicates that despite the diverse bottlenecks and obstacles that microbial systems pose to the efficient production of functional mammalian proteins, namely lack or unconventional post-translational modifications, proteolytic instability, poor solubility and activation of cell stress responses, among others, they represent convenient and powerful tools for recombinant protein production. The entering into the market of a progressively increasing number of protein drugs produced in non-microbial systems has not impaired the development of products obtained in microbial cells, proving the robustness of the microbial set of cellular systems (so far Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisae) developed for protein drug production. We summarize here the nature, properties and applications of all those pharmaceuticals and the relevant features of the current and potential producing hosts, in a comparative way."

Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

                            "Most of the hosts used to produce the 151 recombinant pharmaceuticals so far approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) are microbial cells, either bacteria or yeast. This fact indicates that despite the diverse bottlenecks and obstacles that microbial systems pose to the efficient production of functional mammalian proteins, namely lack or unconventional post-translational modifications, proteolytic instability, poor solubility and activation of cell stress responses, among others, they represent convenient and powerful tools for recombinant protein production. The entering into the market of a progressively increasing number of protein drugs produced in non-microbial systems has not impaired the development of products obtained in microbial cells, proving the robustness of the microbial set of cellular systems (so far Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisae) developed for protein drug production. We summarize here the nature, properties and applications of all those pharmaceuticals and the relevant features of the current and potential producing hosts, in a comparative way."
