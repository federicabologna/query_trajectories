The formation of these coronas is a complex process influenced by various mechanisms involving serum proteins and other blood components.  One of the primary mechanisms driving the formation of biomolecular coronas around LNPs is the physicochemical interaction between the nanoparticles and the proteins present in biological fluids. The surface properties of LNPs, including their charge, size, and hydrophobicity, significantly influence the types of proteins that adsorb onto their surfaces. For example, Wan et al showed that the zeta potential of nanoparticles can change upon protein adsorption, indicating that electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in corona formation [0]. Additionally, the affinity of specific proteins for the nanoparticle surface can dictate the composition of the corona, with high-affinity proteins forming a \"hard\" corona that is tightly bound, while lower-affinity proteins may form a \"soft\" corona that is more loosely associated [1].\nThe dynamic nature of the biomolecular corona is another critical aspect that influences LNP behavior. The composition of the corona can change over time as the nanoparticles circulate in the bloodstream, influenced by factors such as the concentration of specific proteins and the presence of other biomolecules. This dynamic behavior can affect the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of LNPs, as different protein compositions can lead to varying biological responses [2].\n"}, {"input": "What experimental strategies can be introduced to prevent LNPs to be exclusively accumulated in the liver?", "ctxs": [{"title": "Added to pre-existing inflammation, mRNA-lipid nanoparticles induce inflammation exacerbation (IE)", "text": "To achieve redirection of the modmRNA-LNP from liver to lung tissue, we administered endothelial-targeted modmRNA-LNP (either anti-PECAM modmRNA-LNP or anti-PLVAP [plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein] modmRNA-LNP) instead of non-targeted modmRNA-LNP in the original model.

The predominant challenge with LNPs is their inherent tendency to localize in hepatic tissues due to their lipid composition and the physiological properties of the liver. However, recent advancements in nanoparticle design and targeting strategies offer promising avenues for redirecting LNP distribution to other tissues.\nOne effective approach is the modification of LNPs to enhance their targeting capabilities. For example, the incorporation of specific ligands that bind to receptors overexpressed in target tissues can facilitate active targeting. Researchers demonstrated that endothelial-targeted modmRNA-LNPs, such as those targeting PECAM or PLVAP, successfully redirected LNP accumulation from the liver to the lungs, highlighting the potential of receptor-mediated targeting strategies to alter biodistribution profiles [0].

The lipid composition, including the ratio of ionizable lipids, helper lipids, and PEGylated lipids, can significantly influence the biodistribution of LNPs. For example, altering the lipid ratios has been shown to enable more accurate transport of LNPs to various organs, including the lungs and spleen, rather than the liver [2].

In addition, the controlled release properties of polymer nanoparticles are easier to control and surface modification is convenient (47). In general, polymer nanoparticles can be divided into two categories: nanospheres and nano microcapsules. Nanospheres are \u201cmatrix type,\u201d in which drugs are dispersed throughout the matrix, while microcapsules are \u201crepository type,\u201d in which drugs are present in a core surrounded by a polymer shell. In recent years, biodegradable nanoparticles have shown great potential as drug carriers due to their good biocompatibility.\n \n However, the encapsulation rate of polymer nanoparticles is low, and due to the high molecular weight of polymer, polymer nanoparticles can easily induce immune response. To overcome these shortcomings, a new carrier system emerges out which is known as lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs). Clearly, the polymer controls the drug release and the lipid increases the loading efficiency as well as permeation. Thus, LPNs have good potential to enhance physical stability and biocompatibility (48). Zhang et al. (49) constructed a polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticle in which polyetaxel is encapsulated in the polymer core, which is encapsulated in a monolayer of lipids. Compared with pure polymer nanoparticles (37%), this system has a higher encapsulation rate (59%). In addition, the lipid-controlled release barrier on the surface of the system inhibits the burst release effect, and it takes 20 h for the mixed nanoparticles to release 50% of the drug, compared to only 7 h for the pure polymer nanoparticles. LPNs system has been explored for the oral delivery of several thrombolytic agents.

Two or more warheads or payloads are coupled to a single mAb through specific chemical linkers. Since these linkers are prone to degradation through hydrolysis, it is important to achieve stable linker stability to achieve suitable potency and efficacy of the formulated ADC modalities. Anti-cancer agents by themselves are highly toxic, and stable linkers ensure that ADCs circulate upon administration without releasing the cytotoxic warheads until they reach the target tumor cells [1]. Ideally, the stable linkers could also prevent ADC aggregations [2]. Therefore, linker stability plays a key role in the therapeutic index and pharmacokinetics of the administered ADCs.\n There are two types of linkers: cleavable and noncleavable linkers [1-4]. The former can be cleaved to release the payload in endosomes or lysosomes through various degradation mechanisms including acid degradation, protease cleave, and thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. On the other hand, noncleavable linkers can withstand these degradation mechanisms and release the payload mainly through complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the mAbs [3]. Hence designing the appropriate linker chemistry is crucial for determining the release kinetic and associated potency of the ADC-mediated delivery of anti-cancer drugs to different types of tumors.\n Additionally, unstable linker chemistry could alter the overall physicochemical properties of the ADC formulations including molecular weight, linker length, steric hindrance, half-life, and heterogeneity upon biodistribution that could lead to unfavorable therapeutic outcomes [4]."}, {"input": "What are different chemical methodologies to form ADC linkers?", "ctxs": [{"title": "Current ADC Linker Chemistry", "text": "The linker, which is the highlight of this review, needs to possess a number of key attributes, including the requirement to be stable in plasma after drug administration for an extended period of time such that the ADC can localize to tumor cells. This stability prevents the premature release of the cytotoxic payload, which would indiscriminately damage tissue of all kinds, thereby lowering the therapeutic index of the ADC. Upon internalization, the ADC should liberate the payload such that the payload can bind to its target. In addition to these two basic functions, linkers can have a profound effect on the physico-chemical properties of the ADC. In particular, most of the cytotoxic payloads are hydrophobic in nature. Thus, linking them to the mAb with an additional hydrophobic moiety can create problems due to aggregation. ADC aggregates are insoluble and often limit achievable drug loading onto the antibody. It has been conjectured that ADC aggregates are sequestered in the liver, leading to hepatotoxicity (8). Lastly, protein aggregation of biologics, in general, has been linked to increased immunogenicity (9). Due to these safety concerns, aggregation needs to be monitored over time in ADC products to establish a safe shelf-life. In addition to aggregation problems, the hydrophobic characteristic of the majority of cytotoxic compounds in ADCs causes them to be good substrates for multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters. These transporters are responsible for effluxing cytotoxins out of the tumor cells, thus compromising efficacy. However, Kovtun et al. has shown that using a hydrophilic linker with maytansinoids produced a hydrophilic metabolite of DM1 which was not an MDR substrate (10).

Through this method, different drug antibody ratio (DAR) conjugates will be obtained when targeting typical DARs of 2\u20134 [13,14]. In addition, antibody-drug conjugate at each drug antibody ratio has several isomers. Thus, over a hundred different species are present in the antibody-drug conjugate. Although conventional methods that employ cysteine residues as conjugation sites are highly heterogeneous, Adcetris\u00ae was approved by FDA in 2011.\n \n Homogeneous antibody-drug conjugates can be produced through cysteine residues when all interchain cysteines are coupled to drugs. For example, Senter and coworkers [15,16] developed such a conjugate which consisted of cAC10, an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). This cAC10-vcMMAE conjugate contains eight drugs per antibody, which is the highest drug antibody ratio (DAR) that can be obtained through using interchain cysteines as conjugation sites. However, antibody-drug conjugates with four drugs per antibody generally have improved in vivo performance [17]. McDonagh et al. [18] developed a method to control the conjugate sites by mutating four or six of the interchain cysteines to serines, therefore leaving four or two cysteines accessible for conjugating (Scheme 1). After reduction of the disulfide bonds, the mutated monoclonal antibodies with the reduced number of interchain cysteines were conjugated with the drug vcMMAE. Through this method, homogenous antibody-drug conjugates with clear attachment sites could be produced.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1365b94e803e0bd89a683905b70cf069efe3c85a", "year": 2016, "authors": [{"authorId": "4166876", "name": "Houzong Yao"}, {"authorId": "2069981623", "name": "Feng Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2086739714", "name": "Aiping Lu"}, {"authorId": "144336463", "name": "Ge Zhang"}], "citation_count": 63}], "annotator": "benjamin", "id": "benjamin_bio_6", "subject": "bio", "output": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a promising therapeutic modality comprised of a tumor-specific monoclonal antibody (mAbs) that is coupled with cytotoxic agents through a chemical linker [0]. Generally, there are two types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers are designed to release the cytotoxic payload in the tumor tissues through hydrolysis at low pH, protease activity, and glutathione-mediated degradation. Non-cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are designed to release the payloads upon the degradation of the antibody. \n The linkers commonly connect the antibody and the cytotoxic payloads through lysine, inter-chain cysteines, or site-specific cysteines [1]. Antibodies have about 80 lysine sites that are available for conjugation [2]. Recently, a study by Pfizer reported that the direct conjugation of the carboxylic acid part of the payload with the surface lysines of the antibody exhibited enhanced potency in some ADC formulations in animal models with gastric cancer. Lysine conjugation also demonstrated good plasma stability and high tumor specificity; however, the yield after conjugation was very low, and there is a chance of heterogeneity in the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) [2].\n Cysteine conjugation potentially provides better ADC stability as they displayed less aggregation at a high DAR and comparable plasma/buffer stability as those with lysine conjugation [1]. Commonly, cysteine conjugation is achieved through a maleimide approach to form a thioester bond. Notably, studies reported enhanced cytotoxic performance of cysteine-conjugated ADCs compared to lysine-conjugated ones. Additionally, by incorporating a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to the cysteine conjugation, the ADC formulation could have improved aqueous solubility [2]."}, {"input": "What are potential candidates other than porcine model for xenotransplantation as a means to treat type-1 diabetes?", "ctxs": [{"title": "A brief review of the current status of pig islet xenotransplantation", "text": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by insulin-secreting \u03b2 cell destruction by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Genetic susceptibility plays a role in the development of T1D, which is associated in part with certain human leukocyte antigens (HLA) (1). Conventional treatment of T1D includes exogenous insulin therapy, which helps reduce hyperglycemia. However, in patients with unstable (\u2018brittle\u2019) diabetes, it is difficult to prevent life-threatening hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, as well as late complications, e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy, vascular disease (2). Islet allotransplantation is viewed as an efficient therapy for T1D.\n \n Studies have demonstrated that islet transplantation can significantly reduce, or eliminate, the need for daily insulin injections, marking a pivotal shift in T1D management (3). Furthermore, the enhanced quality of life, coupled with a notable reduction in diabetes-related complications, underscores the transformative potential of islet transplantation (4). By integrating detailed outcomes from relevant research, this introduction aims to illustrate the broader implications of islet transplantation, not only as a mechanism for blood sugar regulation but also to provide new solutions for the treatment of patients with T1D.\n \n However, the shortage of pancreases from deceased human donors poses a problem of increasing need for another source of islets, which may be met by gene-edited pigs (5\u20137).\n \n Indeed, xenotransplantation has immense potential for the treatment of numerous disorders and will prove to be the next great medical revolution (8). Pancreatic islet transplantation will benefit greatly from an unlimited number of gene-edited pigs. With the potential advantages of neonatal islets (see below), the transplantation of neonatal islet-like cell clusters (NICC), which will never be available in sufficient numbers from deceased human neonates, will become possible.\n \n As there are an estimated 1.5 million patients with T1D and perhaps 30 million with type 2 diabetes in the USA alone, the number of islet transplants carried out worldwide will increase exponentially. The islet grafts will control the patient\u2019s blood glucose for long periods of time (if not permanently) without the need for daily insulin injections.

Fortunately, recent advances where consistent long-term survival (\u22656 months) of adult porcine islet grafts was achieved in five independent, diabetic nonhuman primates (NHPs) enabled us to investigate on the late graft loss. Regardless of the conventional immune monitoring methods applied in the post-transplant period, the initiation of late graft loss could rarely be detected before the overt graft loss observed via uncontrolled blood glucose level. Thus, we retrospectively analyzed the gene expression profiles in 2 rhesus monkey recipients using peripheral blood RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data to find out the potential cause(s) of late graft loss. Bioinformatic analyses showed that highly relevant immunological pathways were activated in the animal which experienced late graft failure.

Islet transplantation is an efficient therapy for T1DM by supplying a population of islets containing insulin-secreting \u03b2-cells to restore the normal fasting blood glucose level without the need for routine insulin injections. The main limitation, however, of this approach is the shortage of human donors. Naturally, researchers have investigated the potential of xenotransplantation as an alternative to allotransplantation. \n Currently, gene-edited pigs are the primary candidates for xenotransplantation since porcine insulin is compatible with humans and theoretically, there are unlimited supplies [0]. Unfortunately, there are no animal candidates other than porcine models that could be used for T1DM therapy due to their lack of compatibility and efficacy. Hence, all the research efforts are geared towards improving the efficacy of isolating islets from porcine pancreata and minimizing the risk of infections. For instance, adult or neonatal pigs are ideal xenotransplantation candidates as they have a sufficient number of fully differentiated islets that are ready for transplantation [1,3]. Furthermore, gene-editing technologies were applied to produce pigs to form clinically suitable transplantation islet modalities, which had better results with minimized immunosuppressive therapy. Animal studies showed that porcine islets with a number of knocked-out genes improved the glucose profile and survival rate of diabetic mice and non-human primates [2-3].\n Potentially, an artificial pancreas system can replace porcine islets in the future as these new technologies could measure and control blood glucose levels automatically [3].

Thus, there arises an ethical tension between the good of the recipient and the good of society. Correlatively, it is extremely unlikely that the identity of those receiving xenotransplants can be kept confidential, so it is quite possible that such people will be seen as significantly different, or even as \u201cfreaks\u201d, particularly if the recipient is a child and will likely be subject to taunting with locutions like \u201cpig heart\u201d regularly thrown at them, which in turn can cause significant psychological damage. Another ethical issue associated with xenotransplantation is the question of how such organs would be distributed. What is a fair way to assure equitable distribution of both risks and benefits [5]?\n \n In sum, there are a variety of dangers associated with xenotransplantation, both for recipients and for the public at large. As yet, however, none of these projected dangers have come to pass, in part because there have been no successful xenotransplants. Governments have been extremely cautious about allowing unrestricted research into xenotransplantation to proceed, presumably because of societal hesitation regarding all aspects of biotechnology.\n \n Go to:\n 3. Animal Welfare Issues Associated with Xenotransplantation\n Some people are instinctively horrified by the idea of raising pigs to put their organs into human bodies. A reality check should diminish that reaction. The number of animals raised for xenotransplantation will probably number in the thousands. In contrast, the number of pigs killed in a year in the world for food is over a billion [6]! If we can cavalierly kill that many pigs in pursuit of bacon, ham, and sausages, we should surely not be horrified at killing them in order to save human lives.\n \n The ethical issue of concern to the majority of society is not the killing of animals, as the above number attests. There is little reason to believe that animals fear death or anticipate that it is coming. Lacking human linguistic capacity, animals cannot conceive of death, described by Heidegger as \u201cawareness of the possibility of the impossibility of [their] being\u201d. While animals certainly communicate, they do not possess the ability to transcend the moment and imagine the future.

The aim of this text is therefore to encourage the readers to consider the vast potential of this emerging technique to do good, but also the risk of doing harm, and to participate in a discussion within the ISHLT, in other societies engaged in XTx, and elsewhere. To initiate this discussion, the ISHLT Board of Directors charged the ISHLT Ethics Committee to create a document outlining questions that need to be discussed regarding XTx. The list of questions presented here is not exhaustive but hopefully represents some of the questions that appear to be most pressing as the field advances.

Since there are potential pathogenic risks for those who received xenotransplantation, they need to be carefully monitored as a means of establishing public health. That means there could be a severe limitation on one's privacy and those around them, including family, friends, and work associates [1-2]. \n Another factor is the society's acceptance of these recipients.

FUS exposures were conducted with different Definity microbubble concentrations at various acoustic pressures. To quantify the effects of infusion on BBB opening, we calculated the MRI contrast enhancement rate. When infusions were performed at rates of 7.2 \u00b5l microbubbles/kg/min or below, we were able to obtain consistent BBB opening without injury at all pressures. However, when infusion rates exceeded 20 \u00b5l/kg/min, signs of injury occurred at pressures from 0.39 to 0.56 MPa. When compared to bolus injections, a bubble infusion offers a more controlled and consistent approach to multi-target BBB disruption. Definity (Perflutren Lipid Microsphere) ultrasound contrast agent was purchased from Lantheus Medical Imaging (N. Billerica, MA, USA). The mean bubble diameter is given by the manufacturer as ranging from 1.1 to 3.3 \u00b5m, therefore the centre of this range, 2.2 \u00b5m, was used for bubble gas volume calculations. Based on supplier specifications, a single vial contains up to 1.2 \u00d7 1010 perflutren lipid microspheres once activated. As such we approximated 1 \u00d7 1010 microbubbles/1500 \u00b5l bubble agent/vial for all calculations.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34e0a32a0473b6855f1cce50c433f6ef3b1a7cbc", "year": 2020, "authors": [{"authorId": "5163503", "name": "N.

The tight gap of the semi-permeable barrier only allows lipid-soluble drugs with an average molecular weight lower than 600 Da through passive diffusion. \n Nanoparticles are commonly used to deliver therapeutics to the brain by crossing the BBB thanks to their small size, low toxicity, biocompatibility, and controllable drug release kinetics [1]. For brain delivery applications, nanoparticles between 10-100 nm are the most effective, but the optimal size depends on the type of biomaterial that forms the nanoparticles.\n Interestingly, some studies reported that some 1-10 \u00b5m bacteria can pass through the BBB, which gave the researchers an idea to develop bacteria-mediated drug delivery systems [0]. Other studies also demonstrated the BBB crossing of micron-scale plastic particles using polystyrene (PS) microspheres of size 0.293, 1.14, and 9.55 \u00b5m, with the smallest particle reaching the brain within only 2 hours upon exposure [2]. \n Researchers have developed various methods for improved drug delivery to the brain, and one good example is the focused ultrasound technique with microbubbles [3].

These features lead to tumor tissues showing considerable extravasation of plasma components and nanomedicines. These data comprise the basic theory underlying the development of macromolecular agents or nanomedicines. The EPR effect is not necessarily valid for all solid tumors, because tumor blood flow and vascular permeability vary greatly. Tumor blood flow is frequently obstructed as tumor size increases, as often seen clinically; early stage, small tumors show a more uniform EPR effect, whereas advanced large tumor show heterogeneity in EPR effect. Accordingly, it would be very important to apply enhancers of EPR effect in clinical setting to make EPR effect more uniform.

The need for better clinical outcomes in patients with cancer has led researchers to reconsider therapeutic strategies. To overcome these issues, the structural characteristics of solid tumors, drug nanocarrier transport in tumor vessels and the interstitium, selective drug delivery systems, and analytical tools should be carefully considered to develop cancer therapeutics [2,3]. Although it has long been thought that drug nanocarriers will facilitate cancer therapeutics by directing drugs to solid tumors, nanomedicine development has not yet achieved promising clinical outcomes. Numerous reports indicate that virus-/inorganic nanoparticles-/organic nanoparticles-based nanocarriers could improve the efficacy and safety of anticancer drugs through potential targeting, mitigated drug release in non-target tissues, and pH-sensitive drug release in the tumor microenvironment (TME) [4,5,6,7]. Tumor vascular permeability and the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) mechanism in macromolecular drug delivery to solid tumors have been reported as successful strategies for cancer therapeutics [8,9,10]. However, the low EPR effect in human solid tumors [8], poor tumor extravasation [11] and infiltration [11], and a diversity in the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) [12] has resulted in the full realization of EPR-mediated cancer therapeutics [13].\n Today, simulation models have reported the dynamics of tumor vessel cooption and have promoted the treatment of solid tumors [14,15]. However, different results were obtained from different strategies aimed at investigating EPR-mediated drug delivery to cancer cells. Different results can be related to the animal species used, the extent of intratumoral ECM content, an unorganized tumor vasculature, the diverse properties of drug nanocarriers, variable fluid velocities, the types of malignant cells in the TIME despite having the exact origin, and the heterogeneous tissues of a solid tumor [16,17,18,19,20,21]. Despite the certainty of the EPR-mediated tumor targeting and cancer nanomedicine treatment efficacy [22], the negative side of the EPR effect in cancer nano-therapy is derived from the heterogeneous microvascular networks of solid tumors, which results in heterogeneous distributions of nanomedicines. Therefore, a full exploration of the EPR effect in solid tumors and issues associated with dynamics, such as pathophysiological and pathoanatomic characteristics, drug nanocarrier formulations, physicochemical factors, and EPR analytical methodology, can provide useful information in the development of EPR-based therapeutics.\n In this regard, Nichols and Bae [9] discussed that the EPR approach in the therapeutic activities of animal tumors is more prominent than in human tumors due to significant differences in tumor structure and function [9]. Furthermore, Maeda, et al. [23] reported that the use of EPR in the imaging process based on the presence of nano-probes and nanocarriers in the tumor for a short time (a few minutes) is more appropriate than for therapeutic activities. However, they showed that the EPR effect varies based on the physicochemical properties of the nanocarriers [23]. Moreover, Danhier [17] discussed some factors that result in EPR pitfalls in clinical trials, the future of EPR, and the required changes in drug nanocarriers. Recently, Wu [22] reported that despite the meager success of the EPR effect in clinical trials, it can be enhanced by regulating the physicochemical properties of nanocarriers, treatment duration, and the type of anti-cancer agents. At the same time, Izci, et al. [24] explained the advantages and challenges of EPR, the EPR enhancement mechanisms, and the study of independent EPR-based drug delivery strategies.\n Although these review articles have comprehensively discussed the EPR-based therapeutics of solid tumors, people have not surveyed EPR-based tumor targeting with a focus on fluid flow and convection/diffusion mechanisms. Therefore, this review discusses changes in structure as the tumor grows and how fluid flow, convection/diffusion, and the physicochemical properties of nanocarriers affect the EPR-based transport of nanocarriers in solid tumors. Additionally, we discuss the need for improved novelty methodologies in analyzing the EPR effect.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/785435925e4be81f08b6f9a32ce58591962fca84", "year": 2022, "authors": [{"authorId": "11613665", "name": "M.

The polymer-drug conjugates were i.v. administered, and 10-to-100-fold higher concentrations were achieved relative to free drug administration [2,3,4]. Passively targeted cancer drugs at first reached the clinic about 30 years ago with the approval of an EPR-based drug, a PEGylated liposomal drug, DOXIL. Nanocarriers preferentially accumulate in the tumor through passive targeting due to a leaky vasculature and defective lymphatic drainage in solid tumors. The permeability of a chaotic vasculature and tumor microenvironment (TME) and retention can lead to the accumulation of macromolecules in TME by 70-fold. The leaky and defective vasculature created due to the rapid vascularization vital to the support of malignant tumors, coupled with imperfect lymphatic drainage, allows the EPR effect. The tumor vasculature is leaky and also irregular in diameter, shape, and density with discontinuous vessels. This results in several conditions, including heterogenous perfusion in the tumor, elevated interstitial fluid pressure from the extravasation of fluid, hypoxia, and an acidic environment [5]. EPR-based drug delivery depends on various factors, including circulation time, targeting, and the ability to overcome barriers, which are dependent on size, shape, and surface properties of the drug particles. Passive-targeting is mainly based on a diffusion mechanism. As a result, size is a crucial factor in the EPR-dependent delivery process. Studies have indicated that a nanoparticle size range of approximately 40 to 400 nm is suitable to ensure long circulation time, and enhanced accumulation in tumors with reduced renal clearance [6]. Shape and morphology also play important roles in passive targeting. Generally, rigid, spherical particles of size ranging from 50 to 200 nm have the highest tendency to long circulation, to avoid uptake by liver and spleen, but large enough to avoid kidney clearance [7,8]. Surface properties play a critical role in determining the internalization process of the drug particles into the target cell. To avoid opsonization and subsequent clearance by the RES, surface modification of polymers using PEG can be effective to a certain extent. Thus, the EPR-based drug delivery can be modulated by modifying the size, shape and sometimes by surface alteration of the nanoparticles.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e274cc5538c8ce64b42706c752e9cd357ce4ede", "year": 2021, "authors": [{"authorId": "120893195", "name": "Md Abdus Subhan"}, {"authorId": "1607010042", "name": "Satya Siva Kishan Yalamarty"}, {"authorId": "9685831", "name": "Nina Filipczak"}, {"authorId": "2265991", "name": "F.

Tumor-targeted therapeutics can take advantage of the EPR effect to deliver anti-tumor drugs and imaging agents to the tumor tissues. It is reported that the EPR effect could lead to the accumulation of macromolecules in the tumor microenvironment by 70-fold compared to the neighboring normal tissues [3]. Yet many forms of nanocarriers that rely on the EPR effect have failed to achieve therapeutic potency and efficacy in the clinic [1]. Hence, it is important to understand how the tumor progression correlates with the efficacy of the EPR effect-mediated drug delivery. \n Some of the crucial factors determining the efficacy of the EPR effect are the blood flow and vascular permeability as they could vary greatly between tumors and their progressions [0]. Early-stage tumors have more uniform EPR effect, yet as the tumors progress to later stage, larger tumors obstruct blood flow, thus leading to a more heterogenous EPR effect. On the other hand, if the tumors are in their benign stage, there is no proper vasculature structure to deliver the therapeutic agents to the tumor environment, which means proper vasculature structure is required to fully utilize the EPR effect [2].\n Some studies also reported that the EPR effect is more prominent in animal tumors compared to human tumors as their tumor structure and function are significantly different from one another [2-3]. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the nanocarrier heavily influence the outcome of the EPR effect, it is essential to design the nanocarriers for enhanced specificity and treatment duration.

We fine-tuned this linear regressor on 410,000 of our Llama 3 synthetic annotations for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 3e-4 (while keeping the embedding and encoder layers frozen).

As shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, we observed that FineWeb-Edu surpasses FineWeb and all other open web datasets, with quite remarkable improvements on educational benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC and OpenBookQA. Specifically, MMLU score increases from 33% to 37%, a relative improvement of approximately 12%, and\nARC score goes from 46% to 57%, an improvement of about 24%. On MMLU, FineWeb-Edu can match the final performance of Matrix with almost 10x fewer tokens, demonstrating the effectiveness of classifiers\ntrained on LLM annotations for large-scale data filtering.

However, LLM pre-training often requires a massive amount of text, and while there is an enormous amount of raw web data, such as CommonCrawl, this data frequently requires extensive processing and content filtering [4]. To manage computational costs, efficient non-neural models like fastText classifiers are often used to detect high-quality pre-training text data from large volumes of raw text. Prior work has utilized fastText classifiers for tasks like language identification [0] or to find high-quality text in specific domains such as math [1]. Other studies, such as GPT-3, have used logistic regression classifiers to select higher-quality text data as predicted by the model [2].\n\nHowever, such simple classifier models may not be precise enough. For instance, in general NLP tasks, fine-tuning pre-trained LMs like BERT often shows much better performance than fastText-based classifiers [3]. Recently, several state-of-the-art LMs have leveraged trained neural models to build more powerful content classifiers.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of FineWebEdu, the authors conducted an ablation, training a 1.82B model on 350 billion tokens, and observed that FineWebEdu surpasses all other open web datasets, with significant improvements on educational benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC, and OpenBookQA [6].\n\nLlama 3 [7]: Llama 3 uses a RoBERTa-based classifier (Liu et al., 2019a) trained on a synthetic training set created by Llama 2. Specifically, they instruct Llama 2\u2019s chat model to determine if cleaned web documents meet certain quality requirements.\n\nWhile such neural quality classifiers are often much more computationally expensive [2], empirical findings suggest that these classifiers may enable us to identify higher-quality pre-training data, which is essential for building more powerful models [5][7]."}, {"input": "Hi everyone, I want to use LLM to evaluate the quality of my synthetically generated data using GPT-4.

Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation motivates applying a \"compute-optimal\" scaling strategy, which acts to most effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline.

In particular, previous work points out that such a small amount of training data may not teach LMs new capabilities, such as improved factuality [4], but still be rated positively by human evaluators as they learn to mimic the style of powerful LMs [5]. WebInstruct [6] also shows that by scaling the instruction-tuning data to 10 million instances, efficiently mined from the web, their proposed Mammoth 2 model can outperform LLaMA-3-Instruct by 6 points on reasoning tasks. These findings may indicate that while small training datasets can be sufficient to mimic certain styles or acquire instruction-following abilities to some extent, post-pretraining approaches such as instruction-tuning can still teach new knowledge or skills like reasoning and are thus essential to further improving LLMs.\n\n"}, {"input": "Have anyone tried training with 4-bit quantization?

For instance, Self-Instruct [0] is one of the earlier works that uses LLMs to generate synthetic data\u2014it iteratively starts with a limited seed set of manually written tasks used to guide the overall generation. The model is prompted to generate instructions for new tasks, and then prompted again to generate responses to those instructions [1]. This research shows that GPT-3 can generate diverse instruction-tuning data and demonstrates that by fine-tuning GPT-3 on GPT-3-generated synthetic data, the fine-tuned models can further improve performance on diverse benchmarks. GPT-3 Self-Instruct outperforms the original GPT-3 model by a large margin (+33.1%) [1]. This inspired many follow-up works, such as Alpaca and Vicuna, which use powerful LLMs to generate high-quality instruction-tuning data [2].\n\n## Generating Hard Reasoning Problems\nSeveral papers demonstrate the effectiveness of generating questions and answers for hard mathematical reasoning tasks [3].\n\n- WizardMath [4] introduces Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF), which first generates diverse math instruction data through math-specific Evol-Instruct, then trains an instruction reward model (IRM) and a process-supervised reward model. By producing grade-school and challenging math problems and training the Llama-2 models with these reward models, WizardMath achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance [5].\n- MetaMath [6] bootstraps the questions in MATH and GSM8K by rewriting them in different ways, showing that training Llama-2 on the resulting MetaMath dataset leads to state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks (i.e., GSM8K and MATH).\n\nSeveral works also show the effectiveness of LLM-based synthetic data generation beyond mathematical reasoning. For instance:\n\nSelf-Taught Reasoner (STaR) [7] is a simple approach to generating rationales for answering questions. 1) Prompt the LLM with a few rationale examples to generate answers with rationales. 2) If the answers are wrong, generate a rationale given the correct answer. 3) Collect the rationales that result in correct answers. 4) Fine-tune the model on all the rationales that yielded correct answers [7]. STaR has been shown to be effective at improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on commonsense QA, achieving 35% higher performance than the few-shot baseline and improving on a fine-tuned baseline that only predicts answers by 12.5% [8].

A survey shows that more than 20% of the surveyed datasets involve either human or automatic translations for data creation [0]. For instance, several widely used datasets such as XNLI [2] and XQuAD [1] are created by translating existing English datasets. Below, I summarize the advantages and disadvantages of such dataset creation.\n\n## Advantages\n\nFirst, translation-based data creation enables the creation of parallel data across many languages and removes reliance on the limited number of language-proficient annotators [0]. Such parallel questions can enable fair performance comparisons across different languages [3][2]. Furthermore, by translating existing datasets into the target languages, we do not need to retrain annotators for each language, which could be quite expensive [3]. It also enables easy scaling up to many languages [3]. \n\n## Disadvantages\n\nOn the other hand, there are also several significant disadvantages of reusing existing English datasets. For instance, translated text often looks different from purely native text, such as preserving source-language word order or the use of more constrained language by translators, which is often called \"Translationese\" [4]. Secondly, such datasets may face risks of ignoring target cultural complexity or forcing source-culture concepts on the target culture [5], and they may not reflect native speakers' true interests [6]. While asking human annotators to carefully choose or translate the original text into target languages can reduce such potential biases, it could result in increased cost [7]. \n\nIn summary, while translating existing datasets into target languages enables cost-effective and scalable multilingual dataset creation, there are several risks, such as neglecting native speakers' actual writing styles or interests, which should be carefully considered.

This model has shown superior performance over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) bi-directional embedding models of that time, including OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large, Cohere-embed-english-v3.0, and voyage-lite-01-instruct on the MTEB benchmark [7].\n\nAnother study LLM2Vec [1] demonstrates the adaptation of a decoder model solely using public data for embedding tasks, which also achieved remarkable results on the MTEB benchmark [7], surpassing other encoder models by a significant margin. This highlights the potential of decoder models when optimized appropriately.\n\nFurthermore, the GRIT model [2] unifies auto-regressive and bi-directional model designs. It incorporates two distinct language modeling heads atop the Transformer layers: one auto-regressive head, designed for generative tasks with a causal attention mask, and another bi-directional head, tailored for embedding tasks. This dual-head approach allows GRIT to leverage the strengths of both modeling techniques.\n\nLastly, the NV-Embed model [3] adapts the decoder model architecture to enhance finetuning effectiveness using public datasets.

However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG) that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens.

To address this gap, we propose Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference (SecMI), a query-based MIA that infers memberships by assessing the matching of forward process posterior estimation at each timestep. SecMI follows the common overfitting assumption in MIA where member samples normally have smaller estimation errors, compared with hold-out samples.

If the cumbersome model generalizes well because, for example, it is the average of a large ensemble of different models, a small model trained to generalize in the same way will typically do much better on test data than a small model that is trained in the normal way on the same training set as was used to train the ensemble. An obvious way to transfer the generalization ability of the cumbersome model to a small model is to use the class probabilities produced by the cumbersome model as \u201csoft targets\u201d for training the small model.

The teacher has access to the complete set, thereby learning to classify them appropriately (orange decision boundary). On the other hand, suppose that the training of the independent and distilled student is done on a subset of the points. The independent student can learn to classify them in different ways, where each decision boundary can be thought of as looking for different features, hence giving rise to different properties. But the distilled student is trying to mimic the teacher\u2019s class probabilities, which reflect the distance from the (orange) decision boundary of the teacher, visualized as circles around the points. Then the decision boundary of the distilled student should remain tangential to these circles so that it preserves the teacher\u2019s distances.

In contrast, the distillation literature focuses largely on improving student generalization, without particularly distinguishing between fidelity and generalization. For example, concurrent work by Beyer et al. [4] does not carefully distinguish generalization and fidelity metrics, but they assert that high student fidelity is conceptually desirable and apparently difficult to achieve when measured as the gap between teacher and student accuracy. As a result their work focuses most heavily on practical modifications to the distillation procedure for the best student top-1 accuracy. In this paper we investigate many of the same prescriptions, including careful treatment of data augmentation (such as showing the teacher and student the exact same input images), the addition of MixUp, and extended training duration. We also find that such interventions do improve student accuracy, but there still remains a large discrepancy between the predictive distributions of the teacher and the student.

It can gain the adversarial vulnerability that the teacher has. If the teacher is invariant to color, the student also improves its invariance to color. To understand why these properties get transferred without an explicit objective to do so, we study the distillation process through a geometric lens, where we think about the features from a teacher as relative positions of an instance (i.e., distances) from its decision boundary. Mimicking those features, we posit, can therefore help the student inherit the decision boundary and (consequently) the implicit properties of the teacher.

Corroborating this, [4] finds that distilled students\u2019 decision boundaries have higher similarity score to their teachers\u2019 than to identically initalized moels trained without distillation. This is counter to previous hypotheses that distiillation improves generalization through other means, that while student models show high generalizability, they show low fidelity (i.e., a large contrast between the predictive distributions of the teacher and student) [5].

For instance, OpenAI (2023) and Kadavath et al. (2022) have reported LM calibration on MMLU, which consists of 57 individual domains like abstract algebra, high school chemistry etc. However, in practice, users querying an LM at a given point rarely sample from a broad aggregate distribution. They are more likely to sample from meaningful slices, like queries from abstract algebra alone. Yu et al. (2022); Hebert-Johnson et al. (2018) have shown that individual domains often suffer from miscalibration problem even if the aggregate distribution appears well-calibrated. To demonstrate the same phenomenon for language models, we measure calibration of LLaMA65B on combined MMLU (p), and also on each domain separately. As expected, the model is wellcalibrated on p. However, the LM is significantly miscalibrated for most domains. This is shown in (Figure 2) where the aggregate ECE is lower than that of most domains. It appears that the miscalibration problem is hidden for the broader distribution because overconfidence in some domains cancels out underconfidence in others.

Calibration is typically measured by the Expected Calibration Error (ECE), which measures the L1 distance between confidence and accuracy by assigning predictions to equal-sized bins based on confidence estimates [1]. Model calibration can vary significantly based on different training processes, e.g. pretraining or alignment. In a comprehensive analysis across pretraining and alignment training stages, [2] finds that language model calibration improves during pretraining with model scale or training duration; however, instruction tuning or synthetic data during the alignment stage can be harmful. Several recent methods have proposed ways to improve calibration in language models. [3] studies calibration in BERT and RoBERTa, two encoder-only LMs, and finds that temperature scaling can effectively lower in-domain ECE, while label smoothing helps lower out-of-domain ECE. [5, 6] notes that LMs fine-tuned with RLHF may experience degraded calibration ability from their conditional probabilities, and finds instead that verbalized confidence scores (emitted as output tokens) is a better calibration signal. Finally, [6] describes a problem in which LMs may appear well-calibrated across aggregate domains, they can be significantly miscalibrated for sub-domains within that distribution. The study poses MMLU, a common language modeling benchmark, as an example -- the LlaMa-65B model may exhibit low ECE scores as a whole, even though it has high ECE scores over a majority of the domains [7]. To correct for this issue, the study proposes to train a few-shot recalibration model that relises on a few unlabeled examples to predict recalibrated model confidence scores [8]."}, {"input": "Social bias in large language models is an endemic problem, as models often inherit and amplify stereotypical judgments due to naturally occurring, yet undesirable statistical associations from training corpora.

It has recently also become common to use models consisting of a single Transformer layer stack, with varying forms of self-attention used to produce architectures appropriate for language modeling (Radford et al., 2018; Al-Rfou et al., 2019) or classification and span prediction tasks (Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). We empirically explore these architectural variants in Section 3.2. Overall, our encoder-decoder Transformer implementation closely follows its originallyproposed form (Vaswani et al., 2017). First, an input sequence of tokens is mapped to a sequence of embeddings, which is then passed into the encoder. The encoder consists of a stack of \u201cblocks\u201d, each of which comprises two subcomponents: a self-attention layer followed by a small feed-forward network. Layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) is applied to the input of each subcomponent. We use a simplified version of layer normalization where the activations are only rescaled and no additive bias is applied. After layer normalization, a residual skip connection (He et al., 2016) adds each subcomponent\u2019s input to its output. Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) is applied within the feed-forward network, on the skip connection, on the attention weights, and at the input and output of the entire stack. The decoder is similar in structure to the encoder except that it includes a standard attention mechanism after each self-attention layer that attends to the output of the encoder. The self-attention mechanism in the decoder also uses a form of autoregressive or causal selfattention, which only allows the model to attend to past outputs. The output of the final decoder block is fed into a dense layer with a softmax output, whose weights are shared with the input embedding matrix. All attention mechanisms in the Transformer are split up into independent \u201cheads\u201d whose outputs are concatenated before being further processed.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c4b76232bb72897685d19b3d264c6ee3005bc2b", "year": 2019, "authors": [{"authorId": "2402716", "name": "Colin Raffel"}, {"authorId": "1846258", "name": "Noam M.

In this paper, we introduce a novel, straightforward yet effective pruning method, termed Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations), designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in LLMs, our approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations, on a per-output basis.

Pruning uses heuristics (Sanh et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021a) to identify parts of a model to prune. Lottery ticket hypothesis (Frankle and Carbin, 2019) introduces the concept of sparse subnetworks within a model, called winning tickets, which have the full model\u2019s task capability, but pruning of weights is unstructured. A different line of work introduces semi-structured pruning (Kao et al., 2022), which improves throughput speed over unstructured pruning via accelerator-specific kernels. Structured pruning approaches (Fan et al., 2019; Kao et al., 2022) aim to prune larger blocks within a model while considering architecture nuances for improving inference speed. Structured pruning can be coarse- or fine-grained. Coarsegrained pruning removes entire model layers (Fan et al., 2019). In the case of LMs, fine-grained pruning methods prunes atomic components like attention-heads (Voita et al., 2019; Michel et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021b) or hidden layers (Hou et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020b; McCarley et al., 2019).

Task-agnostic pruning approaches (Chen et al., 2020b; Fan et al., 2019) prune a model on pretraining data and then add task specialization as a second step.

In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting the ShearedLLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, OpenLLaMA and the concurrent TinyLlama models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch.

Like existing algorithms, DPO relies on a theoretical preference model (such as the Bradley-Terry model; [5 ]) that measures how well a given reward function aligns with empirical preference data. However, while existing methods use the preference model to define a preference loss to train a reward model and then train a policy that optimizes the learned reward model, DPO uses a change of variables to define the preference loss as a function of the policy directly.

RLHF algorithms are typically reward-based (e.g., PPO) or reward-free (e.g., DPO, SimPO) [1, 2]. Under a reward-based paradigm, a reward model is first constructed using human preference data (assumed to correspond to the Bradley-Terry model) [2]. Then, an actor-critic algorithm such as PPO is employed  to finetune the policy (reward model), using signals from the learned reward model [2]. Reward-free approaches bypass the need for an external reward model and directly optimize the policy over the preference data [3]. DPO, for example, reparameterizes the reward function using a closed-form expression with the optimal policy such that its objective expresses the probability of preference data with the policy model [5, 6]. While DPO is simpler and more stable than PPO, it is also more vulnerable to distribution shift; in a head-to-head comparison, [6] finds that PPO consistently outperforms DPO across all experiments. SimPO is a recent improvement over DPO, and exploits the observation that DPO\u2019s reqrd formulation is not directly aligned with the metric used to guide generation (the average log likelihood of a response generated by the policy model)[7].

In dynamic light scattering, digital camera detection schemes allow for real-time suppression of multiple scattering, facilitating clearer dynamic measurements [1]. Structured laser illumination planar imaging employs patterned light to differentiate between single and multiple scattering events, significantly improving image resolution in scattering and fluorescing media [4].

At this pressure, the peaks in the power spectrum due to the three fundamental modes are distinguishable, and heating effects due to the laser are negligible. We can therefore use the measured power spectra at 637\u2009Pa to calibrate the position detectors for the fundamental modes at room temperature. After we turn on feedback cooling, the temperature of the Y mode changes from 297 to 24\u2009K at 637\u2009Pa. Then we reduce the air pressure while keeping the feedback gain almost constant; thus, the heating rate due to collisions from air molecules decreases, while the cooling rate remains constant. As a result, the temperature of the motion drops. At 5.2\u2009mPa, the mode temperatures are 150\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u2009mK, 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009mK and 68\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009mK for the X, Y and Z modes.

Here, \u210f is the reduced Planck constant. Figure 3d shows the temperature of the three fundamental modes as a function of pressure.

By measuring the real-time position of the levitated nanoparticle, its instantaneous velocity can be determined, allowing for the application of a feedback cooling scattering force in the opposite direction of the velocity. Using this approach, the center-of-mass (CoM) motion of a levitated nanoparticle can be cooled from room temperature to 1.5 mK [1], or even to the ground state in cryogenic environments [2].\n\nAn alternative method involves levitating the nanosphere in an optical cavity and cooling via coherent scattering [3]. The trapping laser is red-detuned from the optical resonance at the CoM motional frequency. The anti-Stokes scattering process, which removes energy from the nanoparticle, becomes resonant with and enhanced by the optical cavity. This technique can cool the CoM motion to temperatures as low as 1 K [4] and also to the ground-state [5].\n\nA more recent proposal, known as cold damping, is similar to conventional feedback cooling.

We demonstrate quantum superposition of these massive particles by measuring interference fringes in a new 2-m-long Talbot\u2013Lau interferometer that permits access to a wide range of particle masses with a large variety of internal states. The molecules in our study have de Broglie wavelengths down to 53\u2009fm, five orders of magnitude smaller than the diameter of the molecules themselves. Our results show excellent agreement with quantum theory and cannot be explained classically. The interference fringes reach more than 90% of the expected visibility and the resulting macroscopicity value of 14.1 represents an order of magnitude increase over previous experiments.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1496dfc5fbb52be82421a841f33f37046985a9ec", "year": 2019, "authors": [{"authorId": "49736861", "name": "Yaakov Y.

This approach has been used to verify the wave nature of electrons, thereby confirming de Broglie's theory and revealing the existence of quantum superposition. In 1999 [0], scientists directed a source of C60 molecules emerging from an oven onto a SiNx grating consisting of nominally 50-nm-wide slits with a 100-nm period. From the measured diffraction pattern, the zero-order and first-order peaks were clearly observed, aligning with the predictions of Kirchhoff diffraction theory. This confirmed that C60 exhibits quantum wave-like behavior, or in other words, coherent superposition. In 2019, the same research group conducted a similar interference experiment using functionalized oligoporphyrins, revealing their quantum wave-like behavior [1]. The mass of these molecules exceeded 25 kDa.\n\nAnother commonly used macroscopic system for studying quantum properties is the mechanical resonator. In earlier experiments, researchers were able to prepare the vibrational mode of a suspended film bulk acoustic resonator in its quantum ground state and perform operations at the single-phonon level [2]. In the experiment, researchers used two aluminum membranes as the top plates of two capacitors, which were connected in parallel with an inductor to form a resonant cavity. By applying a microwave signal, they prepared an entangled state of the vibrations of the two aluminum membranes and confirmed it through quantum state tomography [3]. This experiment is then regarded as a direct demonstration of the entanglement and manipulation of macroscopic objects.\n\nAdditionally, other phenomena such as coherent states of superfluids [4], the Josephson effect in superconductors [5], and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) [6] are also regarded as macroscopic quantum phenomena.\n"}, {"input": "What progress has been made in trapping and controlling multiple nanoparticles?", "ctxs": [{"title": "The primeval optical evolving matter by optical binding inside and outside the photon beam", "text": "When a sixth Au NP is trapped, the motion of each NP becomes much more complex and dynamic, and the number of possible configurations is dramatically increased as well.

The sensitivity and versatility of conventional acoustic-based sensing devices can be greatly enhanced by confining phonons in a small volume with long lifetime and routing propagating phonons in more complex circuits in the PnIC architecture. Improved performance of the circuit in a cryogenic environment paves the way for future interfacing with superconducting quantum devices. Additionally, our GNOS platform is compatible with PICs, allowing the coupling of phonons and photons through optoacoustic interaction on a single chip. Therefore, quantum links between superconducting qubit and propagating optical field can be built based on the PnIC. Moreover, the ring geometry gives rise to the coupling between OAM and spin of phonons. This new phenomenon opens doors for applications such as acoustic gyroscopic and non-reciprocal devices.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d6fd3b48f3ba138412dc89ef601e282c5142d7f", "year": 2019, "authors": [{"authorId": "48296548", "name": "Wei Fu"}, {"authorId": "145211000", "name": "Zhen Shen"}, {"authorId": "3260268", "name": "Yuntao Xu"}, {"authorId": "3139395", "name": "Chang-ling Zou"}, {"authorId": "26938179", "name": "Risheng Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2110980715", "name": "Xu Han"}, {"authorId": "39710335", "name": "H.

However, this is difficult to achieve with current experimental techniques. As a result, researchers have proposed using heralded entangled photon pair generation and detection [0]. The key principle behind this approach is that only events where a emission photon is successfully detected after conversion are considered, allowing for effective quantum state transfer without requiring high conversion efficiency.\n\nBased on the aforementioned heralded method, researchers first investigated the microwave state resulting from phonon state conversion when a microwave-to-optics transducer is used to introduce phonons into the system [1]. It was observed that the random-selected phase space probabilistic distribution of the microwave photons differed from the post-selected distribution, aligning with theoretical predictions [2]. This demonstrated the quantum nature of the microwave-to-optics transducer.\n\nFollowing this, using a similar approach, another group of researchers verified the entanglement between microwave photons and optical photons generated by the transducer [3]. They reported a lower bound on the Bell state fidelity of 0.794, which exceeds the classical limit of 0.5 [4]. Building on this, the authors also studied the normalized microwave-optical intensity cross-correlation function, finding a significant degree of correlation between the microwave and optical photons generated by the transducer, surpassing the classical bound for thermal states [5].

Thus it is expected that the results obtained under the assumption of weak gravity also apply for the case of a neutron star binary. Experimental evidence for the strong equivalence principle is obtained only for systems with weak gravity, but at present no experiment is available in a case with strong internal gravity.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a51789281b02f51afca0ee6d410a69c4393e75a6", "year": 2007, "authors": [{"authorId": "29999141", "name": "T.

This approach allows scientists to probe various facets of fundamental physics, revealing insights that a single messenger could not.\n\nFor example, the diffuse backgrounds of cosmic rays, high-energy neutrinos, and gamma rays are expected to be interconnected, and identifying their sources requires a multi-messenger approach. Similarly, binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, which produce gravitational waves, photons, and neutrinos, benefit from MMA techniques to understand the underlying astrophysical processes. If one type of signal is detected but another is not, it can constrain models of the source mechanisms.\n\nEach messenger offers unique insights into the universe while having its own limitations:\n\nElectromagnetic observations reveal physical properties like temperature, chemical composition, velocity, and redshift but cannot penetrate the dense cores of systems such as BNS or binary black hole (BBH) mergers. [0]\n\nGravitational waves, on the other hand, provide a new way to explore electromagnetically dark phenomena and test general relativity under extreme conditions, although their detection is limited to massive systems like BBH mergers due to their weak nature. [1]\n\nCosmic rays, traveling at nearly the speed of light, come from violent astrophysical sources like supernovae and active galactic nuclei, but their detection is rare. For instance, the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina records only around 20 cosmic ray showers per year, and they can only detect cosmic rays from sources within approximately 100 megaparsecs (Mpc).\n\nNeutrinos, weakly interacting particles, can probe the dense interiors of compact objects like BNS systems, but the event count for such detections is typically low, as seen with observatories like IceCube. [2]\n\nBy combining these different messengers, MMA draws on diverse fields like particle physics, general relativity, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. The strengths of one messenger compensate for the limitations of another, providing a more complete view of the universe.

This method is particularly effective for investigating extreme events, such as mergers of binary neutron stars (BNS), neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers, eccentric binary coalescences, core-collapse supernovae.\nRecent joint discovery campaigns with optical detectors like the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), Euclid, and WFIRST, have advanced MMA by enabling the detection of GW events that are often accompanied by EM counterparts.[0]\nSome key breakthroughs in multimessenger astrophysics include:\n        \u2022        GW150914: Detected in 2015 by LIGO, this event marked the first detection of gravitational waves and confirmed the existence of binary black hole (BBH) systems.[1]\n        \u2022        GW170817: In 2017, this BNS merger was the first and only event to be detected with both gravitational waves and an electromagnetic counterpart. [2]\n        \u2022        IceCube-170922A: In 2017, IceCube detected a high-energy neutrino event traced back to the blazar TXS 0506+056, providing evidence that blazars are a source of high-energy neutrinos. This event marked the first time neutrino observations were used to locate an object in space.[3]\n        \u2022        IC191001A: A 2019 neutrino event attributed to a tidal disruption event (TDE), which occurs when a star passes too close to a supermassive black hole and is torn apart. This suggests TDEs may be a source of high-energy cosmic neutrinos.\nThese discoveries demonstrate the potential of MMA to reveal new insights into the universe through the combination of multiple observational channels.\n"}, {"input": "What challenges does the multi-messager astrophysics (MMA) approach currently meet for detecting astrophysical phenomena?", "ctxs": [{"title": "LSST Science Book, Version 2.0", "text": "Each patch of sky will be visited 1000 times (where a visit consists of two 15-second exposures back to back in a given filter) in ten years, producing a trillion line database with temporal astrometric and photometric data on 20 billion objects. The 30 terabytes of pipeline processed data (32 bit) obtained each night will open the time domain window on the deep optical universe for variability and motion. Rarely observed events will become commonplace, new and unanticipated phenomena will be discovered, and the combination of LSST with contemporary space-based nearinfrared (NIR) missions will provide powerful synergies in studies of dark energy, galaxy evolution, and many other areas. The deep coverage of ten billion galaxies provides unique capabilities for cosmology. Astrometry, six-band photometry, and time domain data on 10 billion stars will enable studies of Galactic structure. All LSST data and source code will be non-proprietary, with public accessibility and usability a high priority.

During the first observing run (O1), from September 12, 2015 to January 19, 2016, gravitational waves from three binary black hole mergers were detected. The second observing run (O2), which ran from November 30, 2016 to August 25, 2017, saw the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral, in addition to the observation of gravitational waves from a total of seven binary black hole mergers, four of which we report here for the first time: GW170729, GW170809, GW170818, and GW170823. For all significant gravitational-wave events, we provide estimates of the source properties. The detected binary black holes have total masses between 18.6\u00fe3.2 \u22120.7 M\u2299 and 84.4\u00fe15.8 \u221211.1 M\u2299 and range in distance between 320\u00fe120 \u2212110 and 2840\u00fe1400 \u22121360 Mpc. No neutron star\u2013black hole mergers were detected. In addition to highly significant gravitational-wave events, we also provide a list of marginal event candidates with an estimated false-alarm rate less than 1 per 30 days. From these results over the first two observing runs, which include approximately one gravitational-wave detection per 15 days of data searched, we infer merger rates at the 90% confidence intervals of 110 \u2212 3840 Gpc\u22123 y\u22121 for binary neutron stars and 9.7 \u2212 101 Gpc\u22123 y\u22121 for binary black holes assuming fixed population distributions and determine a neutron star\u2013black hole merger rate 90% upper limit of 610 Gpc\u22123 y\u22121.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b92b27b03183db64cebae502c5fa0d1bbe47eb18", "year": 2018, "authors": [{"authorId": "88691091", "name": "The Ligo Scientific Collaboration"}, {"authorId": "102856569", "name": "T.

Optimistic scenarios for on-axis gamma-attenuated emission are constrained by the present non-detection. While the location of this source was nearly ideal for Auger, it was well above the horizon for IceCube and ANTARES for prompt observations. This limited the sensitivity of the latter two detectors, particularly below \u223c 100 TeV. 19 For source locations near, or below the horizon, a factor of \u223c 10 increase in fluence sensitivity to prompt emission from an E\u22122 neutrino spectrum is expected.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93966e72d7d23e83418f9c2f83a1fcf054884e70", "year": 2017, "authors": [{"authorId": "49163647", "name": "A.

These facilities generate vast amounts of data that require comprehensive analysis using cutting-edge tools to unlock the full potential of MMA. However, the sheer volume of data poses significant challenges, leading to potential underutilization of the facilities. For instance, next-generation electromagnetic surveys will drastically expand the coverage area, increasing the volume of image data. Telescopes such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are expected to produce over 30 terabytes of data daily.[0] Similarly, the expanding network of LIGO detectors will probe larger regions of space, with anticipated binary neutron star (BNS) and binary black hole (BBH) merger rates ranging from 110-3840 Gpc^-3yr^-1 and 9.7-101 Gpc^-3yr^-1, respectively. The upper bound for neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers is estimated at 610 Gpc^-3yr^-1.[1]\nDespite the increase in MMA data, existing computational resources are already stretched thin, underscoring the need for more efficient algorithms and data analysis tools to make the most of MMA facilities. While compact binary coalescence events are expected to be \u201ctriple-messenger\u201d sources of gravitational waves (GW), photons, and neutrinos, only one joint detection of GW and electromagnetic (EM) signals has been observed\u2014BNS merger GW170817, with no associated neutrino detection, likely due to a large off-axis view.[2] Nevertheless, early EM observations from BNS or NSBH mergers provide crucial insights into ejected material and r-process nucleosynthesis. [3] This highlights the importance of prompt EM follow-up searches triggered by GW signals.\nHowever, current cyber infrastructure struggles to keep up with the speed and efficiency demands of MMA. In the case of GW170817, manual EM follow-up began eight hours after the BNS merger signal reached GW detectors,[4] by which time the EM sources were no longer observable. This underscores the need for issuing GW alerts as early as possible to enable timely multi-messenger follow-ups. For BNS or NSBH mergers, GWs can be detected up to 15 minutes before the merger in advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors,[5] meaning early detection could significantly improve multi-messenger search coordination and deepen our understanding of the astrophysical processes involved.\n"}, {"input": "How to realize Topology Optimization of Cavity-Based Second Harmonic Generation?", "ctxs": [{"title": "Cavity-enhanced second-harmonic generation via\nnonlinear-overlap optimization. \n", "text": "In this letter, we extend a recently proposed formulation for the scalable topology optimization\nof microcavities, where every pixel of the geometry is a degree of freedom, to the problem of\ndesigning wavelength-scale photonic structures for second harmonic generation (SHG).

As for the previous 1D nanobeam measurements, optical measurements were performed using a continuous-wave pump laser tuned to the optical cavity resonance (\u0394 = 0) to avoid optomechanical back-action cooling and damping (see \u201cMethods\u201d). Results of the optically induced heating and damping of the 10 GHz breathing-like mode of the 2D OMC cavity are displayed in Fig. 4b, c, respectively. In Fig. 4b, the inferred hot bath occupancy np (left vertical axis) and the corresponding bath temperature Tp (right vertical axis) are plotted versus intra-cavity photon number nc (lower horizontal axis) and the corresponding input power (upper horizontal axis). We find that the hot bath occupancy is accurately fit by the power law, . This is the same power-law scaling as found for 1D nanobeam OMCs in ref. 32 (red dashed line in Fig. 4b); however, the overall magnitude of the hot bath occupancy has substantially dropped for the quasi-2D cavity by a factor of 7.2. Using a modified thermal conductance model that assumes ballistic phonon transport and a power-law dependence on temperature consistent with our measurements, , FEM numerical simulations of the 1D and 2D cavity structures (see Supplementary Note 6) predict a greatly enhanced thermal conductance coefficient for the quasi-2D cavity \u03f52D/\u03f51D = 42. This yields a hot bath occupancy ratio between nanobeam and quasi-2D cavities of 6.2, in good correspondence to the measured value. In alignment with our design strategy, the reduction in mode heating according to this model is primarily the result of a geometric effect due to the fact that the quasi-2D cavity is connected to the surrounding chip structure over a larger in-plane solid angle than that of the 1D nanobeam and thus has a larger number of phonon modes to carry heat away (i.e., a larger thermal conductance).", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ae805fd80aa759491c18c1b88f31aa53c7d877e", "year": 2019, "authors": [{"authorId": "48353782", "name": "H.

Frequency fluctuation limited the usable lifetime of calibration measurements to less than 1 day, preventing us from effectively calibrating a cooling protocol. We suggest experimental modifications to improve frequency stability and implement cooling in Appendix I.

The superconducting qubit is a frequency-tunable planar transmon30,31, connected to the SAW device through a tunable inductor network that provides electronic control32 of the coupling strength g0 (see Supplementary Information). Qubit rotations about the X and Y axes in the Bloch sphere representation are performed using pulses on the microwave (XY) line, and Z-axis rotations are achieved by application of a flux bias current on the frequency-control (Z) line. We measure the qubit state using a dispersively coupled readout resonator (see Supplementary Information). The superconducting qubit is fabricated on a sapphire substrate with standard techniques (see Supplementary Information). The SAW resonator is fabricated separately on a lithium niobate substrate, a strong piezoelectric material commonly used for SAW devices8 . The SAW resonator comprises an interdigital transducer placed between two Bragg mirrors, designed to support a single SAW resonance in the mirror stop band8 (see Supplementary Information). The SAW wavelength \u03bb is set by the period of the metal lines that constitute the resonator; here, \u03bb=1 \u03bcm, which corresponds to a frequency of 4.0 GHz. At the experiment temperature, about 10 mK, both the SAWs and the qubit should be in their quantum ground states. The electromechanical properties of the SAW resonator are modelled using an equivalent electrical circuit with a complex, frequency-dependent acoustic admittance8 Ya(\u03c9) connected in parallel with an interdigital capacitance Ct=0.75 pF. The admittance includes the complete response of the SAW transducer and the interaction of the SAW with the mirrors. The strong electromechanical coupling coefficient of lithium niobate makes it feasible to strongly couple the SAW resonance to a standard transmon-style qubit (see Supplementary Information). The separate qubit and SAWresonator chips are connected together in a flip-chip assembly, in which the lithium niobate chip is inverted, aligned and affixed to the sapphire chip, and are separated vertically by about 7 \u03bcm (see Supplementary Information). Coupling between the two chips is achieved using two overlaid planar inductors, one on each chip. The coupling strength is controlled using a radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) tunable coupler32, where an externally controlled flux bias \u03a6 controls the path of the qubit current.

Adjusting g0 away from zero shortens the qubit lifetime and makes it strongly frequency-dependent, as the transducer converts electromagnetic energy from the qubit into acoustic waves. In Fig. 2, we demonstrate this with |g0|/2\u03c0 set to 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 MHz (all uncertainties are one standard deviation), where acoustic loss is the dominant decay channel for the qubit. We measure the qubit lifetime T1 as a function of qubit frequency, \u03c9ge/2\u03c0, and use it to obtain the quality factor Q\u2009=\u2009\u03c9geT1 and the corresponding loss 1/Q. We compare our measurements to the results of a numerical model8 based on the SAW resonator design with parameters fine-tuned to reproduce the frequency response observed in the qubit loss (see Supplementary Information). The SAW transducer itself can efficiently emit phonons over a wide range of frequencies, roughly from 3.8 GHz to 4.1 GHz, owing to its small number of finger pairs8 (20 pairs). The SAW mirror reflects acoustic waves efficiently in the mirror stop band from 3.96 GHz to 4.04 GHz. The resultant interference frustrates the transducer emission except when a resonance condition is met, in this case at the single SAW resonance frequency of \u03c9r/2\u03c0\u2009=\u20093.985 GHz. The resonator admittance near that resonance can be approximated by an equivalent resonant electrical circuit, which constitutes the Butterworth\u2013van Dyke model8. Outside the mirror stop band, the mirror reflection decreases rapidly, and the transducer is free to emit travelling phonons. The qubit sees this as increased loss, especially from 3.85 GHz to 3.90 GHz, where the transducer is most efficient. The ripples in the out-of-band mirror reflection arise from the finite extent of each mirror (500 lines). These features are clearly displayed in the measured qubit loss. The qubit also weakly couples to unidentified resonances near 3.8 GHz. The SAW resonance at 3.985 GHz can resonantly and rapidly exchange energy with the qubit. In subsequent experiments, we avoid unwanted qubit loss by usually keeping the coupling small and only increasing it when deliberately interacting with the SAW resonance.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36792e366ff25c759f9bf81789b167d27551deac", "year": 2018, "authors": [{"authorId": "11013775", "name": "K.

Various optical components such as modulators2, optical filters3,4, photodetectors5, arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs)6, and all-optical wavelength converters7 have successfully been demonstrated, showing that multiple functions can be effectively integrated in a single integrated photonic chip8. Considering Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology, the strong refractive index difference between Si and SiO2 allows the implementation of very small, single mode waveguide structures9. On one hand this enables dense on-chip device integration, but on the other side it makes efficient fiber-to-waveguide coupling particularly challenging because of the vast difference in the mode areas (\u224880 \u03bcm 2 for fibers and <0.2 \u03bcm 2 for SOI waveguides). Among the various proposed solutions, two different approaches have attracted most attention: edge-coupling and grating-coupling. By exploiting edge-coupling, insertion losses lower than 0.5\u2009dB can be achieved over a broad bandwidth (>100\u2009nm)10. Nevertheless, this technique requires complicated post-fabrication processes, such as high quality facet polishing, and high-resolution optical alignment, making it not suitable for wafer-level testing and high-volume manufacturing. Grating couplers (GC), on the other hand, represent a very attractive solution, since they can be placed anywhere on the chip, allowing simple wafer-scale automated testing1 and providing much wider alignment tolerance than that allowed by edge-coupling. The main drawbacks of standard uniform GC are their narrow bandwidth (usually between 30\u201340\u2009nm, less than half of edge-coupling solutions) and the relatively low coupling efficiency (CE), which is usually lower than 61%11. The relatively low CE can be attributed to two main factors: grating directionality and mode mismatch. Considering a beam coupling from the SOI waveguide to a fiber, a low grating directionality (\u224865%) means that a large percentage of the optical power incident on the GC is diffracted towards the substrate (\u224835%) instead of being sent towards the fiber. The mode mismatch limitation is due to the fact that the optical intensity profile radiated by a uniform grating shows an almost exponential-decay shape with a reduced overlap integral with the mode profile (almost Gaussian) of standard optical fibers11. Different solutions have been proposed in the literature to increase the directionality by reducing the power leakage to the substrate. They make use of different approaches, such as the use of either poly-Silicon over-layers12,13 or back-reflectors embedded in the substrate, e.g. distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs)11,14 and metallic mirrors15,16,17. All of these techniques enhance the GC directionality, but require additional fabrication steps, that sometimes even involve the use of non-CMOS-compatible materials. CE can also be increased by tailoring the amount of optical power scattered by each element of the grating, so as to reduce the mode mismatch between the radiated field profile and the optical mode in a single-mode fiber (SMF). This is generally achieved by varying either the etching depth18 or the fill-factor of each grating period11,12,16,17,19,20,21,22. Alternatively, the hole-size in fully-etched photonic crystals (PhC) may be varied along the grating, however this often requires more complex fabrication processes17,23. Apodized GC are generally designed by applying numerical techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GA), to optimize a simple starting-structure. These techniques, in addition to being computationally intensive and time-consuming, do not allow getting a real physical insight on why a particular apodization curve yields to a CE increase. In this paper, we start by discussing the physical principle underlying the design of apodized GC with optimal CE in Section 2 and then describe the fabrication procedure and experimental characterization results in Section 3. Counter-intuitively, the obtained GC achieves higher CE than GA-optimized designs reported in the literature that do not use back-reflectors and the reason for this will be clear by the end of the paper.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00748ec779ca08de4872d7cfea0a2cb1318018a8", "year": 2017, "authors": [{"authorId": "35183359", "name": "R.

The grating coupler has the advantage that it can be placed anywhere on a chip and allows wafer-scale testing of optical integrated system. When the light is coupled from a waveguide to a fiber, the light will not only radiates upwards to the fiber, but also radiates downwards into the substrate. The ratio between the power coupled upwards and downwards (up/down ratio) which is important on the coupling efficiency can be further improved. There are several methods to increase the up/down ratio. First, the use of an upper cladding layer on the thin film to increase the transmittance and reduce the reflectivity between the thin film and the upper cladding layer [16]. The most common upper material is silicon dioxide. Second, the thickness of buried oxide layer (D) below thin film can be carefully chosen. The power radiated upwards/downwards is a periodical function of D due to the interference effect, and so the upwards radiated power can be enhanced by a proper choice of D [17].

This enables large density integrated optical circuits, which can be fabricated by standard CMOS technology [1]. One of the drawbacks of the high index contrast is the large mismatch in mode size and shape between the fundamental mode of the SOI waveguide and the mode of the optical fiber making efficient coupling of light from fiber to waveguide an important issue. Several approaches are being envisaged in literature to overcome this problem. 3D taper structures can adiabatically transform the fiber waveguide mode to the mode of an SOI waveguide [2]. However, the definition of the taper requires gray scale lithography, which is difficult to control. An inverted taper approach uses only planar waveguide definition technology to make an adiabatic taper structure, however this type of devices requires a lensed or high numerical aperture fiber with reduced core size to obtain efficient coupling over a reasonable device length [3]. As proposed in literature, one dimensional [4] or two dimensional [5] grating structures can also be used to couple light from a fiber into an SOI waveguide. These grating couplers have the advantage of not requiring polished facets for coupling, which enables wafer scale testing of the integrated circuits. Devices are very compact and have a large optical bandwidth. Although one dimensional grating couplers are very polarization dependent, a polarization diversity scheme based on a two dimensional grating coupler can be used in practical applications [5]. The reported fiber coupling efficiency obtained with standard uniform grating structures is limited. In Ref. [5] 20% fiber coupling efficiency was experimentally obtained for a two dimensional grating coupler. In Ref. [6], a one dimensional grating structure with a theoretical coupling efficiency of 37% was designed, while experimentally 31% coupling efficiency was obtained. This moderate coupling efficiency is inherent to the device structure due to the substantial fraction of incident power that is diffracted towards the Silicon substrate and the mismatch in the field profile between the upwards diffracted light and the Gaussian fiber mode. In order to increase the efficiency of the grating coupler structure, different strategies can be followed. One strategy is to include a bottom mirror to redirect the downwards diffracted light. This can be a gold bottom mirror [7] or a DBR-type mirror [8]. A second strategy is to optimize the dimensions of the individual grating periods to match the profile of the diffracted light with that of the fiber mode [8], while in a third strategy slanted gratings are used to optimize the coupling efficiency [9]. Although high efficiencies can be obtained, the technology required for fabrication is not CMOS compatible or is very complex. Therefore, we present here a way to increase the coupling efficiency by simply adding an additional layer of poly-Silicon before grating definition. This additional poly-Silicon layer reshapes the grating structure which changes its diffraction properties to improve the fiber coupling efficiency.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4da55395b1ace394b0939c84b8262d0d9ab99f95", "year": 2006, "authors": [{"authorId": "102276773", "name": "G.

In order to achieve perfectly vertical coupling, Roelkens et al. introduced a grating structure with an extra slit in the SOI bus waveguide to block the second-order back reflection wave [18]. However, the wavelength of operation with low back reflection is limited. Covey and Chen proposed a grating structure for coupling between a multi-slotted waveguide and a vertical fiber [19]. In this configuration, a distributed Bragg reflection grating (DBR) is needed to break the in-plane symmetry in order to achieve high directionality and thus coupling efficiency. The use of DBR may increase design complexity and device footprint. Here, we propose an efficient perfectly vertical silicon-chip-to-fiber coupling structure, which consists of two layers of silicon gratings with an inter-layer lateral shift to mimic 45\u00b0 tilted mirror reflection behavior. Our analysis shows that >78% of the power in silicon waveguides can be directed upwards for the entire wavelength range from 1500 nm to 1600 nm in our simulations. A peak coupling efficiency ~70% from a silicon waveguide into a perfectly vertical fiber at a wavelength of ~1550 nm can be achieved. The results we demonstrate here may find great applications in future photonic integration technology.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c57f460f694f0f0f6485d419173a19de922a44d2", "year": 2015, "authors": [{"authorId": "2053949614", "name": "M.

Apodizing the gratings can provide high efficiency grating couplers.  Apodized grating couplers are generally designed by applying numerical techniques to optimize a simple starting-structure, where the gratings are fully etched but each of the grating length/width is individually tuned to generate the overall high coupling efficiency [0]. This kind of grating coupler design is easy to fabricate but computationally intensive, which is normally performed with gradiant-based algorithms and least-square discretization procedure [1].\n2. The grating coupler deisgn can also improved by employing special physical properties of the gratings, e.g., unidirectional guided resonances. The unidirectional guided resonances are enabled by topological charges and prevent the downward radiation from this resoance as its far-filed polarization vanishes, while the upward radiantion is preserved [2]. This unique mechanism can be implemented for high efficiency grating coupler with wide workable wavelength span and large incident angle range [3], \n3. Add a bottom reflector can be another way to improve the grating coupler efficiency. An improtant aspect of the grating coupler loss is that a majority of the optical power is reflected downward into the substrate and dissipates. Adding a nottom reflectors such as a distributed bragg mirror [4] and metal mirror [5] can prevent the downward radiation and increase the energy efficiency.\n4. Index engineering with the upper layers of the grating couplers can also provide benefit for efficiency enhancement, which can be realized by either additional thin film overlay [6] or making dual-layer layer gratings in the vertical direction [7]. The additional layers reshape the grating coupler mode profile and change its diffraction properties to improve the fiber coupling efficiency.  \n"}, {"input": "What are ways to modulate the gigahertz surface acoustic waves?", "ctxs": [{"title": "Thermal Modulation of Gigahertz Surface Acoustic Waves on Lithium Niobate", "text": "Here, we demonstrate stable and efficient modulation of acoustic waves propagating on both bulk and thin-film LN-on-sapphire (LNSa) [40] substrates.

Achieving significant coupling between qubits and mechanical oscillators poses a challenge within the established paradigm pursued in most recent circuit quantum acoustodynamics (cQAD) efforts, where piezoelectricity mediates resonant coupling between a weakly anharmonic transmon qubit and a mechanical oscillator [12\u201329]. Most of these demonstrations operate at frequencies between 2 and 8 gigahertz. Seeking to operate at lower mechanical frequencies effectively compels us to move to a different type of qubit [11,30\u201332] to avoid diminishing coupling rates\u2014particularly for nanomechanical oscillators that have minimal gate capacitance. Our work shows that a substantial qubit-mechanics coupling rate can be achieved at lower frequency by using a fluxonium qubit. We show that the resulting large dispersive interaction rates, exceeding the decoherence rates of both systems, enable phonon-number-resolved measurements of mechanical resonators through the fluxonium and time-dependent coherence measurements of the oscillator. Remarkably, we are able to achieve large dispersive cooperativities despite observing comparable mechanical dissipation and working at a large detuning ( \u0394/\ud835\udc54\u227310) compared to previous cQAD demonstrations.

The absence of alternating currents from the driving field in this scheme eliminates conductive loss, allowing us to achieve large parametrically enhanced coupling rates without causing heating in the system. To further enhance electromechanical interactions, we rely on frequency-tunable high-impedance microwave resonators made from TiN superinductors.

This procedure effectively uses an additional acoustic mode to cool the qubit to an excited-state population of about 2%. The qubit is then excited with a \u03c0 pulse and brought into resonance with the l1 mode to transfer its energy into the acoustic resonator using a swap operation. This is repeated N times to climb up the Fock state ladder and ideally results in a state of N phonons, which is then probed by bringing the qubit and phonon to resonance for a variable time t and measuring the final qubit state.

However, detecting the enzyme-reactant interactions and associated conformational changes of the enzyme on a single-molecule basis remains as a challenge to established optical techniques because of the commonly required labeling of the reactants or the enzyme itself. The labeling process is usually nontrivial, and the labels themselves might skew the physical properties of the enzyme.

In both approaches, we find that low and high polymerase activities can be clearly discerned through their characteristic signal amplitude and signal length distributions.

Our antenna-in-a-nanocavity system is a hybrid of both ultrasmall V from plasmonics and high Q from the one-dimensional photonic crystal nanobeam cavities, offering simultaneously ultrasmall V and high Q. The enhancement in Q/V brings the sensitivity to the single-molecule level with high signal fidelity. ......Trapping gold nanoparticles has been demonstrated in photonic crystal nanocavities by different groups including us (42\u201344). The trapping is achieved by delivering the gold nanoparticles to the vicinity of the photonic crystal nanocavity through a microfluidic channel while scanning the laser at its resonance. The maximum field intensity accessible to the gold nanoparticle is located at the corners of the gratings. Once the nanoparticle is pulled to the field maximum, it sticks to the corner wall of the photonic crystal nanobeam cavity, as shown in Fig. 1C. The trapping event is indicated by a discrete resonance jump to the longer wavelength (by ~440 pm) and a drop in the Q-factor (from 1.0 \u00d7 105 to 8.2 \u00d7 103), as shown in Fig. 1F (setup shown in fig. S1). In the presence of the gold nanoparticle, the cavity photons excite collective oscillations of the surface electrons of the gold nanoparticle, creating a strong electromagnetic field at the gap between the nanoparticle and the silicon side wall (Fig. 1H). The cavity photons become polaritons, leading to a further reduced mode volume of the antenna-in-a-nanocavity hybrid system (V = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124\u03bb3). This significant reduction in mode volume increases the resonance shift by ~280 times from a bare photonic crystal nanobeam cavity. In the present case, the cavity photons are detuned from the surface plasmon resonance of the gold nanoparticle antenna; thus, heating effect is reduced. Another ~20-fold enhancement could be achieved (on top of 280) if probe photons are at the antenna resonance. However, temperature rise will increase by a factor of ~500 due to resonant enhancement of electron ohmic loss; thus, input power level needs to be significantly reduced to avoid excess temperature increase (fig.

Equally important is the ability to precisely and accurately measure the spectral shift that results from the sample. Here we introduce the concept of the sensor resolution, which characterizes the smallest possible spectral shift that can be accurately measured. As described later, this term takes into account the spectral resolution of the system and a number of noise parameters. The sensitivity (S) and the sensor resolution (R) combine to form the detection limit (DL) of the device......Figure 2(B) plots the three standard deviations (3\u03c3) value of the determined maxima for SNRs ranging from 20 dB to 80 dB, and for Q-factors between 10^3 and 10^8. The inset shows a numerically generated probability density function (PDF) for the relative spectral position of the maximum value for a particular simulation run. The PDF is similar to a Gaussian distribution. The simulation results reveal that having a high Q-factor is advantageous in reducing the spectral noise of the sensor. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the noise signal results in a finite probability for samples within the optical bandwidth of the resonant mode to be identified as the extremum [see Fig. 2(A)]. Resonant modes with narrower linewidth filter the spectral noise more effectively, which leads to lower spectral deviation from the actual center of the mode. As a result, Q-factor plays an important role in the DL of the sensor.......In this analysis, the sensitivity is a combination of the spectral shift of the resonant mode and of the slope of the spectral mode profile (and thus the Q-factor).

We propose here to operate such sensors at so-called exceptional points, which are degeneracies in open wave and quantum systems where at least two resonant frequencies or energy levels and the corresponding eigenstates coalesce. We argue that this has great potential for enhanced sensitivity provided that one is able to measure both the frequency splitting as well as the linewidth splitting. We apply this concept to a microcavity sensor for single-particle detection. An analytical theory and numerical simulations prove a more than threefold enhanced sensitivity.

High-quality optical microcavities are prime candidates for sensing applications because of their ability to enhance light\u2013matter interactions in a very confined volume. Examples of such devices include mechanical transducers, magnetometers, single-particle absorption spectrometers, and microcavity sensors for sizing single particles and detecting nanometre-scale objects such as single nanoparticles and atomic ions. Traditionally, a very small perturbation near an optical microcavity introduces either a change in the linewidth or a frequency shift or splitting of a resonance that is proportional to the strength of the perturbation. Here we demonstrate an alternative sensing scheme, by which the sensitivity of microcavities can be enhanced when operated at non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies known as exceptional points. In our experiments, we use two nanoscale scatterers to tune a whispering-gallery-mode micro-toroid cavity, in which light propagates along a concave surface by continuous total internal reflection, in a precise and controlled manner to exceptional points. A target nanoscale object that subsequently enters the evanescent field of the cavity perturbs the system from its exceptional point, leading to frequency splitting. Owing to the complex-square-root topology near an exceptional point, this frequency splitting scales as the square root of the perturbation strength and is therefore larger (for sufficiently small perturbations) than the splitting observed in traditional non-exceptional-point sensing schemes. Our demonstration of exceptional-point-enhanced sensitivity paves the way for sensors with unprecedented sensitivity.\n", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8850a2e0b9bda722cdd5a05cc9e0ac1e780f817c", "year": 2017, "authors": [{"authorId": "123106705", "name": "Weijian Chen"}, {"authorId": "31428682", "name": "\u015e. \u00d6zdemir"}, {"authorId": "48665441", "name": "Guangming Zhao"}, {"authorId": "1829117", "name": "J.

We propose a novel approach to EPs based on spatial symmetry breaking and report their observation in plasmonics at room temperature. The plasmonic EPs are based on the hybridization of detuned resonances in multilayered plasmonic structures to reach a critical complex coupling rate between nanoantenna arrays, resulting in the simultaneous coalescence of the resonances and loss rates.

When a particle approaches the surface of the sensor silica ring, it couples to the resonator\u2019s evanescent field. As a result, some photons are scattered out of the cavity entirely, while others remain in the cavity but with reversed direction, from CW to CCW or vice versa. The scattering breaks the symmetry and lifts the degeneracy of the resonator\u2019s eigenmodes. Typically, the resonant frequency splitting is proportional to the strength of the perturbation for a hypothetical complex-valued perturbation \u03b5. Because the shape of the topology resembles a yo-yo-like toy called a diabolo, the degeneracy is termed a diabolic point (DP). It has been demonstrated recently that the sensitivity can be enhanced by a new sensing scheme based on the non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs) [0] [1]. At EPs, not only do resonant frequencies (eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian) coincide but their resonant modes (corresponding eigenvectors) are also matched. Perturbing a system about an EP splits the degenerate mode in two, and the frequency splitting scales with the square root of the strength of the perturbation [2]. Therefore, the frequency splitting is larger than (for sufficiently small perturbations) that observed in traditional non-EP sensing schemes.\n\nYang and colleagues have used a WGM sensor tuned to an EP to detect a polystyrene NP with twice the sensitivity of a DP sensor [3]. The sensor was prepared into the EP by bringing two silica nanotips close to the microtoroids with fine placement, such that they could scatter light from the CW wave into the CCW wave but not the other way around. Therefore, the system exhibits fully asymmetric internal backscattering that does not lead to frequency splitting. The intrinsic backscattering together with the backscattering induced by the target NP results in the enhanced complex frequency splitting, proportional to \ud835\udec6\u221a. The EP sensor hence produces a larger frequency split than the DP sensor does subject to the same NPs.\n\nKant\u00e9 and colleagues recently reported EPs in plasmonics and demonstrated that the plasmonic EP enables enhanced sensing of anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG) [4]. Their system consists of a bilayer plasmonic structure made of two optically dissimilar plasmonic resonators array with detuned resonances. The hybridization of detuned resonators leads to two hybrid modes with crossing and avoided crossing of both the resonance frequencies and loss rates, signaling the existence of a plasmonic EP. Resonance splitting for different concentrations of anti-mouse IgG for DP and EP sensors obey a linear and square-root law, respectively. Larger splitting of resonances was observed for the EP sensor compared with the DP sensor for IgG concentrations smaller than 1 fM.

Real-time video recording reveals that both ends of a microtubule exist in either the growing or the shortening phase and alternate quite frequently between the two phases in a stochastic manner.

We find no correlation in the phase conversion either among individual microtubules or between the two ends of a single microtubule. The two ends of any given microtubule have remarkably different characteristics; the active end grows faster, alternates in phase more frequently and fluctuates in length to a greater extent than the inactive end.

Despite the sensitivity of conventional optical phase contrast microscopy, the image contrast for thin samples can be insufficient for visualization. By combining phase contrast microscopy with plasmonic metasurfaces, Balaur et al. developed a ptychographic phase microscopy in which silver-coated metasurfaces were utilized as the substrate for imaging [1]. By carefully designing the structure and periodicity of the unit cell, the authors exploited the nonlinear optical response in both the amplitude and phase of light transmitting through the metasurfaces for the enhancement of signal contrast. Through label-free sample demonstration using both ultra-thin samples (<100 nm thick) and 4 \u00b5m thick breast tissue, a substantial increase in phase contrast can be observed in comparison with conventional ptychography.\nAnother application of metasurfaces in the development of phase contrast microscopy is to achieve miniaturization of the imaging system. Conventional quantitative phase imaging (QPI) techniques, despite their outstanding performance, are based on interferometry, thus requiring large and complex optical components, which can limit the applicability of QPI. By virtue of the polarization and spatial multiplexing capabilities of metasurfaces, Kwon et al. proposed a compact single-shot quantitative phase microscope in which two cascaded silicon metasurface layers were deployed to simultaneously achieve lateral shearing, phase shifting, and imaging [2]. With the cascaded metasurfaces, the fundamental limits imposed by refraction-based optics can be overcome and consequently, the overall volume of the miniaturized QPI system was reduced to 0.62 \u00d7 0.41 \u00d7 1.00 mm\u00b3 by integrating the two metasurfaces onto a single double-sided metamaterial. Using the metasurfaces, three differential interference contrast (DIC) images can be obtained simultaneously, which can then be used to retrieve the quantitative phase information of the sample under observation [2]. The miniaturized phase imaging system offers great potential for point-of-care phase imaging systems including microscopes and endoscopes.  \n\nRefractometric Microscopy:\n\nPreviously, a spectrometer was leveraged to monitor the resonance wavelength or the reflection intensity shift from a confined region and to sense analyte binding to the metasurfaces. More recently, the combination of high Q-factors supported by metasurfaces and imaging-based data acquisition has been studied to realize massively parallel sensing with high spatial and spectral resolution.\nAltug and colleagues have developed a spectrometer-free optofluidic biosensor based on dielectric metasurfaces utilizing single-wavelength imaging [3]. This method includes supporting a diatomic dielectric metasurface that provides a quasi-bound state in continuum (BIC) mode, allowing high-quality resonance with accessible near-fields through the destruction of in-plane symmetry. The large-area metasurface chip is configured as a microarray and integrated with microfluidics on the imaging platform for real-time detection of breast cancer extracellular vesicles containing exosomes [4]. In addition, the same research group developed a variety of detection methods for related biomarkers of inflammatory diseases. They reported a bright-field imaging plasmonic biosensor that allows visualization of single subwavelength gold nanoparticles (NPs) on large-area gold nanohole arrays (Au-NHAs). The sensor generates image heatmaps that reveal the locations of single NPs as high-contrast spikes, enabling the detection of individual NP-labeled molecules [5]. They implemented the method in a sandwich immunoassay for the detection of biotinylated bovine serum albumin (bBSA) and human C-reactive protein (CRP), a clinical biomarker of acute inflammatory disease. On this basis, they optimized and developed a portable biosensor based on nanoparticle-enhanced digital plasmonic imaging for rapid and sensitive detection of two sepsis-related inflammatory biomarkers from blood serum [6].   Apart from biomolecular detection and imaging, metasurface-based refractometric microscopy is also applied in the label-free observation of cell morphology. Photonic-crystal-enhanced microscopy (PCEM) has been demonstrated as a versatile platform for quantification and imaging of cell-surface interactions, such as stem-cell differentiation, invasion, chemotaxis, and apoptosis [7] [8] [9]"}, {"input": "How can all-dielectri photonics crystal enhance fluorescence?

However, the periodicity also allows for phase-matching of higher (evanescent) orders to localized leaky modes supported by the PC. Once excited, the leaky modes, defined by a complex propagation constant, possess a finite lifetime as they are diffracted in both the forward (transmitted) and backward (specular) directions. The backward re-radiated waves are in phase and constructively interfere with the zeroth backward-diffracted order, whereas the forward re-radiated waves are out of phase with the zeroth forward-diffracted order by \u03c0 radians31, causing destructive interference and consequently zero transmission. Thus, the external excitation of leaky modes is associated with a 100% reflection phenomenon for a resonant wavelength, assuming a defect-free, lossless system. As the excited leaky modes are localized in space during their finite lifetimes, they can be engineered to have very high energy density within regions of the PC at resonance. The magnitude of this energy density is directly related to the resonant mode lifetime or Q-factor of resonance, which in turn can be controlled by adjusting the device parameters. The intensity of emission of fluorescent species (which are absorptive at the resonant wavelengths) can be greatly enhanced by placing them in proximity to regions where the resonant modes concentrate most of their energy.\n\nThe existence of leaky modes overlapping the fluorescence emission spectrum opens up pathways for the emitted light to escape into free space. As well as direct emission, the fluorescence can now couple to the overlapping leaky modes and Bragg scatter out of the structure, thereby greatly reducing the amount of light trapped as guided modes compared with an unpatterned substrate. If the dispersion of these overlapping leaky modes is close to the \u0393-point band edge, that is, K\u2016 (magnitude of the in-plane wave vector) \u223c 0, most of the emitted light will be extracted within small angles to the surface normal. More generally, appropriately engineering the leaky dispersion of the PC facilitates the funnelling of guided light into regions of space where it can be easily detected. It can thus be appreciated that enhancement of fluorescence can be achieved in two steps: enhanced excitation and enhanced extraction.\n\n", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b41679169d47b5317016598f8876fc58a875590", "year": 2007, "authors": [{"authorId": "120344358", "name": "N.

The enhanced excitation mechanism enables substantial absorption of the pump energy for QDs within the vicinity of the PC surface and generates more photons than the same QDs in contact with an unpatterned glass surface. Second, the QD emission light couples with the PC fluorescent mode and radiates into the far-field at a higher extraction rate, so that more photons are captured during a single image integration time. Third, the dielectric PC produces a quantum efficiency enhancement through the Purcell effect, which results in reduced spontaneous emission lifetime and higher quantum efficiency. Fourth, the PC resonant modes provide a photonic dispersion that dictates the highly directional photon angular distribution in free space. The directional emission mechanism ensures greater photon collection efficiency from the PC, through strategic selection of a microscope objective whose NA incorporates the angles for a known QD emission wavelength.

This Purcell effect enhances QD emission by modifying quantum efficiency (QE) without increasing the non-radiative decay rate due to the lossless nature of dielectric materials. The improved emission rate corresponds to the lateral position of the QD on the PC surface and is consistent over a broad wavelength range for single emitters. In comparison to a solitary QD, the local density of available photon states is higher in the QD-PC-coupled system. An excited-state QD will transition to the ground state with a rapid radiative decay rate and emit photons.

However, newer methods of cDNA synthesis, specifically the use of miR-specific stem- loop primers, avoid the need for precedent fractionation and can distinguish between different miR forms (54). The miR-specific primers may also possess a linear segment in place of a stem- loop structure at their 5\u2032-end, although both of these variants contain an miR antisense portion of approximately 6\u20138 nucleotides on their 3\u2032-end. Independent of structure, the 5\u2032-end contains a common sequence for priming qPCR (9, 10, 50). Although the linear primers are easier to design, the stem-loop primers are better at specifically targeting the mature miR form, and thus provide enhanced specificity and reduced qPCR background. Although this is beneficial for getting more accurate quantitation of mature miR, it does hinder the RT of isomiR sequences (9). In both cases, RT primers should be designed such that annealing can be done at lower temperatures (usually 16\u25e6 C), as this helps preserve pri-/pre-miR secondary structures (thus keeping the template sequence sequestered) and thereby reduce RT of those longer, potentially unwanted miR forms (50). In contrast to using miR-specific primers, the second method uses a universal RT primer to synthesize cDNA. This is done in one of two ways. In the first, PAP is used to extend the miR population with a polyA tail. An RT primer containing a universal qPCR primer sequence followed by a polyT segment then binds to the extended miR for cDNA synthesis\u2014the number of thymine residues incorporated in the cDNA is selected for by aligning the RT primer to the 3\u2032-end of the miR using degenerate bases (usually three) that can base pair with more than one base. A downside to this method is that PAP extends all RNAs in the sample, including pri-/pre- miR sequences, and it does not allow for optimized primers for miR sets with widely varying Tms (50). In the second universal method, T4 ligase is used to ligate a common sequence to all miRs in the sample and then cDNA is synthesized with a universal RT primer. The use of these common sequence RT methods shifts the selection process for mature forms of miR to the qPCR step, which we discuss below. Another novel method of cDNA synthesis worth mentioning is the RT method used in miR-ID. In this method, miR in the sample is circularized through intermolecular ligation and reverse transcribed to produce tandem repeats of the cDNA sequence. This approach allows for great control over qPCR primer placement to distinguish between miR forms (55).", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/236d66cfa9b1e899400b3143f37db4eb3d2020d7", "year": 2015, "authors": [{"authorId": "10900258", "name": "Eric A.

By fabricating two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs that operate at visible wavelengths and engineering their leaky modes so that they overlap with the absorption and emission wavelengths of the quantum dots, we demonstrate that the fluorescence intensity can be enhanced by a factor of up to 108 compared with quantum dots on an unpatterned surface.\n", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b41679169d47b5317016598f8876fc58a875590", "year": 2007, "authors": [{"authorId": "120344358", "name": "N.

Three-dimensional PC structures have also been used to enhance fluorescence. Song et al. spin-coated a Ru dye layer on 3D opal PCs composed of multilayers of PMMA spheres to achieve ~320-fold luminescence enhancement with dual-stopband configurations [4]. Xiong et al. report a nearly 3000-fold signal enhancement achieved through multiplicative effects of enhanced excitation, highly directional extraction, quantum efficiency improvement, and blinking suppression through a photonic crystal surface. The approach achieves single quantum dot sensitivity with high signal-to-noise ratio, even when using a low-NA lens and an inexpensive optical setup. The blinking suppression capability of the PC improves the QDs on-time from 15% to 85% ameliorating signal intermittency. We developed an assay for cancer-associated miRNA biomarkers with single-molecule resolution, single-base mutation selectivity, and 10-attomolar detection limit.

The hybrid photonic-plasmonic modes due to the coupling of the narrowband WGM with the plasmon resonance feature significant electric field enhancement on the NP surface (Figure 2b) and can be efficiently excited in a wide frequency range covering the longer-wavelength slope of the NP LSP resonance peak . Indeed, our calculations in Figure 2b show up to 3 orders-of-magnitude increase of the electric field intensity on the NP surface. Strong WGM coupling to the NP collective electron oscillations at the frequencies close to the NP dipole LSP resonance increases both radiative and dissipative losses, resulting in the decrease of the Q-factors of hybrid modes in the 520-580 nm frequency range (Figure 2c).

The labeling process is usually nontrivial, and the labels themselves might skew the physical properties of the enzyme.

Our antenna-in-a-nanocavity system is a hybrid of both ultrasmall V from plasmonics and high Q from the one-dimensional photonic crystal nanobeam cavities, offering simultaneously ultrasmall V and high Q. The enhancement in Q/V brings the sensitivity to the single-molecule level with high signal fidelity. ......Trapping gold nanoparticles has been demonstrated in photonic crystal nanocavities by different groups including us (42\u201344). The trapping is achieved by delivering the gold nanoparticles to the vicinity of the photonic crystal nanocavity through a microfluidic channel while scanning the laser at its resonance. The maximum field intensity accessible to the gold nanoparticle is located at the corners of the gratings. Once the nanoparticle is pulled to the field maximum, it sticks to the corner wall of the photonic crystal nanobeam cavity, as shown in Fig. 1C. The trapping event is indicated by a discrete resonance jump to the longer wavelength (by ~440 pm) and a drop in the Q-factor (from 1.0 \u00d7 105 to 8.2 \u00d7 103), as shown in Fig. 1F (setup shown in fig. S1). In the presence of the gold nanoparticle, the cavity photons excite collective oscillations of the surface electrons of the gold nanoparticle, creating a strong electromagnetic field at the gap between the nanoparticle and the silicon side wall (Fig. 1H). The cavity photons become polaritons, leading to a further reduced mode volume of the antenna-in-a-nanocavity hybrid system (V = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124\u03bb3). This significant reduction in mode volume increases the resonance shift by ~280 times from a bare photonic crystal nanobeam cavity. In the present case, the cavity photons are detuned from the surface plasmon resonance of the gold nanoparticle antenna; thus, heating effect is reduced. Another ~20-fold enhancement could be achieved (on top of 280) if probe photons are at the antenna resonance. However, temperature rise will increase by a factor of ~500 due to resonant enhancement of electron ohmic loss; thus, input power level needs to be significantly reduced to avoid excess temperature increase (fig.

Here we introduce the concept of the sensor resolution, which characterizes the smallest possible spectral shift that can be accurately measured. As described later, this term takes into account the spectral resolution of the system and a number of noise parameters.

The inset shows a numerically generated probability density function (PDF) for the relative spectral position of the maximum value for a particular simulation run. The PDF is similar to a Gaussian distribution. The simulation results reveal that having a high Q-factor is advantageous in reducing the spectral noise of the sensor. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the noise signal results in a finite probability for samples within the optical bandwidth of the resonant mode to be identified as the extremum [see Fig. 2(A)]. Resonant modes with narrower linewidth filter the spectral noise more effectively, which leads to lower spectral deviation from the actual center of the mode. As a result, Q-factor plays an important role in the DL of the sensor.......In this analysis, the sensitivity is a combination of the spectral shift of the resonant mode and of the slope of the spectral mode profile (and thus the Q-factor).

At first, this leads to heating (instead of cooling), enhancing the oscillator\u2019s effective temperature. Once the overall damping rate \u0393m + \u0393opt becomes negative, an instability ensues. In that case, any small initial (e.g., thermal) fluctuation will at first grow exponentially in time. Later, nonlinear effects will saturate the growth of the mechanical oscillation amplitude (Fig. 37). A steady-state regime is reached, with oscillations proceeding at a fixed amplitude A. These are called self-induced (backaction-induced) optomechanical oscillations. In fact, they are analogous to the lasing action, but now in a mechanical system and with the incoming laser radiation providing the pump.....The nonlinear dynamics of the self-oscillations (mechanical lasing, Sec. VIII) become particularly interesting when more mechanical modes are involved.

To date, the highest resolution reported is a resonance shift of (\u03b4\u03bb/\u03bb0)=3 \u00d7 10^\u221210 achieved with an optical Q of one hundred million at a visible wavelength in an aqueous environment[1], which, however, is still larger than that induced by a single protein binding event [2]. Consequently, detection of a single protein molecule down to 1\u2009kDa requires incorporating a plasmonic nanoantenna on the microcavity to enhance the resonance wavelength shift [3], at the price of a significant reduction of the effective detection area. \n\nOn the other hand, cavity optomechanics was explored to dramatically enhance the resolution of WGM sensors without compromising the effective detection area.[4] The optical wave cycling inside the microcavity produces a radiation pressure that interacts with the mechanical motion of the device. When the excitation laser is blue-detuned to the cavity resonance, the optical wave can efficiently boost the mechanical motion above the threshold, resulting in highly coherent optomechanical oscillation (OMO) with a narrow mechanical linewidth.[5]The OMO frequency is in the microwave range and is directly dependent on the laser\u2013cavity detuning. Therefore, any perturbation to the cavity optical resonance frequency induced by molecules binding will be readily transferred to the frequency shift of the mechanical motion. The sensing resolution scales not only with optical Q of the cavity as in conventional microcavity sensors, but also with the effective mechanical Q of the OMO.

A seemingly unrelated phenomenon is the exceptional point, also known as the parity\u2013time symmetry breaking point, where two resonances coincide in both their positions and widths. Exceptional points lead to counter-intuitive phenomena such as loss-induced transparency, unidirectional transmission or reflection, and lasers with reversed pump dependence or single-mode operation. Dirac cones and exceptional points are connected: it was theoretically suggested that certain non-Hermitian perturbations can deform a Dirac cone and spawn a ring of exceptional points.

Angle-resolved reflection measurements of the photonic crystal slab reveal that the peaks of reflectivity follow the conical band structure of a Dirac cone resulting from accidental degeneracy, whereas the complex eigenvalues of the system are deformed into a two-dimensional flat band enclosed by an exceptional ring. This deformation arises from the dissimilar radiation rates of dipole and quadrupole resonances, which play a role analogous to the loss and gain in parity\u2013time symmetric systems.

Examples of such devices include mechanical transducers, magnetometers, single-particle absorption spectrometers, and microcavity sensors for sizing single particles and detecting nanometre-scale objects such as single nanoparticles and atomic ions. Traditionally, a very small perturbation near an optical microcavity introduces either a change in the linewidth or a frequency shift or splitting of a resonance that is proportional to the strength of the perturbation. Here we demonstrate an alternative sensing scheme, by which the sensitivity of microcavities can be enhanced when operated at non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies known as exceptional points. In our experiments, we use two nanoscale scatterers to tune a whispering-gallery-mode micro-toroid cavity, in which light propagates along a concave surface by continuous total internal reflection, in a precise and controlled manner to exceptional points. A target nanoscale object that subsequently enters the evanescent field of the cavity perturbs the system from its exceptional point, leading to frequency splitting. Owing to the complex-square-root topology near an exceptional point, this frequency splitting scales as the square root of the perturbation strength and is therefore larger (for sufficiently small perturbations) than the splitting observed in traditional non-exceptional-point sensing schemes.

When a particle approaches the surface of the sensor silica ring, it couples to the resonator\u2019s evanescent field. As a result, some photons are scattered out of the cavity entirely, while others remain in the cavity but with reversed direction, from CW to CCW or vice versa. The scattering breaks the symmetry and lifts the degeneracy of the resonator\u2019s eigenmodes. Typically, the resonant frequency splitting is proportional to the strength of the perturbation for a hypothetical complex-valued perturbation \u03b5. Because the shape of the topology resembles a yo-yo-like toy called a diabolo, the degeneracy is termed a diabolic point (DP). It has been demonstrated recently that the sensitivity can be enhanced by a new sensing scheme based on the non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs) [0] [1]. At EPs, not only do resonant frequencies (eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian) coincide but their resonant modes (corresponding eigenvectors) are also matched. Perturbing a system about an EP splits the degenerate mode in two, and the frequency splitting scales with the square root of the strength of the perturbation [2]. Therefore, the frequency splitting is larger than (for sufficiently small perturbations) that observed in traditional non-EP sensing schemes.\n\nYang and colleagues have used a WGM sensor tuned to an EP to detect a polystyrene NP with twice the sensitivity of a DP sensor [3]. The sensor was prepared into the EP by bringing two silica nanotips close to the microtoroids with fine placement, such that they could scatter light from the CW wave into the CCW wave but not the other way around. Therefore, the system exhibits fully asymmetric internal backscattering that does not lead to frequency splitting. The intrinsic backscattering together with the backscattering induced by the target NP results in the enhanced complex frequency splitting, proportional to \ud835\udec6\u221a. The EP sensor hence produces a larger frequency split than the DP sensor does subject to the same NPs.\n\nKant\u00e9 and colleagues recently reported EPs in plasmonics and demonstrated that the plasmonic EP enables enhanced sensing of anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG) [4]. Their system consists of a bilayer plasmonic structure made of two optically dissimilar plasmonic resonators array with detuned resonances. The hybridization of detuned resonators leads to two hybrid modes with crossing and avoided crossing of both the resonance frequencies and loss rates, signaling the existence of a plasmonic EP. Resonance splitting for different concentrations of anti-mouse IgG for DP and EP sensors obey a linear and square-root law, respectively. Larger splitting of resonances was observed for the EP sensor compared with the DP sensor for IgG concentrations smaller than 1 fM.

Real-time video recording reveals that both ends of a microtubule exist in either the growing or the shortening phase and alternate quite frequently between the two phases in a stochastic manner. Moreover, growing and shortening ends can coexist on a single microtubule, one end continuing to grow simultaneously with shortening at the other end. We find no correlation in the phase conversion either among individual microtubules or between the two ends of a single microtubule. The two ends of any given microtubule have remarkably different characteristics; the active end grows faster, alternates in phase more frequently and fluctuates in length to a greater extent than the inactive end.

Despite the sensitivity of conventional optical phase contrast microscopy, the image contrast for thin samples can be insufficient for visualization. By combining phase contrast microscopy with plasmonic metasurfaces, Balaur et al. developed a ptychographic phase microscopy in which silver-coated metasurfaces were utilized as the substrate for imaging [1]. By carefully designing the structure and periodicity of the unit cell, the authors exploited the nonlinear optical response in both the amplitude and phase of light transmitting through the metasurfaces for the enhancement of signal contrast. Through label-free sample demonstration using both ultra-thin samples (<100 nm thick) and 4 \u00b5m thick breast tissue, a substantial increase in phase contrast can be observed in comparison with conventional ptychography.\nAnother application of metasurfaces in the development of phase contrast microscopy is to achieve miniaturization of the imaging system. Conventional quantitative phase imaging (QPI) techniques, despite their outstanding performance, are based on interferometry, thus requiring large and complex optical components, which can limit the applicability of QPI. By virtue of the polarization and spatial multiplexing capabilities of metasurfaces, Kwon et al. proposed a compact single-shot quantitative phase microscope in which two cascaded silicon metasurface layers were deployed to simultaneously achieve lateral shearing, phase shifting, and imaging [2]. With the cascaded metasurfaces, the fundamental limits imposed by refraction-based optics can be overcome and consequently, the overall volume of the miniaturized QPI system was reduced to 0.62 \u00d7 0.41 \u00d7 1.00 mm\u00b3 by integrating the two metasurfaces onto a single double-sided metamaterial. Using the metasurfaces, three differential interference contrast (DIC) images can be obtained simultaneously, which can then be used to retrieve the quantitative phase information of the sample under observation [2]. The miniaturized phase imaging system offers great potential for point-of-care phase imaging systems including microscopes and endoscopes.  \n\nRefractometric Microscopy:\n\nPreviously, a spectrometer was leveraged to monitor the resonance wavelength or the reflection intensity shift from a confined region and to sense analyte binding to the metasurfaces. More recently, the combination of high Q-factors supported by metasurfaces and imaging-based data acquisition has been studied to realize massively parallel sensing with high spatial and spectral resolution.\nAltug and colleagues have developed a spectrometer-free optofluidic biosensor based on dielectric metasurfaces utilizing single-wavelength imaging [3]. This method includes supporting a diatomic dielectric metasurface that provides a quasi-bound state in continuum (BIC) mode, allowing high-quality resonance with accessible near-fields through the destruction of in-plane symmetry. The large-area metasurface chip is configured as a microarray and integrated with microfluidics on the imaging platform for real-time detection of breast cancer extracellular vesicles containing exosomes [4]. In addition, the same research group developed a variety of detection methods for related biomarkers of inflammatory diseases. They reported a bright-field imaging plasmonic biosensor that allows visualization of single subwavelength gold nanoparticles (NPs) on large-area gold nanohole arrays (Au-NHAs). The sensor generates image heatmaps that reveal the locations of single NPs as high-contrast spikes, enabling the detection of individual NP-labeled molecules [5]. They implemented the method in a sandwich immunoassay for the detection of biotinylated bovine serum albumin (bBSA) and human C-reactive protein (CRP), a clinical biomarker of acute inflammatory disease. On this basis, they optimized and developed a portable biosensor based on nanoparticle-enhanced digital plasmonic imaging for rapid and sensitive detection of two sepsis-related inflammatory biomarkers from blood serum [6].   Apart from biomolecular detection and imaging, metasurface-based refractometric microscopy is also applied in the label-free observation of cell morphology. Photonic-crystal-enhanced microscopy (PCEM) has been demonstrated as a versatile platform for quantification and imaging of cell-surface interactions, such as stem-cell differentiation, invasion, chemotaxis, and apoptosis [7] [8] [9]"}, {"input": "In survey-based research, generating questions with different granularity is usually a heavy work.

However, the periodicity also allows for phase-matching of higher (evanescent) orders to localized leaky modes supported by the PC. Once excited, the leaky modes, defined by a complex propagation constant, possess a finite lifetime as they are diffracted in both the forward (transmitted) and backward (specular) directions. The backward re-radiated waves are in phase and constructively interfere with the zeroth backward-diffracted order, whereas the forward re-radiated waves are out of phase with the zeroth forward-diffracted order by \u03c0 radians31, causing destructive interference and consequently zero transmission. Thus, the external excitation of leaky modes is associated with a 100% reflection phenomenon for a resonant wavelength, assuming a defect-free, lossless system. As the excited leaky modes are localized in space during their finite lifetimes, they can be engineered to have very high energy density within regions of the PC at resonance. The magnitude of this energy density is directly related to the resonant mode lifetime or Q-factor of resonance, which in turn can be controlled by adjusting the device parameters. The intensity of emission of fluorescent species (which are absorptive at the resonant wavelengths) can be greatly enhanced by placing them in proximity to regions where the resonant modes concentrate most of their energy.\n\nThe existence of leaky modes overlapping the fluorescence emission spectrum opens up pathways for the emitted light to escape into free space. As well as direct emission, the fluorescence can now couple to the overlapping leaky modes and Bragg scatter out of the structure, thereby greatly reducing the amount of light trapped as guided modes compared with an unpatterned substrate. If the dispersion of these overlapping leaky modes is close to the \u0393-point band edge, that is, K\u2016 (magnitude of the in-plane wave vector) \u223c 0, most of the emitted light will be extracted within small angles to the surface normal. More generally, appropriately engineering the leaky dispersion of the PC facilitates the funnelling of guided light into regions of space where it can be easily detected. It can thus be appreciated that enhancement of fluorescence can be achieved in two steps: enhanced excitation and enhanced extraction.\n\n", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b41679169d47b5317016598f8876fc58a875590", "year": 2007, "authors": [{"authorId": "120344358", "name": "N.

The enhanced excitation mechanism enables substantial absorption of the pump energy for QDs within the vicinity of the PC surface and generates more photons than the same QDs in contact with an unpatterned glass surface. Second, the QD emission light couples with the PC fluorescent mode and radiates into the far-field at a higher extraction rate, so that more photons are captured during a single image integration time. Third, the dielectric PC produces a quantum efficiency enhancement through the Purcell effect, which results in reduced spontaneous emission lifetime and higher quantum efficiency. Fourth, the PC resonant modes provide a photonic dispersion that dictates the highly directional photon angular distribution in free space. The directional emission mechanism ensures greater photon collection efficiency from the PC, through strategic selection of a microscope objective whose NA incorporates the angles for a known QD emission wavelength.

Due to the near-field excitation boost and greater density of states, the spontaneous emission rate of QDs placed on the surface of the PC is also increased. This Purcell effect enhances QD emission by modifying quantum efficiency (QE) without increasing the non-radiative decay rate due to the lossless nature of dielectric materials. The improved emission rate corresponds to the lateral position of the QD on the PC surface and is consistent over a broad wavelength range for single emitters. In comparison to a solitary QD, the local density of available photon states is higher in the QD-PC-coupled system. An excited-state QD will transition to the ground state with a rapid radiative decay rate and emit photons.

Therefore, they have a great potential to serve as biomarkers in liquid biopsies. This review gives an overview of the current knowledge concerning ncRNAs and EVs as putative liquid biomarkers in urological tumor diseases. Areas covered: Literature was searched for ncRNAs including microRNA, long non-coding RNA, small interfering RNA, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA and PIWI-interacting RNA in blood (serum, plasma) and urine samples from urological tumor (urothelial, kidney, prostate, testicular germ cell, penile cancer) patients. Expert opinion: The data demonstrate an important potential of circulating non-coding RNAs as biomarkers in liquid biopsies for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with urological tumors.

However, newer methods of cDNA synthesis, specifically the use of miR-specific stem- loop primers, avoid the need for precedent fractionation and can distinguish between different miR forms (54). The miR-specific primers may also possess a linear segment in place of a stem- loop structure at their 5\u2032-end, although both of these variants contain an miR antisense portion of approximately 6\u20138 nucleotides on their 3\u2032-end. Independent of structure, the 5\u2032-end contains a common sequence for priming qPCR (9, 10, 50). Although the linear primers are easier to design, the stem-loop primers are better at specifically targeting the mature miR form, and thus provide enhanced specificity and reduced qPCR background. Although this is beneficial for getting more accurate quantitation of mature miR, it does hinder the RT of isomiR sequences (9). In both cases, RT primers should be designed such that annealing can be done at lower temperatures (usually 16\u25e6 C), as this helps preserve pri-/pre-miR secondary structures (thus keeping the template sequence sequestered) and thereby reduce RT of those longer, potentially unwanted miR forms (50). In contrast to using miR-specific primers, the second method uses a universal RT primer to synthesize cDNA. This is done in one of two ways. In the first, PAP is used to extend the miR population with a polyA tail. An RT primer containing a universal qPCR primer sequence followed by a polyT segment then binds to the extended miR for cDNA synthesis\u2014the number of thymine residues incorporated in the cDNA is selected for by aligning the RT primer to the 3\u2032-end of the miR using degenerate bases (usually three) that can base pair with more than one base. A downside to this method is that PAP extends all RNAs in the sample, including pri-/pre- miR sequences, and it does not allow for optimized primers for miR sets with widely varying Tms (50). In the second universal method, T4 ligase is used to ligate a common sequence to all miRs in the sample and then cDNA is synthesized with a universal RT primer. The use of these common sequence RT methods shifts the selection process for mature forms of miR to the qPCR step, which we discuss below. Another novel method of cDNA synthesis worth mentioning is the RT method used in miR-ID. In this method, miR in the sample is circularized through intermolecular ligation and reverse transcribed to produce tandem repeats of the cDNA sequence. This approach allows for great control over qPCR primer placement to distinguish between miR forms (55).", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/236d66cfa9b1e899400b3143f37db4eb3d2020d7", "year": 2015, "authors": [{"authorId": "10900258", "name": "Eric A.

Moreover, the resonance wavelength of such nanostructures is fixed by the size, shape, and material of the nano-resonators. Early approaches for exciting fluorescent reporters with dielectric optical microcavities demonstrate modest emission rate enhancements[3]. One limitation of dielectric microcavities is the mismatch between high-Q resonances of the cavity and the spectrally wide emission from inhomogeneously broadened fluorescent emitters at room temperature. Recent reports of electromagnetic field enhancement with plasmonic\u2013dielectric hybrid nano-gap and dielectric nanowire-slabs [4] addressed these issues and show ~ 1000\u00d7 enhancement, but with a small number of highly localized hot spots that sparsely occupy only a small fraction of the total surface area. Nevertheless, precise alignment between fluorescence emitters and cavity modes is required to achieve such high enhancement factors through sophisticated nanofabrication."}, {"input": "For research paper reading, how can we improve the automatic generation of related work sections for scientific papers with the help of language models?", "ctxs": [{"title": "Leaky-mode assisted fluorescence extraction: application to fluorescence enhancement biosensors.

A 60-fold increase in fluorescence intensity has been reported from a Cy-5-conjugated streptavidin layer on a 1-dimensional PC [0]. This enhancement can be improved to 360-fold by coupling the PC leaky mode to an underlying Fabry\u2013Perot-type cavity through a gold mirror reflector [1]. A 108\u00d7 fluorescence enhancement for a layer of QDs has been reported by using leaky-mode-assisted fluorescence extraction from a 2-dimensional PCs surface [2]. More recently, Yan et al. demonstrated a multiple heterostructure PC with a super-wide stopband to achieve broadband fluorescence enhancement of over 100-fold [3], which required complicated layer-by-layer fabrication of self-assembled 2D colloidal crystal monolayers. Three-dimensional PC structures have also been used to enhance fluorescence. Song et al. spin-coated a Ru dye layer on 3D opal PCs composed of multilayers of PMMA spheres to achieve ~320-fold luminescence enhancement with dual-stopband configurations [4]. Xiong et al. report a nearly 3000-fold signal enhancement achieved through multiplicative effects of enhanced excitation, highly directional extraction, quantum efficiency improvement, and blinking suppression through a photonic crystal surface. The approach achieves single quantum dot sensitivity with high signal-to-noise ratio, even when using a low-NA lens and an inexpensive optical setup. The blinking suppression capability of the PC improves the QDs on-time from 15% to 85% ameliorating signal intermittency. We developed an assay for cancer-associated miRNA biomarkers with single-molecule resolution, single-base mutation selectivity, and 10-attomolar detection limit. Additionally, we observed differential surface motion trajectories of QDs when their surface attachment stringency is altered by changing a single base in a cancer-specific miRNA sequence. [6]\n"}]
