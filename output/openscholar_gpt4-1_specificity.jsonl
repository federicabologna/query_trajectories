It is an important pest species due to its ability to transmit plant viruses and its ability to cause direct damage to plants through feeding. Mizus persicae has been used as a model organism in studies of aphid biology and ecology, and it is a popular species for use in biological control programs.\n\nMacrosiphum euphorbiae, also known as the potato aphid, is another important aphid species that can be used in biological control programs. It is a highly polyphagous species that can infest a wide range of crops, including potato, tobacco, and sweet pepper. Macrosiphum euphorbiae is known to be a vector of several plant viruses, and it can cause significant damage to plants through feeding. It is also an important species for use in biological control programs due to its ability to interact with other insects, such as predators and parasitoids.\n\nBoth Mizus persicae and Macrosiphum euphorbiae can be used in biological control programs that involve the use of predators or parasitoids to control aphid populations.

This aphid species is holocyclic, meaning it has a complete life cycle that includes both asexual and sexual stages. The asexual stage is parthenogenetic, and the sexual stage involves the production of eggs. Myzus persicae is a polyphagous aphid, feeding on a wide range of plant species, including wheat, oats, barley, and vegetables [7].\n\nBeneficial insects, such as predators and parasitoids, can be used to control Myzus persicae populations. For example, Aphidius matricariae (Haliday) is a parasitoid wasp that is commonly used for biological control of Myzus persicae [0]. This parasitoid wasp lays its eggs inside the aphid's body, and the larvae feed on the aphid's internal tissues, ultimately killing the aphid.\n\nAnother beneficial insect that can be used to control Myzus persicae is the lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Panzer) [2]. This lady beetle is a generalist predator that feeds on various aphid species, including Myzus persicae. The lady beetle can be released in the field to control aphid populations.\n\nAphidoletes aphidimyza (Riley) is another beneficial insect that can be used to control Myzus persicae [2][5]. This aphid midge is a generalist predator that feeds on various aphid species, including Myzus persicae. The aphid midge can be released in the field to control aphid populations.\n\nTo design an effective biological aphid control strategy, we need to consider the environmental conditions and the availability of beneficial insects. The strategy should involve the release of beneficial insects in the field, such as Aphidius matricariae, Harmonia axyridis, and Aphidoletes aphidimyza. The strategy should also involve the use of cultural practices, such as crop rotation and sanitation, to reduce the abundance of Myzus persicae populations [3].\n\nIn addition, the strategy should involve the use of integrated pest management (IPM) techniques, such as the use of biological control agents in combination with cultural practices and chemical control agents [3]. The strategy should also involve the monitoring of Myzus persicae populations and the beneficial insects to ensure the effectiveness of the control strategy.\n\nOverall, a biological aphid control strategy for Myzus persicae should involve the use of beneficial insects, cultural practices, and IPM techniques to reduce the abundance of Myzus persicae populations and minimize the use of chemical control agents [1].", "label": "3", "query_id": "query_6"}

Capex includes the costs of purchasing and installing equipment, such as base stations, towers, and antennas, as well as the costs of leasing or purchasing spectrum licenses. Opex, on the other hand, includes the ongoing costs of maintaining and operating the network, such as electricity bills, site and backhaul lease, and operation and maintenance costs.\n\nResearch has shown that the deployment cost of radiocommunication networks consists of both Capex and Opex. For radio access networks, the Capex mainly includes infrastructure costs, such as base station equipment, backhaul transmission equipment, site installation, and radio network controller equipment [3]. The key drivers for the Opex, on the other hand, are electricity bill, site and backhaul lease, and operation and maintenance cost [3].\n\nStudies have also investigated the cost savings that can be achieved through infrastructure sharing in emerging markets. For example, a study found that the most important items for CAPEX cost savings in emerging markets are civil and site acquisition and design, power, and BTS/NodeB [5]. In contrast, in developed markets, the most important cost item is civil and site acquisition costs, which amounts to 52% of the cost [5]. The access to electrical network is difficult and its coverage is weaker compared to developed countries, making power the main cost item in emerging countries [5].\n\nAnother study found that the most important items for OPEX cost savings in emerging markets are hardware and software support, power, land rent, and backhaul [6]. In developed countries, the land rent (site) represents 42% of the OPEX [6]. The study also found that the sharing of international connectivity, such as submarine cable cost, presents the most important part of the cost, accounting for more than 50% of the total OPEX costs [6].\n\nInfrastructure sharing has been shown to be an effective way to reduce both CAPEX and OPEX costs in emerging markets [1][2][5][6]. For example, a study found that the establishment of a rigorous integration and an operating plan implemented by a neutral party can provide a solid foundation for collaboration and allow a clear governance principles that dictates the decision-making processes for the efficient processing of CAPEX and OPEX [6]. A study also found that sharing equipment/segment can bring 50% of CAPEX/OPEX saving [6].\n\nIn addition, research has also investigated the impact of network sharing on the financial costs of launching satellite broadband mega-constellations. A study found that the total financial costs of each constellation do not account for the number of subscribers served, and thus the cost efficiency of each constellation per subscriber [4]. The study also found that Starlink has the highest aggregate cost, but also aims to service the largest number of users, leading to the lowest per subscriber cost [4].\n\nOverall, radiocommunication Capex and Opex are important factors to consider when deploying and operating wireless networks. Infrastructure sharing can be an effective way to reduce both CAPEX and OPEX costs, particularly in emerging markets [1][2][5][6].

The optimal deployment of radiocommunication systems requires careful consideration of various factors, including the location of base stations, the type of antennas used, and the layout of the network infrastructure.\n\nOne key consideration in radiocommunication deployment is the use of intelligent surfaces (IS) to enhance communication performance. IS can be strategically deployed to reduce the product-distance path-loss of the cascaded base station (BS)-IS-user channel, thereby improving signal strength and reducing interference [1]. The optimal deployment of IS can be achieved by integrating them along with active antennas of the BS/user terminal within the same antenna radome, or by deploying them in the environment separately from the BS/user terminal, but as close to the BS/user terminal as possible [1].\n\nAnother important aspect of radiocommunication deployment is the use of directional antennas. Directional antennas can be used to reduce interference and improve signal strength by focusing the signal towards the intended recipient [3]. The optimal deployment of directional antennas can be achieved by adopting a realistic angle-dependent directional antenna model for the UAVs and an ideal omni-directional antenna model for the ground users [3].\n\nIn addition, radiocommunication deployment also involves the use of small cells (SCs) and transport infrastructure. SCs can be deployed to provide coverage in areas with high traffic density, and can be connected to a transport infrastructure to provide backhaul connectivity [4]. The optimal deployment of SCs and transport infrastructure requires careful consideration of factors such as user distribution, capacity requirements, and interference mitigation techniques.\n\nFurthermore, radiocommunication deployment also involves the use of airborne relays to enhance communication between ground assets. Airborne relays can be deployed in locations that optimize communication performance, and can be used to identify the optimal altitude to deploy the air asset [5].\n\nFinally, radiocommunication deployment also involves the use of sharing and compatibility studies to ensure continued protection of incumbent services. For example, the World Radiocommunications Conference 2023 (WRC-23) discussed several agenda items related to possible new International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) identifications of several radio frequency bands, including the 10-10.5 GHz frequency band, which has a primary allocation to Radiolocation, Earth-Exploration Satellite services [6]. Sharing and compatibility studies were conducted to ensure continued protection of these incumbent services.\n\nIn conclusion, radiocommunication deployment is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various factors, including the location of base stations, the type of antennas used, the layout of the network infrastructure, and the use of sharing and compatibility studies to ensure continued protection of incumbent services.

This concept is crucial in understanding the limitations and strengths of various sequencing techniques and how they can be combined to achieve comprehensive coverage of the genome.\n\nIn the context of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS), LMRs are short regions with few CpG sites and more intermediate methylation levels, thought to be associated with transcription factor binding [7]. Complementary coverage of LMRs is essential for identifying these regions accurately and understanding their regulatory functions.\n\nStudies have shown that different sequencing methods can have varying levels of complementary coverage for LMRs [7]. For example, the SPLAT library preparation method has been shown to have a higher degree of overlap with high-coverage reference data sets for UMRs, but lower overlap for LMRs [7]. This suggests that SPLAT may be more effective for detecting UMRs, but may miss some LMRs that are present in high-coverage reference data sets.\n\nIn contrast, other methods, such as the Accel-NGS method, may have a higher degree of overlap for LMRs, but may not detect as many UMRs [7]. This highlights the importance of using complementary sequencing methods to achieve comprehensive coverage of the genome.\n\nMoreover, the degree of overlap between different sequencing methods can also be influenced by factors such as sequencing depth and coverage [7]. For example, regions with intermediate methylation levels may be more challenging to detect accurately, and may require higher sequencing depths to achieve comprehensive coverage.\n\nIn conclusion, complementary coverage of LMRs is a critical aspect of WGBS, and understanding the strengths and limitations of different sequencing methods is essential for achieving comprehensive coverage of the genome [7].

This is crucial for site planning of ITS infrastructure components, as it allows for the comparison of radio planning results and signal levels provided by the radio modules. Additionally, it is necessary to perform a calibration measurement to ensure that the radio modules' output corresponds to the RF level measurement values determined by RF measuring equipment [0].\n\nAnother important aspect of radiocommunication maintenance is the determination of the location of maximum exposure to electromagnetic fields associated with a radiocommunication station [3]. This can be done using an analytical expression that takes into account information of height, vertical half-power angle, and tilt of the antenna. The calculated point can be used as a reference location for surveyors to find the exact point of maximum exposure.\n\nFurthermore, radiocommunication maintenance also involves ensuring the electromagnetic compatibility of different services operating in the same frequency band [2][6]. This can be achieved through the use of Monte Carlo simulation methods and other techniques to determine the minimum coordination distance required between services [2]. Additionally, the use of side lobe suppression techniques and other measures can help to reduce interference between services [1].\n\nIn terms of specific radiocommunication systems, maintenance also involves ensuring the optimal functioning of systems such as the SeaSonde high-frequency ocean radars [7]. This can be achieved through the implementation of techniques such as directional transmit antennas, pulse-shaping, and band sharing capabilities, as well as the use of listen-before-talk modes and bandwidth adaptation [7].\n\nIn conclusion, radiocommunication maintenance is a critical aspect of ensuring the optimal functioning of radiocommunication systems, and involves a range of techniques and methodologies to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and minimize interference [1].\n\n", "label": "1", "query_id": "query_10"}

Starlink has a unique architecture, operating both its access and backbone networks, which enables it to provide global coverage [6].\n\nStarlink's ground stations are connected to regional or country-wide points of presence (PoPs), which are connected to a global network of PoPs [0]. PoPs are used to interconnect Starlink's satellite network with other ISPs and CDNs. For example, Starlink is connected to major upstream providers all around the globe, such as Level3 (AS3356) [3]. Starlink's PoPs are not only used for interconnection but also to serve as a gateway between the satellite network and the terrestrial internet [2]. The setup of PoPs follows local regulatory requirements and has different ranges of ground station coverage [6].\n\nIn terms of regional interconnection, Starlink's latency varies across different regions. For example, Starlink's latency is slightly higher (10%) than that of the terrestrial network on average and is much more unstable [5]. Obstruction, satellite movements, and ISP routing decisions are potential factors that affect Starlink's latency [5]. However, Starlink's latency has been improving over time, with a trend towards more consistent sub-50 ms latencies globally over the past 17 months [7].\n\nStarlink's latency performance also varies depending on the location of the user. For example, users in Europe experience longer latencies compared to users in the US, with a 75th percentile of around 20 ms longer [7]. In contrast, users in South America and Oceania experience longer tail latencies, often surpassing 100 ms [7]. However, the deployment of local PoPs can significantly improve latency performance, as seen in the Philippines [7].

This overlap can be caused by the use of VHF signals in different contexts, such as UAVs flying in the air and transmitting radio communications, or drone base stations (DBSs) at different altitudes with different coverage radii [2][7].\n\nFor example, the MIS-TRAL project aims to develop a network of UAVs that will fly in the air and retransmit radio communications between ground personnel, taking advantage of the line-of-sight (LoS) channel conditions [1]. However, the overlap of VHF signals from different UAVs can cause interference and reduce the quality of the communication.\n\nSimilarly, in drone cellular networks, the coverage overlapping problem occurs when multiple DBSs are deployed at different altitudes with different corresponding coverage radii [2][7]. This can cause co-channel interference, which can reduce the system sum rate and increase the computation time [2].\n\nIn the context of TV broadcast and wireless systems for public safety networks in TV white space, the overlap of VHF signals from TV systems and wireless systems can cause interference and reduce the service coverage [5][6]. The minimum separation distances and power levels of the systems can be adjusted to mitigate this overlap, but the optimal values depend on the specific implementation and the desired level of interference [5][6].\n\nTo address these issues, various solutions have been proposed, including the use of data-driven algorithms to optimize the placement of DBSs in drone cellular networks [2][7], and the use of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to evaluate the performance of VHF signals in different scenarios [4].

Centralized RAN (C-RAN) and cloud RAN (Cloud RAN) are two prominent architectures that have gained significant attention in recent years.\n\nC-RAN, also known as cloud radio access network, is a centralized architecture where baseband processing is concentrated at a central location, connected to remote radio heads (RRHs) through high-capacity, low-latency fronthaul links [1][4]. This approach enables flexible resource allocation, load balancing, and coordination among RUs, leading to improved spectral efficiency, reduced interference, and simplified network upgrades [1][4]. Cloud RAN further extends this concept by leveraging cloud computing and virtualization technologies to provide a more flexible and agile network infrastructure [5].\n\nIn a C-RAN, the central unit (CU) performs baseband processing, while the remote radio heads (RRHs) handle radio functions, such as transmission and reception [1]. This separation allows for the efficient use of resources, as the CU can be provisioned with additional resources as needed, while the RRHs can be designed to be low-cost and energy-efficient [1]. Furthermore, C-RAN enables the implementation of coordinated and cooperative transmission/reception strategies, such as enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC) and Coordinated Multi-Point transmission (CoMP) in LTE-A, across the RUs connected to the same CU [1].\n\nHowever, C-RAN faces challenges in designing fronthaul links with sufficient capacity and minimal latency [4]. Two options are available: fiber fronthaul and wireless fronthaul [4]. Fiber fronthaul guarantees high capacity and minimal latency but can be cost-prohibitive due to high trenching expenses [4]. Wireless fronthaul provides cost efficiency and allows for rapid, flexible, and scalable deployment, especially in areas where fiber connectivity is impractical or unavailable [4].\n\nCentralization gains in C-RAN can be classified into multiplexing gains and coordination gains [6]. Multiplexing gains depend on the statistical properties of aggregated traffic and processing demand at the CU, while coordination gains are due to coordinated radio resource management and control for a cluster of RUs [6]. Coordination gains include scheduling, inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC), cell-based discontinuous transmission (DTX), and other techniques where the CU decides on the allocation and transmission of resources on a per-frame basis [6].\n\nIn summary, the centralization of radiocommunications in C-RAN and Cloud RAN architectures offers several advantages, including improved network efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced user experience [1][5].

In low-heterogeneity settings, merging may outperform ensembling [0]. However, as heterogeneity increases, there exists a transition point beyond which ensembling outperforms merging [0]. For example, when all predictors have random effects, the covariance of the least squares ensemble estimator for the coefficients is generally smaller than that of the merged least squares estimator [2]. However, since the merged learner is trained on a larger sample, the trace of its second component is generally smaller than that of the ensemble learner [2].\n\nIn practice, the choice between merging and ensembling depends on the specific use case and the characteristics of the data. For example, in the context of microbiome data, a study found that merging outperformed ensembling for lasso and random forest, while ensembling outperformed merging for least squares and ridge regression [0].\n\nEnsemble learning algorithms, such as stacking, blending, bagging, and boosting, are widely used approaches to combine multiple predictors to a meta-learner, which consistently outperforms individual predictors [5]. These ensemble approaches can be further divided into supervised and unsupervised methods. In the supervised ensemble learning realm, the techniques are primarily centered around the ranking and combination of different predictors using ground truth information [5]. For example, stacking and blending techniques operate by aggregating predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms, all trained on the same dataset [5]. Predictions generated by various algorithms are treated as new features and feed into a supervised learning model to predict the final ensembled scores [5].\n\nIn contrast, model fusion approaches, such as the one proposed in [6], involve the explicit merging of multiple models into a new one, which can be done through weighted averaging or majority voting [6]. This approach can be used when the original training datasets are distributed and protected, and it does not require the access to the entire training dataset [5].\n\nIn addition, knowledge fusion of large language models has been explored in recent works [6][7]. For example, FUSELLM presents a new paradigm for knowledge fusion of multiple LLMs, which leverages the probabilities distribution matrices generated from source LLMs to transfer the collective knowledge and respective advantages into a target LLM [7]. This approach supports the fusion of multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM.\n\nIn summary, the choice between merging and ensembling depends on the specific use case and the characteristics of the data. Ensemble learning algorithms and model fusion approaches can be used to combine multiple regression predictions to improve overall performance, but the most appropriate approach depends on the context and the characteristics of the data [5].", "label": "2", "query_id": "query_34"}

Several methods have been proposed to detect OOD samples, which can be broadly categorized into classification-based methods, density-based methods, distance-based methods, and reconstruction-based methods [3].\n\nClassification-based methods include output-based techniques and outlier exposure. For instance, ODIN uses temperature scaling and input perturbations to improve the separation between in-distribution and OOD samples, while LogitNorm enforces a constant vector norm on logits during training to produce more reliable confidence scores [3]. Outlier Exposure (OE) utilizes external OOD datasets during training to enhance detection capabilities [3].\n\nDensity-based methods explicitly model the density of in-distribution data, flagging low-density regions as OOD. An example is the use of class-conditional Gaussian distributions, which identify OOD samples based on their likelihoods within the modeled distribution [3].\n\nDistance-based methods calculate the distance between test samples and class prototypes or centroids in the feature space. Some examples include Mahalanobis distance-based OOD detection and KNN-based methods, which use nearest neighbor distances without assuming any specific distribution for the feature space [3].\n\nReconstruction-based methods rely on autoencoders or similar techniques to detect OOD samples by analyzing reconstruction errors, such as autoencoder-based methods and MoodCat [3].\n\nIn addition to these methods, other approaches have been proposed to detect OOD samples. For example, the Out-Of-Distribution detection task can be conceptualized as a task of distinguishing between two classes during inference, i.e., the objective of OOD detection is to determine whether a sample x \u2208 X originates from P id or not [1]. This task can be addressed by integrating a novelty detection mechanism during deployment that detects samples deviating from the known distribution [1].\n\nEnergy Correction Model in the Feature Space for Out-of-Distribution Detection proposes to use the learned energy as an uncertainty score to detect out-of-distribution samples [5]. Given an input sample x *, we compute its feature representation z * = \u03d5(x * ) and the decision function for out-of-distribution detection is given by G(z * ) = 1{E \u03b8 (z * ) + E MoG (z * ) \u2265 \u03b3}, where \u03b3 is a threshold which can be chosen so that at least 95 % of the in-distribution examples are correctly classified [5].\n\nHyperbolic Metric Learning for Visual Outlier Detection also proposes to use the level set estimation to detect out-of-distribution samples [1]. The decision can be made employing level set estimation: G \u03bb (x) = 1 {S(x) \u2265 \u03bb}, where samples with higher scores S(x) are classified as ID, and vice versa [1].\n\nIt's worth noting that some methods can be combined to improve the detection of out-of-distribution samples. For example, Hyperparameter-Free Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Softmax of Scaled Cosine Similarity proposes a hyperparameter-free method based on softmax of scaled cosine similarity, which can be used in combination with other methods to improve detection performance [7].\n\nIn conclusion, detecting out-of-distribution samples is a challenging task that requires the use of various methods and techniques. By combining different approaches, it is possible to improve the detection of OOD samples and enhance the reliability of deep neural networks in real-world applications [1][2][3][4][5][6][7].\n\n", "label": "1", "query_id": "query_35"}

This concept is crucial in understanding the limitations and capabilities of machine learning models. Research in learning complexity has led to the development of various complexity measures and risk bounds, which help in evaluating the performance of learning algorithms.\n\nOne of the primary goals of learning theory is to understand how the sample complexity of learning depends on the complexity of the model [4]. The Rademacher complexity is a classical result that determines the rate of convergence of uniform laws of large numbers over a function class [4]. Sharp upper and lower bounds on sample complexity have been established via Rademacher complexity and its localized versions [4]. Other complexity measures, such as VC dimension, Fat-shattering dimension, and empirical and distribution-dependent covering numbers, have also been investigated in the literature [7].\n\nThe relationship between computational and statistical complexity is another area of research in learning theory [6]. For example, algorithms based on polynomial regression can guarantee efficient learning while using data that is a polynomial factor larger than the statistical complexity [6]. In some cases, efficient learning may require data that is at least a polynomial factor larger than the statistical complexity under some plausible complexity theoretic assumptions [6].\n\nMoreover, learning complexity is closely related to the trade-offs between different learning objectives, such as accuracy, computational efficiency, and sample complexity [6]. For instance, some learning algorithms may achieve optimal performance in terms of accuracy but require a large amount of data or computational resources [6]. In contrast, other algorithms may achieve faster convergence rates or require less data but may not achieve the same level of accuracy [6].\n\nTo address the challenges of learning complexity, researchers have proposed various techniques, such as sample compression [6], which can reduce the amount of data required for learning by identifying the most informative samples. Other approaches include the use of complexity-based regularization methods, such as L1 and L2 regularization, which can help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of learning models [6].\n\nIn addition, the study of learning complexity has led to the development of new learning algorithms and techniques, such as agnostic learning [6], which can learn from noisy or incomplete data. These algorithms can be used to address complex tasks, such as learning from high-dimensional data or learning from data with missing values [6].\n\nOverall, learning complexity is a fundamental concept in machine learning that has far-reaching implications for the development of efficient and effective learning algorithms [6]. Understanding the complexities of learning can help researchers to design better learning models and algorithms, leading to improved performance in a wide range of applications [6].\n\n", "label": "1", "query_id": "query_36"}

However, some papers have challenged certain aspects of the UD project, particularly with regards to its universality and applicability to all languages.\n\nOne challenge to the UD project is the status of function words in dependency grammar, which is a topic of debate among linguists [7]. The UD project's annotation scheme is based on an evolution of Stanford dependencies, Google universal part-of-speech tags, and the Interset interlingua for morphosyntactic tagsets, but some researchers argue that this scheme is not universally applicable and may not be suitable for all languages [7]. For example, the UD project's reliance on a fixed set of universal part-of-speech tags may not be sufficient to capture the nuances of languages with complex grammatical systems.\n\nAnother challenge to the UD project is the issue of language-specific extensions, which are allowed in the UD annotation scheme but may not always be necessary or desirable [7]. Some researchers argue that the UD project's emphasis on universality may lead to oversimplification of language-specific features, which can result in poor performance on certain languages or tasks.\n\nFurthermore, some papers have highlighted the limitations of the UD project in terms of its coverage of multilingual data. While the UD project provides over 240 treebanks in 140+ languages, there is still a gap in 'within-language breadth' -namely, a lack of diversity within high-resource languages and their closely related nonstandard languages and dialects [4]. For example, the UD project lacks a treebank for Bavarian, a German language variety spoken by over 10 million people [4].\n\nDespite these challenges, the UD project remains a valuable resource for multilingual NLP research, and many papers have built upon its foundation to develop new models and techniques for multilingual syntax-aware language modeling [0][5]. For example, the MaiBaam project has developed a UD treebank for Bavarian, which provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in this language variety [4].\n\nIn summary, while the UD project has faced challenges and limitations, it remains a crucial resource for multilingual NLP research, and many papers have built upon its foundation to develop new models and techniques for multilingual syntax-aware language modeling [0][5].\n\n", "label": "2", "query_id": "query_40"}

The goal of dependency parsing is to analyze the grammatical structure of a sentence by establishing dependency relations between words [1]. In the context of QA, dependency parsing can be used to identify the relationships between the different chunks in a question, which can help improve the quality of generated questions and answer retrieval.\n\nSeveral studies have explored the use of dependency parsing for QA. For example, Abujabal et al. [2] used dependency parsing to analyze the composition of utterances and aligned it with the logic form. They found that dependency parsing can be effective in coping with compositional utterances and identifying important tokens contained by parsed dependency paths. Similarly, Kapanipathi et al. [1] introduced Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to help understand questions, which can be effective in disambiguating natural language utterances and understanding questions in a knowledge base-independent way.\n\nDependency parsing can also be used to generate natural questions from cloze questions. For instance, Sun et al. [3] used a dependency reconstruction approach to generate natural questions. They applied dependency parsing to the cloze questions and translated them to natural questions by moving answer-related words to the front of the question and pruning left child nodes. This approach can help improve the quality of generated questions by incorporating structure property of questions.\n\nIn addition, dependency parsing can be used to identify the relevant target concepts and question words for question generation. For example, Luo et al. [2] used named entity recognition (NER), dependency parsing techniques, and adverb and noun subtype analysis to identify the relevant target concepts and question words. This approach can help enhance the quality of generated questions by addressing key limitations in existing systems.\n\nMoreover, dependency parsing can be used to improve the accuracy of question answering over knowledge graphs. For instance, Sun et al. [6] proposed a novel method called the Chunked Learning Network, which uses different models according to different scenarios to obtain a vector representation of the topic entity and relation in the question. They used dependency parsing to construct dependency relationships between words to obtain more accurate vector representations, which can help improve the accuracy of question answering.\n\nIn conclusion, dependency parsing is an essential component in question answering, particularly for complex questions.

One approach involves using an optimization-simulation model to determine the optimal gate control operations [0]. This model combines genetic algorithms with simulation software for short-term rainfall forecasting, rainfall-runoff modeling, and 1D and 2D combined unsteady flow models. The model can be used to manage reservoir release schedules (optimal gate operations) before, during, and after a rainfall event, controlling downstream water surface elevations to avoid exceedance of threshold flood levels at target locations throughout a river-reservoir system.\n\nAnother approach uses numerical model simulations to assess the potential contributions of proposed flood control gates to the flood control capacity of a basin [1][5]. For example, the Huangpu Gate, proposed for the Lake Taihu basin in China, can help to reduce both peak values and duration of high water levels in Lake Taihu, benefiting surrounding areas along the Taipu Canal and the Huangpu River [1][5]. The contribution of the gate to the flood control capacity is closely associated with its operation modes and duration.\n\nHydrodynamic simulation supported with GIS tools can also be used to analyze the potential influence of a river on surrounding areas [3]. This approach can help to determine flood hazard maps and longitudinal profiles of the water surface, and identify the most effective ways to control flood wave propagation and reconstruct seasonal inundation.\n\nIn addition, the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to develop remotely monitored autonomous floodgates for water management and control [4][7]. This approach can provide a complete function for the user, including quick data update, full picture of IoT clients, and interactive command buttons, allowing for centralized monitoring of multiple gates and automated control of water gate opening and closure.\n\nFurthermore, the use of weirs and navigational dams can be effective in controlling flood wave propagation and reconstructing seasonal inundation [3]. The inline structures can be controlled by the arrival of the flood wave, reducing the culmination of the flood wave, forcing the flood in the selected place, and reducing the total flood risk coverage.\n\nOverall, these methods can be used to prevent inland flooding during heavy rain by controlling the opening and closing of floodgates in the river network [0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7].", "label": "2", "query_id": "query_48"}

For instance, a study by Tixier et al. demonstrated analyzing unstructured incident reports utilizing an NLP model, yielding significant results with F1 score values of 0.96 [5]. Similarly, Zhang et al. employed text mining and NLP methods to investigate construction accident reports, utilizing various machine learning models, with the optimized ensemble model showcasing the highest F1 score of 0.68 [5].\n\nAnother approach is the use of generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) to predict construction accident outcomes [2][7].

The introduction of a saliency visualization method enhances the interpretability of the model's decision-making process, providing a solution to the black-box nature of GPT models [2]. By systematically assessing the impact of individual words on prediction outcomes, the method offers unique insights into the decision-making process of the model, contributing to building trust in the model's predictions [2].\n\nFurthermore, generative AI tools can be integrated with BIM (Building Information Modeling) technologies to provide a more comprehensive approach to occupational hazard risk assessment [3]. BIM design and rules algorithms can be used to automatically check construction models and schedules for safety risks, while BIM 4D can be used for occupational risk prevention in the design and planning phases [3]. The use of BIM 3D models and 4D construction scheduling simulation can provide a detailed, deep, and clear understanding of site conditions and all the construction phases, enabling designers and contractors to identify hazards and design and schedule errors [3].\n\nGenerative AI tools specifically designed for occupational hazard risk assessment on construction sites can also be used to automate repetitive, time-intensive construction tasks, such as generating coherent schedules that logically sequence activities and meet scope requirements [4].

The Karman sensors can detect when the front barrier should start to rise and when the lower hinged lintel should start to be lowered. The system can also be designed to automatically divert the flow of water towards the center of the street, creating a dry area near the entrance door to the house.\n\nIn addition, a coastal reservoir strategy can be employed to prevent inland flooding during heavy rain [5]. This involves building a barrage across a channel to keep out sea water and releasing excess stormwater into the sea when the tide is low. The barrage can also be used to control floodwater during heavy rain, and the system can be designed to pump out excess water into the sea when it is not possible to release it during high tide.\n\nFurthermore, sensor technology can be used to estimate reservoir inflow and dynamically control reservoir gates to prevent flooding [7]. By integrating data from rainfall and soil moisture sensors, coupled with potential inputs from upstream reservoirs, the system can trigger the activation of a servo motor to simulate the opening and closing of reservoir gates. This automated approach can provide a cost-effective and efficient solution for flood prevention and address the challenges posed by uncontrolled urbanization and legal constraints.\n\nOverall, these methods can be used to control the opening and closing of floodgates to prevent inland flooding during heavy rain, and can be designed to work in conjunction with each other to provide a comprehensive flood control system [0].", "label": "2", "query_id": "query_50"}

This approach can help authorities to take preventive actions to deal with flood disaster.\n\nAnother method is to use a whole region perspective approach, which considers the flood bearing capacity of the mainstream river and tributaries to control floods [6]. This approach can help to reduce flooding pressure in the small-scale river basin by transferring floodwater into the downstream of the mainstream river with abundant flood-carrying capacity.\n\nAdditionally, predictive real-time control optimization can be used to optimize the opening and closing of floodgates [7]. By analyzing historical data and weather forecasts, the system can predict the likelihood of flooding and adjust the opening and closing of floodgates accordingly. This approach can help to minimize the risk of inland flooding during heavy rain.\n\nIt's worth noting that the effectiveness of these methods depends on various factors, including the topography of the area, the size and capacity of the floodgates, and the severity of the rain event.

In this study, 15 morphological traits were assessed in an F1 genetic segregation population containing 160 progenies. The results showed substantial levels of genetic variation and widespread positive correlation among the traits. Using the inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) method, 59 QTLs related to 15 key morphological traits were successfully identified, which explained phenotypic variance (PVE) ranging from 6.21% to 17.74%. These findings offer valuable insights into the genetic basis of quantitative traits and are beneficial for molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) in anthurium breeding.\n\nIn another study, the genetic segregation patterns of ornamental traits in interspecific hybrids of ornamental pepper were evaluated [1]. The results showed that there was variability among the parents and interspecific hybrids for the evaluated traits. The parents and interspecific hybrids were clustered in four groups, which demonstrated that there was variability among them for the evaluated traits. These findings are important for the genetic improvement of ornamental pepper.\n\nFurthermore, studies have shown that the genetic segregation patterns of ornamental traits can be influenced by the inheritance patterns of key ornamental traits [2]. For example, in a study on the inheritance patterns of primary ornamental traits in the F1 hybrid progeny of LSB' and GMZ', it was found that the main ornamental traits of the hybrid progeny varied greatly. The segregation ratios of single and double flowers and ligulate and split ray florets were both 1:1.

By analyzing the genetic patterns of important ornamental traits, researchers can provide a theoretical basis and practical tools for genetic breeding. For example, in a study on the morphological variability of Eustoma hybrids obtained from interspecific crosses between Eustoma grandiflorum \u00d7 Eustoma exaltatum, it was found that the hybrids formed four groups, which showed independence with the other hybrids [5]. The distribution related to ornamental traits for cut-flower was observed in the UPGMA dendrogram obtained from morphologic data. The group B integrated in its most by hybrids with higher PL, and higher values in FN and NN. The flower color trait did not influence in grouping, which suggests that this morphologic trait is not apt for grouping of Eustoma genus.\n\nIn conclusion, the genetic segregation patterns of ornamental traits in hybrid progenies play a crucial role in the genetic improvement of ornamental plants [4].

Soy protein is also known for its ability to be digested more rapidly and directed towards deamination pathways and liver protein synthesis [3].\n\nPea protein has a high digestibility rate, with a true ileal amino acid digestibility of around 90-100% [4]. It is also known for its allergen-free properties and easy digestibility [1].\n\nRice protein has a lower digestibility rate compared to dairy proteins, with a true ileal amino acid digestibility of around 80-90% [1]. However, it is still considered a high-quality protein source due to its high content of essential amino acids [6].\n\nHemp protein has a high digestibility rate, with a true ileal amino acid digestibility of around 80-90% [1]. It is also known for its ability to provide omega fatty acids and dietary fiber [1].\n\nEgg protein has an excellent amino acid profile and is considered a high-quality protein source [1]. It has a high digestibility rate, with a true ileal amino acid digestibility of around 90-100% [1].\n\nBeef protein has a high digestibility rate, with a true ileal amino acid digestibility of around 90-100% [1]. It is also known for its ability to provide a high amount of essential amino acids, particularly leucine [6].\n\nIn conclusion, the digestibility and absorption of various proteins can vary significantly depending on their source and composition. Whey protein and casein protein have different absorption rates, with whey protein being absorbed more rapidly [2]. Soy protein has a lower digestibility rate compared to dairy proteins, but it is still considered a high-quality protein source [4]. Pea protein, rice protein, hemp protein, egg protein, and beef protein have varying digestibility rates, but they are all considered high-quality protein sources [1].", "label": "2", "query_id": "query_60"}

These studies have investigated the effects of different protein sources on postprandial amino acid availability, nitrogen balance, and muscle protein metabolism.\n\nOne study compared the amino acid availability of a dairy and vegetable protein blend (P4 protein) with single casein, whey, soy, and pea proteins [3]. The results showed that P4 protein had a higher amino acid availability than the individual proteins, particularly for leucine and methionine. Another study evaluated the digestibility and absorption of pea protein in old rats and found that it had a similar effect on nitrogen balance, true digestibility, and net protein utilization as casein and whey protein [5].\n\nA review article on the anabolic properties of plant- vs. animal-based protein sources discussed the effects of different protein sources on muscle mass maintenance [1]. The review highlighted the importance of protein quality, including amino acid composition and digestibility, in determining the anabolic potential of a protein source. Another review article evaluated the nutritional potential and functionality of hemp and rapeseed proteins, including their anti-nutritional factors, bioactive compounds, and functional attributes [2].\n\nA double-blind, cross-over trial compared the amino acid availability of a dairy and vegetable protein blend with single casein, whey, soy, and pea proteins [3].

Autophagy is a complex process that plays a vital role in recycling and re-utilizing nutrients and adapting to stress [2]. The ATG3 gene is involved in the response to multiple abiotic stresses, including salinity, drought, and low-nitrogen stress [2][3]. Overexpression of the ATG3 gene has been shown to improve tolerance to these stresses in various plant species, including maize [2][3], Arabidopsis [2][3], and tea [6].\n\nIn maize, the overexpression of the ATG3 gene has been found to increase the expression of other ATGs, such as ATG3, ATG5, and ATG8b, under stress conditions [4]. This suggests that ATG3 plays a role in regulating the autophagy pathway and improving stress tolerance in plants.\n\nIn addition to its role in stress tolerance, the ATG3 gene has also been found to be involved in the regulation of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation [6]. For example, overexpression of the ATG3 gene has been shown to improve tolerance to nitrogen starvation in tea plants [6].\n\nOverall, the ATG3 gene is an important component of the autophagy pathway in plants, and its overexpression has been found to improve tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses, including salinity, drought, and low-nitrogen stress [2][3].\n\nRecent studies have also highlighted the importance of ATG3 in regulating autophagy in response to abiotic stresses.

Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway that is crucial to plant survival in environmental stress conditions, including salt stress [1]. ATG genes are involved in various physiological processes crucial for salt adaptation, including stomatal regulation, photosynthetic efficiency, osmotic adjustment, Na+ sequestration, antioxidant defense, and metabolic activities [1]. Recent studies have identified ATG genes in various plant species, including Arabidopsis, wheat, and rice, and have shown that these genes are up-regulated in response to salt stress [0][2][3]. For example, overexpression of ATG8 in Arabidopsis has been shown to improve salt stress tolerance [0]. In addition, ATG genes have been shown to interact with phytohormone signaling pathways, such as abscisic acid and salicylic acid, to regulate plant responses to salt stress [1]. Furthermore, ATG genes have been found to be involved in the regulation of antioxidant systems, including superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase, to reduce oxidative stress caused by salt stress [5]. Overall, the research suggests that ATG genes play a critical role in plant salt stress tolerance and that understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying their role may offer valuable insights for the design of innovative strategies to improve crop productivity and ensure global food security in the face of the globally increasing severity of soil salinization [1].", "label": "3", "query_id": "query_63"}

It has a single serotype with six genotypes, which are based on examining a 168-nucleotide fragment of the VP1-2A region [2]. Genotypes I, II, and III circulate among humans, whereas genotypes IV, V, and VI infect simians [4]. The viral genome consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded linear RNA, with 60 copies each of its three major structural proteins, namely, VP1, VP2, and VP3 [0]. The virus is a non-enveloped, 27-to 28-nm spherical virus with icosahedral symmetry [0].\n\nThe HAV strains can be classified into different genotypes and subtypes, which tend to show different geographic distributions [2]. For example, in South Africa, the strains detected in wastewater samples were found to be 90.3-95.6% identical to the HM175 strain at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively [3]. They formed a unique cluster within genotype IB, which also included strains from clinical sources collected in Gauteng [3]. In contrast, strains from Kenya and Tanzania did not cluster within this group [3].\n\nThe classification of HAV can be useful for epidemiologic studies, as it can help identify the source of outbreaks and track the spread of the virus [0]. For example, a study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil found that the viral strain distribution identified in the city was linked to imported strains from Europe and Asia [6]. The study found that the majority of the sequences clustered in epidemic clades, which were similar to those found in European and Asian outbreaks [6].\n\nOverall, the classification of HAV is important for understanding the epidemiology of the virus and for developing effective control measures [7].\n\n", "label": "2", "query_id": "query_67"}
