The objective of this study was to analyze survival rates at very specific residual disease diameters to determine the optimal goal of primary cytoreduction for bulky stage IIIC EOC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospectively kept database was used to identify and review the records of all pts with Stage IIIC EOC who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery at our institution between January 1989 and December 2003. To analyze a homogeneous cohort of cases, we excluded pts with stage IIIC disease based on nodal metastasis alone (without bulky abdominal tumor), fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinomas, and borderline tumors. Standard statistical analyses were utilized.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study cohort included 465 pts. The median age was 60 years (range, 25-87), and the median follow-up was 38 months (range, 1-199). Univariate and multivariate analyses, which included various prognostic factors, identified amount of residual disease as a significant prognostic factor (P < 0.001). Median overall survival in relation to the 5 residual disease categories was: no gross residual, 106 months; gross < or =0.5 cm, 66 months; 0.6-1.0 cm, 48 months; 1-2 cm, 33 months; >2 cm, 34 months. Statistical comparison between the 5 residual disease categories revealed 3 distinct groups with significantly different survival rates (P < 0.01). These 3 groups were: (1) no gross residual; (2) gross < or =1 cm residual; and (3) >1 cm residual. Although the difference in survival did not reach statistical significance, within the gross < or =1 cm residual group, there was a trend toward improved survival in pts left with smaller volume, < or =0.5 cm residual compared with those with 0.6-1.0 cm residual (P = 0.06).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur data suggest that removal of all evidence of macroscopic disease is associated with prolonged survival and should be the goal of primary cytoreductive surgery. If complete gross resection is not feasible, however, cytoreduction to as minimal residual tumor as possible should be the focus of cytoreductive efforts, as each incremental decrease in residual disease below 1 cm may be associated with an incremental improvement in overall survival."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Sagae et al., 2023)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 258080438, "title": "Improvement in radiation techniques for locally advanced cervical cancer during the last two decades", "year": 2023, "venue": "International Journal of Gynecological Cancer", "authors": [{"name": "S.

The primary end point was locoregional recurrence 3 years after the index surgery. Secondary end points included disease-free and overall survival.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 1044 patients were included (699 in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 345 in the open-surgery group). At 3 years, the locoregional recurrence rate was 5.0% in the two groups (difference, 0 percentage points; 90% confidence interval [CI], -2.6 to 2.6).

NC was either doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) alone or AC followed by neoadjuvant/adjuvant docetaxel. Lumpectomy patients received breast radiotherapy alone; mastectomy patients received no radiotherapy. Pathologic complete response was defined as the absence of invasive tumor in the breast. Multivariate analyses were used to identify independent predictors of LRR. The primary end point was time to LRR as first event.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn 3,088 patients, 335 LRR events had occurred after 10 years of follow-up. The 10-year cumulative incidence of LRR was 12.3% for mastectomy patients (8.9% local; 3.4% regional) and 10.3% for lumpectomy plus breast radiotherapy patients (8.1% local; 2.2% regional). Independent predictors of LRR in lumpectomy patients were age, clinical nodal status (before NC), and pathologic nodal status/breast tumor response; in mastectomy patients, they were clinical tumor size (before NC), clinical nodal status (before NC), and pathologic nodal status/breast tumor response. By using these independent predictors, groups at low, intermediate, and high risk of LRR could be identified.

Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast (ypT0/is), pCR breast/axilla (ypT0/isN0), treatment delivery, and toxicities were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses, dose modification, or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity. Grade \u2265 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin, as were hypertension, infection, thromboembolic events, bleeding, and postoperative complications with bevacizumab. Employing one-sided P values, addition of either carboplatin (60% v 44%; P = .0018) or bevacizumab (59% v 48%; P = .0089) significantly increased pCR breast, whereas only carboplatin (54% v 41%; P = .0029) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla. More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn stage II to III TNBC, addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates, but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown.

Only patients with potentially resectable tumors were included. CRM status was defined as clear or involved (microscopic tumor within 1 mm of the resection margin). Statistical analysis was done by means of univariate and multivariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. One hundred ten patients were analyzed.

Tumor size and LN status were significant determinants of survival following R0 resection. There were no differences in survival based on tumor size and LN in patients with R1 resection.

Methods Between December 2012 and March 2017, 12 consecutive patients underwent percutaneous US-guided laser ablation as radical treatment of primary inoperable unifocal BC. Results At median follow-up of 28.5 months (range 6-51), no residual disease or progression occurred; the overall success rate for complete tumor ablation was therefore 100%. No significant operative side effects were observed, with only 2 (13.3%) experiencing slight to mild pain during the procedure, and all patients complained of a mild dull aching pain in the first week after procedure.

Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the institutional review board and was the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant. The prospective study was performed on seven 3DMB proven low risk prostate cancer patients. In the first phase of the procedure the patient's prostate was aligned to a position concordant with prior 3DMB using the transperineal grid and fiduciary golden marker coordinates. In the second phase ablation was performed using MR thermometry to determine the ablation endpoint and lesion coverage. Immediately after treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging was done. Prostate-specific antigen testing was performed 3 and 12 months after the treatment and compared by ANOVA test. A follow up biopsy was done one year following ablation. Results: The entire procedure took less than 2 hours and all patients tolerated the procedure well. There was a significant difference in prostate-specific antigen value before and 3 months after the treatment (p = 0.005). Four out of 6 patients had positive follow up biopsy for cancer.
