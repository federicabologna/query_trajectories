In contrast, non-cleavable linkers maintain the connection between antibody and payload until the entire complex is internalized and degraded within lysosomes, significantly reducing the risk of systemic payload exposure <Paper corpusId=\"268574267\" paperTitle=\"(Shih et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis difference in systemic toxicity has been demonstrated in controlled experimental settings. In target-independent safety studies in rats, non-cleavable linker ADCs showed markedly reduced toxicity compared to cleavable linker counterparts, directly attributed to decreased release of free drug into circulation <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. Specifically, while ADCs with cleavable linkers lost their drug payload more quickly in circulation, non-cleavable linker conjugates maintained payload attachment with kinetics similar to the total antibody, resulting in less systemic exposure to free cytotoxic agents <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe stability of the linker has been shown to significantly influence the ADC's toxicity profile, with the most stable linkers releasing the chemotherapeutic component only in a target-specific manner, while less stable linkers are prone to non-specific cleavage <Paper corpusId=\"4678281\" paperTitle=\"(Mehrling et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.
