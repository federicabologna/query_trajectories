However, a major disadvantage derived from the intrinsic properties of E. coli is the frequent formation of an inclusion body, a dense aggregate of misfolded polypeptides (Kane et al., 1991). Refolding the inclusion bodies into the native conformation might be straightforward if an efficient refolding scheme is established. There are a variety of conventional methodologies for refolding recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies, which contains simple dilution, dialysis and chromatographic refolding methods. Dilution is the simplest and most widely used technique and involves refolding initiation by reducing the denaturant concentration. However, the target product in dilution refolding can be obtained only very low yield because of protein aggregation at high protein concentration. Column-based refolding is the most likely to renaturate the protein aggregates at high concentration and to reduce the cost for reagents and buffers in largescale protein refolding (Langenhof et al., 2005). Although these conventional methods are commonly used for protein refolding and quite progress has been made, disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization have often frustrated the successful refolding of insoluble recombinant proteins containing cysteine and proline in multiple numbers (Clark et al., 1998)(Kiefhaber et al., 1990). Generation of correct disulfide bonds and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans configuration are required processes for formation and stabilization of the native protein conformation. Furthermore, the kinetics and thermodynamics of disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization can dominate the rate and pathway of protein folding and in turn determine the refolding efficiency [7](Tan et al., 1997)."], "score": 0.943359375}, {"id": "(Gasser et al., 2008)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 262692133, "title": "Protein folding and conformational stress in microbial cells producing recombinant proteins: a host comparative overview", "year": 2008, "venue": "Microbial Cell Factories", "authors": [{"name": "Brigitte Gasser", "authorId": "1908290"}, {"name": "M.

In this work, the bacteriophage lambda PL promoter is once again investigated as an inducible element but for the production of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Culture temperature, induction point, induction duration and number of inductions were considered as factors to maximize GFP production in a 20-L bioreactor.ResultsIt was found that cultures carried out at 37\u00b0C resulted in a growth-associated production of GFP without the need of an induction at 42\u00b0C. Specific production was similar to what was achieved when separating the growth and production phases. Shake flask cultures were used to screen for desirable operating conditions. It was found that multiple inductions increased the production of GFP. Induction decreased the growth rate and substrate yield coefficients; therefore, two time domains (before and after induction) having different kinetic parameters were created to fit a model to the data collected.ConclusionBased on two batch runs and the simulation of culture dynamics, a pre-defined feeding and induction strategy was developed to increase the volumetric yield of a temperature regulated expression system and was successfully implemented in a 20-L bioreactor.

A sucrose step gradient succeeded in separating aggregate subclasses of a GFP-GST fusion protein with specific biochemical and biophysical features, providing a novel approach for studying recombinant protein aggregates.ResultsThe total lysate separated into 4 different fractions whereas only the one with the lowest density was detected when the supernatant recovered after ultracentrifugation was loaded onto the sucrose gradient. The three further aggregate sub-classes were otherwise indistinctly precipitated in the pellet. The distribution of the recombinant protein among the four subclasses was strongly dependent on the DnaK availability, with larger aggregates formed in Dnak- mutants. The aggregation state of the GFP-GST recovered from each of the four fractions was further characterized by examining three independent biochemical parameters. All of them showed an increased complexity of the recombinant protein aggregates starting from the top of the sucrose gradient (lower mass aggregates) to the bottom (larger mass aggregates). These results were also confirmed by electron microscopy analysis of the macro-structure formed by the different aggregates. Large fibrils were rapidly assembled when the recombinant protein was incubated in the presence of cellular extracts, but the GFP-GST fusion purified soon after lysis failed to undergo amyloidation, indicating that other cell components probably participate in the active formation of large aggregates. Finally, we showed that aggregates of lower complexity are more efficiently disaggregated by a combination of molecular chaperones.ConclusionAn additional analytical tool is now available to investigate the aggregation process and separate subclasses by their mass. It was possible to demonstrate the complexity of the aggregation pattern of a recombinant protein expressed in bacteria and to characterize biochemically the different aggregate subclasses. Furthermore, we have obtained evidence that the cellular environment plays a role in the development of the aggregates and the problem of the artifact generation of aggregates has been discussed using in vitro models.

There are a variety of conventional methodologies for refolding recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies, which contains simple dilution, dialysis and chromatographic refolding methods. Dilution is the simplest and most widely used technique and involves refolding initiation by reducing the denaturant concentration. However, the target product in dilution refolding can be obtained only very low yield because of protein aggregation at high protein concentration. Column-based refolding is the most likely to renaturate the protein aggregates at high concentration and to reduce the cost for reagents and buffers in largescale protein refolding (Langenhof et al., 2005). Although these conventional methods are commonly used for protein refolding and quite progress has been made, disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization have often frustrated the successful refolding of insoluble recombinant proteins containing cysteine and proline in multiple numbers (Clark et al., 1998)(Kiefhaber et al., 1990). Generation of correct disulfide bonds and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans configuration are required processes for formation and stabilization of the native protein conformation.

In CI2, the slow-folding species can be classified into two groups by their rates of refolding, temperature-dependence, pH-dependence and [GdmCl]-dependence of the rate constants and the effect of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase on the rate constants. The replacement of Pro6 by Ala removes one of the slow refolding phases, suggesting that the cis peptidyl-Pro6 conformation is solely responsible for one of the slow-folding species. Pro6 is located in a region of the protein where non-random interactions have been found in a series of N-terminal fragments of CI2 (residues 1 to 13, 1 to 25, 1 to 28 and 1 to 40). In addition, NMR studies on a mutant fragment, (1-40)T3A, have confirmed that this non-native interaction is associated with the bulky side-chain of Trp5. The atypical rate of cis to trans isomerisation of the peptidyl-Pro bond is indicative of the presence of a similar hydrophobic cluster in the physiological denatured state of intact CI2."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Eichmann et al., 2019)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 203651627, "title": "Selection of High Producers From Combinatorial Libraries for the Production of Recombinant Proteins in Escherichia coli and Vibrio natriegens", "year": 2019, "venue": "Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology", "authors": [{"name": "Joel Eichmann", "authorId": "49738384"}, {"name": "M.
