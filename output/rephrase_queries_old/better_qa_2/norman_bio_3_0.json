However, BioBrick parts are only standardized in terms of how individual parts are physically assembled into multi-component systems, and most parts remain uncharacterized. Standardized tools, techniques, and units of measurement are needed to facilitate the characterization and reuse of parts by independent researchers across many laboratories.ResultsWe found that the absolute activity of BioBrick promoters varies across experimental conditions and measurement instruments. We choose one promoter (BBa_J23101) to serve as an in vivo reference standard for promoter activity. We demonstrated that, by measuring the activity of promoters relative to BBa_J23101, we could reduce variation in reported promoter activity due to differences in test conditions and measurement instruments by ~50%. We defined a Relative Promoter Unit (RPU) in order to report promoter characterization data in compatible units and developed a measurement kit so that researchers might more easily adopt RPU as a standard unit for reporting promoter activity. We distributed a set of test promoters to multiple labs and found good agreement in the reported relative activities of promoters so measured. We also characterized the relative activities of a reference collection of BioBrick promoters in order to further support adoption of RPU-based measurement standards.ConclusionRelative activity measurements based on an in vivoreference standard enables improved measurement of promoter activity given variation in measurement conditions and instruments.

Gently isolated human DNA was transformed directly into yeast spheroplasts along with two genetically marked (M1 and M2) linearized vectors that contained a human Alu sequence at one end and a telomere sequence at the other end (Alu-CEN-M1-TEL and Alu-M2-TEL). Nearly all the M1-selected transformants had yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing human DNA inserts that varied in size from 70 kb to > 600 kb. Approximately half of these had also acquired the unselected M2 marker. The mitotic segregational stability of YACs generated from one (M1) or two (M1 and M2) vector(s) was comparable, suggesting de novo generation of telomeric ends. Since no YACs were isolated when rodent DNAs or a vector lacking an Alu sequence was used, the YACs were most likely the consequence of TAR between the repeat elements on the vector(s) and the human DNA. Using the BLUR13 Alu-containing vector, we demonstrated that human DNA could be efficiently cloned from mouse cells that contained a single human chromosome 16. The distribution of cloned DNAs on chromosome 16 was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
