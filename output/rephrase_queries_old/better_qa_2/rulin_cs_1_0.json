Unlike traditional retrieve-then-read pipelines, FiD-Light employs a streamlined approach where the model simultaneously performs retrieval and answer generation. It uses an autoregressive decoder to process query-passage pairs and generate relevance signals, reducing computational overhead while maintaining strong performance. The model is particularly effective for open-domain question answering tasks where it can directly generate answers based on retrieved passages without requiring separate retriever and reader components. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\n## Neural Corpus Indexer (NCI)\nThe Neural Corpus Indexer introduces a fundamentally different retrieval paradigm by framing document retrieval as a sequence generation problem. Rather than computing similarity between query and document vectors, NCI directly generates document identifiers in response to queries. The model leverages the generative capabilities of autoregressive language models to produce document IDs in descending order of relevance to the query. This approach eliminates the need for explicit vector representations and similarity computations, instead relying on the model's learned knowledge of the corpus to identify relevant documents. NCI demonstrates how autoregressive models can transform the retrieval process into a generative task. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\n## GENRE (Generative Entity REtrieval)\nGENRE approaches entity retrieval through autoregressive generation by directly producing entity names token-by-token. Unlike dual-encoder models that require pre-computed entity embeddings, GENRE leverages the generative capacity of sequence-to-sequence models to output entity names directly. The model is trained to generate the titles of relevant Wikipedia pages given a query, effectively combining the retrieval and generation processes. This approach is particularly effective for entity-centric tasks where the model can leverage its parametric knowledge about entities and their relationships.

The model employs a sequential attention mechanism that allows it to attend to both query and document content while generating representations. Unlike standard dual-encoder models, SEAL enables limited cross-attention between queries and documents while maintaining efficient retrieval capabilities. The architecture progressively refines document representations through autoregressive steps, creating more contextually aware embeddings.

Instead of maintaining separate vector representations, DSI directly generates document content or identifiers in response to queries. The model is trained to produce relevant passages when prompted with queries, effectively embedding the entire retrieval process within the generative capabilities of the language model. This approach offers a radical departure from traditional retrieval paradigms by eliminating explicit indexes in favor of learned parametric knowledge.

Autoregressive models consistently demonstrate superior retrieval accuracy on standard datasets like MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA, with performance gains typically ranging from 10-30% on key metrics such as Recall@k, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe Neural Corpus Indexer (NCI) shows particularly impressive results, outperforming DPR by approximately 15-20% on Natural Questions and TriviaQA benchmarks in terms of Recall@20 and Recall@100 metrics. This performance advantage stems from NCI's ability to directly generate document identifiers rather than relying on similarity-based retrieval, allowing it to leverage the parametric knowledge embedded in the language model. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nFiD-Light similarly demonstrates strong performance, especially when evaluated on end-to-end question answering tasks. When compared to traditional retrieve-then-read pipelines using DPR for retrieval, FiD-Light achieves 8-12% higher Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores on common QA benchmarks. This improvement is attributed to its unified approach that jointly optimizes retrieval and answer generation rather than treating them as separate processes. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe GENRE model, when applied to entity retrieval tasks, outperforms bi-encoder baselines by substantial margins, showing 15-25% improvements in Recall@1 metrics on entity linking datasets. This performance gain highlights the advantage of directly generating entity names rather than ranking pre-computed entity embeddings. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nIn passage retrieval benchmarks, SEAL demonstrates more modest but consistent improvements over dual-encoder approaches like DPR and ColBERT, typically showing 5-10% gains in MRR and nDCG metrics.

(LLM Memory)", "text": "\nDespite the clear performance advantages demonstrated by autoregressive language models for retrieval tasks, these models present substantial qualitative trade-offs when compared to traditional dual-encoder approaches. The most significant trade-off centers on computational efficiency versus retrieval quality. Autoregressive models generally require significantly more computational resources during inference due to their sequential decoding process, resulting in slower retrieval times that can be 5-10x longer than vector similarity calculations in dual-encoder models <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nScalability represents another critical dimension where dual-encoder models maintain a distinct advantage. Traditional models like DPR and ColBERT support efficient indexing structures that enable retrieval from collections containing millions or even billions of documents. Their document representations can be pre-computed and stored in optimized vector databases that support approximate nearest neighbor search. In contrast, autoregressive models like NCI and DSI struggle with very large document collections, as they either need to generate increasingly longer sequences of document identifiers or maintain more complex internal representations of the corpus <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nMemory requirements further differentiate these approaches. Dual-encoder models typically require less memory during inference since they can process queries independently and leverage pre-computed document representations. Autoregressive models, especially those that incorporate document content directly into model parameters like DSI, demand substantially larger memory footprints, often requiring multiple GPU devices for deployment on reasonably sized document collections <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nFrom an implementation perspective, dual-encoder models offer greater flexibility for system integration. Their ability to separate encoding from similarity computation enables distributed architectures where document encoding happens offline, while only query encoding and vector matching occur at query time. Autoregressive models generally require end-to-end processing for each query, making them more challenging to optimize in distributed systems <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nTraining complexity also differs significantly between these approaches. Dual-encoder models can often be fine-tuned effectively with relatively modest compute resources and training data. In contrast, autoregressive retrieval models typically require more extensive training regimes, larger batch sizes, and more sophisticated optimization techniques to achieve their performance advantages <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nThe trade-offs extend to update scenarios as well. When new documents are added to a corpus, dual-encoder models can simply encode and index these additions without affecting existing representations. Autoregressive models like NCI or DSI may require more substantial retraining or fine-tuning to incorporate new information effectively into their generative capabilities <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nThese qualitative differences create distinct use-case considerations. Dual-encoder models remain preferable for applications requiring high throughput, large-scale retrieval, or strict latency constraints. Autoregressive models shine in scenarios where retrieval quality and semantic understanding take precedence over computational efficiency, such as specialized domain applications, complex question answering tasks, or systems where retrieval is less frequent but accuracy is paramount <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.", "citations": [], "table": null}], "cost": 0.119172}}
