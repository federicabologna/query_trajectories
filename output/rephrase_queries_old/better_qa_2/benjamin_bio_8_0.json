The conception of animal welfare used by scientists must relate closely to these ethical concerns if the orientation of the research and the interpretation of the findings is to address them successfully.At least three overlapping ethical concerns are commonly expressed regarding the quality of life of animals: (1) that animals should lead natural lives through the development and use of their natural adaptations and capabilities, (2) that animals should feel well by being free from prolonged and intense fear, pain, and other negative states, and by experiencing normal pleasures, and (3) that animals should function well, in the sense of satisfactory health, growth and normal functioning of physiological and behavioural systems. Various scientists have proposed restricted conceptions of animal welfare that relate to only one or other of these three concerns. Some such conceptions are based on value positions about what is truly important for the quality of life of animals or about the nature of human responsibility for animals in their care. Others are operational claims: (1) that animal welfare research must focus on the functioning of animals because subjective experiences fall outside the realm of scientific enquiry, or (2) that studying the functioning of animals is sufficient because subjective experiences and functioning are closely correlated. We argue that none of these positions provides fully satisfactory guidance for animal welfare research.We suggest instead that ethical concerns about the quality of life of animals can be better captured by recognizing three classes of problems that may arise when the adaptations possessed by an animal do not fully correspond to the challenges posed by its current environment. (I) If animals possess adaptations that no longer serve a significant function in the new environment, then unpleasant subjective experiences may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant disruption to biological functioning. Thus, a bucket-fed calf may experience a strong, frustrated desire to suck, even though it obtains adequate milk. (2) If the environment poses challenges for which the animal has no corresponding adaptation, then functional problems may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant effects on subjective feelings. Thus, a pig breathing polluted air may develop lung damage without appearing to notice or mind the problem. (3) Where animals have adaptations corresponding to the kinds of environmental challenges they face, problems may still arise if the adaptations prove inadequate. For example, an animal's thermoregulatory adaptations may be insufficient in a very cold environment such that the animal both feels poorly and functions poorly. We propose that all three types of problems are causes of ethical concern over the quality of life of animals and that they together define the subject matter of animal welfare science."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Hawthorne, 2024)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 267567406, "title": "Ethical and legislative advances in xenotransplantation for clinical translation: focusing on cardiac, kidney and islet cell xenotransplantation", "year": 2024, "venue": "Frontiers in Immunology", "authors": [{"name": "Wayne J.

This suggests the need for a more balanced ethical framework that considers both human and animal welfare.\n\nA central problem in this debate is that animals cannot provide informed consent for their use as organ sources. As Andrade et al. explain, \"In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent\" <Paper corpusId=\"267749482\" paperTitle=\"(Andrade et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221862396\" paperTitle=\"(Rollin, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"255213612\" paperTitle=\"(Bobier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMany animal rights organizations oppose xenotransplantation on principle, reflecting broader concerns about animal exploitation <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This perspective recognizes that pigs possess cognitive abilities and emotional capacities that merit moral consideration.\n\nFor vegetarians and those with certain religious beliefs, xenotransplantation presents a particular ethical dilemma. Thuan et al. note that \"For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings\" <Paper corpusId=\"271513704\" paperTitle=\"(Thuan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252108828\" paperTitle=\"(Hurst et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

As Zhai notes, \"Most people agree that it is at least sometimes justified to use animals to improve human welfare, but we also agree that we should minimize animal suffering, and that there are relevant differences between animal species. For example, most people reject using nonhuman primates to produce organs for human transplantation. However, the use of pigs is considered more acceptable\" <Paper corpusId=\"252891241\" paperTitle=\"(Zhai, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nProponents of xenotransplantation point to significant potential benefits, including \"relief of the long wait times for a suitable allograft, reduction in dialysis complications, and, especially in some parts of the world, elimination of coercion and financial compensation for organs\" <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. They also note that the number of animals needed for xenotransplantation would be \"significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone\" <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFrom a theological ethics perspective, Tanveer et al. suggest that \"a complete ban on xenotransplantation is not justifiable.

This middle-ground position acknowledges both the value of human life and the importance of animal welfare considerations.\n\nAs xenotransplantation moves toward clinical implementation, Eissa et al. emphasize that scientists and clinicians must thoroughly address animal welfare concerns, warning that \"unless there are major changes in the way science is taught to incorporate ethics into recognized scientific theory and practice, these concerns will not be adequately addressed\" <Paper corpusId=\"255364318\" paperTitle=\"(Eissa et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.
