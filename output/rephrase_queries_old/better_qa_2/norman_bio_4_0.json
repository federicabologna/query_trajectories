Receiver operating curve (ROC) was used to calculate the cut off value and comparison between TB and non-TB groups were done by the chi-square test.ResultsThe indirect ELISA method, using an mAb against Ag 85 complex, yielded 82% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 67 to 93%) and 86% specificity (95% CI, 57 to 98%) for the diagnosis of TB. The serum positivities for Ag 85 complex in cases of confirmed and clinically diagnosed TB patients were 96% (23/24) and 79% (82/104) respectively, while the positivity for patients in the non-tuberculosis group was 14% (10/69).ConclusionThe detection of Ag 85 complex in sera from TB patients by indirect ELISA using mAb against purified Ag 85 complex gives a reliable diagnosis and can be used to develop an immunodiagnostic assay with increased sensitivity and specificity."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Kuhn et al., 2016)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 31871816, "title": "Recombinant antibodies for diagnostics and therapy against pathogens and toxins generated by phage display", "year": 2016, "venue": "PROTEOMICS - Clinical Applications", "authors": [{"name": "P.

F1 is encoded by the caf1 gene located on the large 100-kb pFra plasmid, which is found in Y. pestis but not in closely related species such as Yersinia enterocolytica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. In order to find antibodies specifically binding to Y. pestis we screened a large single chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library using purified F1 antigen as a selection target. Different forms of the selected antibodies were used to establish assays for recombinant F1 antigen and Y. pestis detection. Methods Phage antibody panning was performed against F1 in an automated fashion using the Kingfisher magnetic bead system. Selected scFvs were screened for F1-binding specificity by one-step alkaline phosphatase enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), and assayed for binding to recombinant antigen and/or Y. pestis by flow cytometry and whole-cell ELISA. Results Seven of the eight selected scFvs were shown to specifically bind both recombinant F1 and a panel of F1-positive Yersinia cells. The majority of the soluble scFvs were found to be difficult to purify, unstable and prone to cross-reactivity with F1-negative Yersinia strains, whereas phage displayed scFvs were found to be easy to purify/label and remarkably stable. Furthermore direct fluorescent labeling of phage displaying scFv allowed for an easy one-step flow cytometry assay. Slight cross-reactivity was observed when fixed cells were used in ELISA. Conclusions Our high throughput methods of selection and screening allowed for time and cost effective discovery of seven scFvs specifically binding Y. pestis F1 antigen.

These recombinant antibodies can be collected quickly at lower costs while maintaining comparable affinity to traditional antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"270748518\" paperTitle=\"(Sadraeian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This economic advantage becomes increasingly important when developing diagnostic platforms for resource-limited settings or when large quantities of antibodies are required.\n\nAnother significant benefit is the versatility and adaptability of phage display-derived antibodies.

For example, VHH (nanobody) constructs immobilized onto sensor surfaces have demonstrated the ability to detect subnanogram per milliliter concentrations of human prostate-specific antigen (hPSA) <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"29607203\" paperTitle=\"(Saerens et al., 2005)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Herein, we report the development of a dipstick using a AuNP-labeled single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody for the detection of morphine. The scFv antibodies for morphine were developed using phage display-based antibody library. Immunoglobulin variable regions of heavy (VH)- and light (VL)-chain genes were connected via a glycine\u2013serine linker isolated from murine immune repertoire and cloned into the expression vector pIT2. The scFv was produced in Escherichia coli HB2151, yielding a functional protein with a molecular weight of approximately 32 kDa. The morphine scFv was labeled with gold nanoparticles and used as an optical immunoprobe in a dipstick. The competitive dipstick assay characterized the ability of the scFv antibody to recognize free morphine. The detection range was 1\u20131000 ng mL\u22121 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5 ng mL\u22121 under optimal conditions, and the IC50 value was 14 ng mL\u22121 for morphine.

Different viral markers can be optimally detected at different stages of infection. Of particular clinical importance is the early identification of infection, which is pivotal for disease management and the development of blood screening assays. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an early surrogate marker of infection and its detection in serum coincides with detectable viraemia. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterise serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind to NS1 for each of the four DENV serotypes. This was achieved using phage display and a subtractive biopanning strategy to direct the antibody selection towards serotype-specific epitopes. This antibody isolation strategy has advantages over immunisation techniques where it is difficult to avoid antibody responses to cross-reactive, immunodominant epitopes. Serotype specificity to recombinant antigen for each of the antibodies was confirmed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Surface Plasmon Resonance. Confirmation of binding to native DENV NS1 was achieved using ELISA and immunofluorescence assay on DENV infected Vero cells. No cross-reactivity with Zika or Kunjin viruses was observed. A previously isolated pan-reactive antibody that binds to an immunodominant epitope was able to pair with each of the serotype-specific antibodies in a sandwich ELISA, indicating that the serotype specific antibodies bind to epitopes which are all spatially distinct from the immunodominant epitope. These antibodies were suitable for use in a multiplexed assay for simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV NS1 in human serum. This work demonstrates that phage display coupled with novel biopanning strategies is a valuable in vitro methodology for isolation of binders that can discern amongst antigens with high homology for diagnostic applicability."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Akter et al., 2016)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 23089753, "title": "Broad-Spectrum Noncompetitive Immunocomplex Immunoassay for Cyanobacterial Peptide Hepatotoxins (Microcystins and Nodularins).", "year": 2016, "venue": "Analytical Chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "S.

However, the development of an essential antibody pair capable of sandwich-type recognition of the analytes' small generic core structure is a demanding task due to limited space available for simultaneous binding of two different antibodies. We report here a generic noncompetitive assay for cyanobacterial microcystins (MCs) and nodularins (Nod), a group of structurally related small cyclic peptides (\u223c1000 Da) with more than 100 naturally occurring analogs. The assay is based on the unique combination of a generic anti-immunocomplex (anti-IC) single-chain fragment of antibody variable domain (scFv) and a monoclonal antibody capable of binding to an Adda-group (3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4(E),6(E)-dienoic acid) present in all MCs/Nod. The anti-IC scFv was isolated from a large synthetic antibody library with phage display and used to develop a single-step sandwich-type noncompetitive immunocomplex assay. The sensitive time-resolved immunofluorometry-based assay is capable of detecting all the 11 tested commonly occurring hepatotoxins (MC-LR, -dmlR, -RR, -dmRR, -LA, -LY, -LF, -LW, -YR, -WR, and Nod-R) at concentration below 0.1 \u03bcg/L in a 1 h assay. Using MC-LR, the most studied toxic and widely distributed of the toxins, the calculated detection limits (based on blank + 3SD response) are \u223c0.026 \u03bcg/L in 1 h and \u223c0.1 \u03bcg/L in 10 min assay time. This is by far the fastest reported immunoassay for MCs and Nod with a detection limit far below the World Health Organization's guideline limit (1 \u03bcg/L of MC-LR equivalent in drinking water). The assay was validated with spiked tap and lake water as well as with environmental surface water samples. The developed assay provides a simple, rapid, and highly sensitive tool for the quantitative detection of MCs/Nod with the additional benefit of automation and high-throughput possibilities for large scale screening of drinking and environmental surface water samples. Furthermore, the study describes the first demonstration of the assay intended for the detection of an analyte group comprising similar low-molecular weight compounds exhibiting the benefits of a reagent excess type assay."], "score": 0.0}], "table": null}], "cost": 0.21388200000000002}}
