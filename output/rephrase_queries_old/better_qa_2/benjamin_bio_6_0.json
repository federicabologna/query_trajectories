Linkers generally fall into one of two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers rely on differences in the blood microenvironment and intracellular tumor environment to induce linker degradation. These take three forms: hydrazone, disulfide and peptide linkers, each of which is cleaved or degraded through a different mechanism (Peters et al., 2015). Hydrazone linkers are pH-sensitive and undergo acidic hydrolysis in the lysosomal microenvironment (Peters et al., 2015). Disulfide linkers are degraded by thiols, which commonly accumulate in tumor cells, where they act as antioxidants (Peters et al., 2015)(Harris et al., 2015). Peptide linkers are degraded by pH-dependent proteases, which are only active in the lysosome (Peters et al., 2015). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers rely on the near-complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the cytotoxic agent. This makes them entirely dependent on being endocytosed to release their drug product.

Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine.

Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment (Singh et al., 2016). ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019).

Cleavable linkers exhibit sensitivity to intracellular environmental conditions and could be cleaved by acid, protease, a reducing substance, and so on (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Typically, these linkers, including hydrazone bonds, disulfide bonds, and polypeptides, are cleaved within endosomes or lysosomes.

Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019). The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization (Gondi et al., 2013). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity.

ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors (Mccombs et al., 2015)(Chari et al., 2014). \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated (Lu et al., 2016)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities (Lu et al., 2016)."], "score": 0.89794921875}, {"id": "(Gogia et al., 2023)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 260408796, "title": "Antibody\u2013Drug Conjugates: A Review of Approved Drugs and Their Clinical Level of Evidence", "year": 2023, "venue": "Cancers", "authors": [{"name": "Pooja Gogia", "authorId": "1825753387"}, {"name": "Hamza Ashraf", "authorId": "79544447"}, {"name": "Sidharth Bhasin", "authorId": "32907042"}, {"name": "Yiqing Xu", "authorId": "48615260"}], "n_citations": 80}, "snippets": ["Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019). The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization (Gondi et al., 2013). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]."], "score": 0.91943359375}, {"id": "(Metrangolo et al., 2024)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 267191025, "title": "Antibody\u2013Drug Conjugates: The Dynamic Evolution from Conventional to Next-Generation Constructs", "year": 2024, "venue": "Cancers", "authors": [{"name": "Virginia Metrangolo", "authorId": "2136179643"}, {"name": "L.

The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) (Ding et al., 2021). These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing (Joubert et al., 2020)(Fu et al., 2022)(Sheyi et al., 2022). Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity.

This is possible because the extracellular environment of the tumor is highly reducing due to the presence of glutathione, which allows the release of payloads linked to the antibody via thiolic bonds. It also allows payload release via the degradation of peptide bonds in the presence of proteases such as Cathepsin B, whose overexpression in cancer drives its normal lysosomal localization towards extracellular secretion (Mohamed et al., 2006). A cleavable linker, therefore, exploits differential conditions of reducing power or enzymatic degradation that can be present either outside or inside the target cell. Due to the chemical reactions needed to release the payload, the site of conjugation on the antibody is crucial to induce both stability in the plasma and availability to reduction or degradation on/into the target cell (Phillips et al., 2008)(Dorywalska et al., 2015).

The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity (Erickson et al., 2006)[130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload (Bargh et al., 2019).

Hydrazone linkers are pH-sensitive and undergo acidic hydrolysis in the lysosomal microenvironment (Peters et al., 2015). Disulfide linkers are degraded by thiols, which commonly accumulate in tumor cells, where they act as antioxidants (Peters et al., 2015)(Harris et al., 2015). Peptide linkers are degraded by pH-dependent proteases, which are only active in the lysosome (Peters et al., 2015).

The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019). The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization (Gondi et al., 2013). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]."], "score": 0.91943359375}, {"id": "(Nguyen et al., 2023)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 256296397, "title": "Mechanisms of ADC Toxicity and Strategies to Increase ADC Tolerability", "year": 2023, "venue": "Cancers", "authors": [{"name": "T.

These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes (Mccombs et al., 2015).

This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment (Singh et al., 2016).
