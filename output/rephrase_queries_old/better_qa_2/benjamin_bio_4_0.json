When localized photons are used to activate both imaging and therapeutic functions such as photodynamic or photothermal therapy, these theranostic nanolights increase treatment efficacy with minimized damage to surrounding healthy tissues, which represents a promising noninvasive nanomedicine as compared to conventional theranostic approaches. As one of the most promising theranostic nanolights, organic dots with aggregation-induced emission (AIE dots) are biocompatible nanoparticles with a dense core of AIE fluorogens (AIEgens) and protective shells, whose sizes are in the range of a few to tens of nanometers. Different from conventional fluorophores that suffer from aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) due to \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction in the aggregate state, AIEgens emit strongly as nanoaggregates due to the restriction of intramolecular motions. Through precise molecular engineering, AIEgens could also be designed to show efficient photosensitizing or photothermal abilities in the aggregate state. Different from ACQ dyes, AIEgens allow high loading in nanoparticles without compromised performance, which makes them the ideal cores for theranostic nanolights to offer high brightness for imaging and strong photoactivities for theranostic applications. In this Account, we summarize the recent advance of AIE dots and highlight their great potential as theranostic nanolights in biomedical applications. Starting from the design of AIEgens, the fabrication of AIE dots and their bioimaging applications are discussed. The exceptional advantages of superbrightness, high resistance to photobleaching, lack of emission intermittency, and excellent biocompatibility have made them reliable cross platform contrast agents for different imaging techniques such as confocal microscopy, multiphoton fluorescence microscopy, super-resolution nanoscopy, and light-sheet ultramicroscopy, which have been successfully applied for cell tracking, vascular disease diagnosis, and image-guided surgery. The integration of therapeutic functions with customized AIEgens has further empowered AIE dots as an excellent theranostic platform for image-guided phototherapy. Of particular interest is AIE photosensitizer dots, which simultaneously show bright fluorescence and high photosensitization, yielding superior performance to commercial photosensitizer nanoparticles in image-guided therapy. Further development in multiphoton excited photodynamic therapy has offered precise treatment with up to 5 \u03bcm resolution at 200 \u03bcm depth, while chemiexcited photodynamic therapy has completely eliminated the limitation of penetration depth to realize power-free imaging and therapy.

Optical agents are generally involved in biophotonics to interpret biomolecular events into readable optical signals for imaging and diagnosis or to convert photons into other forms of energy (such as heat, mechanical force, or chemical radicals) for therapeutic intervention and biological stimulation. Development of new optical agents including metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, and silica nanoparticles has contributed to the advancement of this field. However, most of these agents have their own merits and demerits, making them less effective as multimodal biophotonic platforms. In this Account, we summarize our recent work on the development of near-infrared (NIR) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as multimodal light converters for advanced biophotonics. SPNs are composed of \u03c0-electron delocalized semiconducting polymers (SPs) and often possess the advantages of good biocompatibility, high photostability, and large absorption coefficients. Because the photophysical properties of SPNs are mainly determined by the molecular structures of the precursor polymers, molecular engineering allows us to fine tune their photophysical processes to obtain different optical responses, even to light in the second NIR window (1000-1700 nm). Meanwhile, the facile nanoformulation methods of SPNs enable alteration of their outer and inner structures for diverse biological interactions. The unique photophysical properties of SPNs have brought about ultrasensitive deep-tissue molecular imaging. NIR-absorbing SPNs with strong charge-transfer backbones can convert photoenergy into mechanical acoustic waves, permitting photoacoustic imaging that bypasses the issue of light scattering and reaches the centimeter tissue penetration depth. Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios. So far, SPN-based molecular photoacoustic or afterglow probes have been developed to image disease tissues (tumors), biomarkers (biothiols and reactive oxygen species), and physiological indexes (pH and temperature) in different preclinical animal models. The synthetic flexibility of SPNs further permits light-modulated biological and therapeutic interventions. Till now, SPNs with high photothermal conversion efficiencies have been shaped into photothermal transducers to remotely regulate biological events including protein ion channels, enzymatic activity, and gene expression. In conjunction with the desired biodistribution and tumor-homing ability, SPNs have been doped or coated with other inorganic agents for amplified photothermal or self-regulated photodynamic cancer therapy.

Optical agents are generally involved in biophotonics to interpret biomolecular events into readable optical signals for imaging and diagnosis or to convert photons into other forms of energy (such as heat, mechanical force, or chemical radicals) for therapeutic intervention and biological stimulation. Development of new optical agents including metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, and silica nanoparticles has contributed to the advancement of this field. However, most of these agents have their own merits and demerits, making them less effective as multimodal biophotonic platforms. In this Account, we summarize our recent work on the development of near-infrared (NIR) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as multimodal light converters for advanced biophotonics. SPNs are composed of \u03c0-electron delocalized semiconducting polymers (SPs) and often possess the advantages of good biocompatibility, high photostability, and large absorption coefficients. Because the photophysical properties of SPNs are mainly determined by the molecular structures of the precursor polymers, molecular engineering allows us to fine tune their photophysical processes to obtain different optical responses, even to light in the second NIR window (1000-1700 nm). Meanwhile, the facile nanoformulation methods of SPNs enable alteration of their outer and inner structures for diverse biological interactions. The unique photophysical properties of SPNs have brought about ultrasensitive deep-tissue molecular imaging. NIR-absorbing SPNs with strong charge-transfer backbones can convert photoenergy into mechanical acoustic waves, permitting photoacoustic imaging that bypasses the issue of light scattering and reaches the centimeter tissue penetration depth. Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios. So far, SPN-based molecular photoacoustic or afterglow probes have been developed to image disease tissues (tumors), biomarkers (biothiols and reactive oxygen species), and physiological indexes (pH and temperature) in different preclinical animal models. The synthetic flexibility of SPNs further permits light-modulated biological and therapeutic interventions. Till now, SPNs with high photothermal conversion efficiencies have been shaped into photothermal transducers to remotely regulate biological events including protein ion channels, enzymatic activity, and gene expression. In conjunction with the desired biodistribution and tumor-homing ability, SPNs have been doped or coated with other inorganic agents for amplified photothermal or self-regulated photodynamic cancer therapy.
