Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019).

Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Sequencing of full-length scFvs is important for covering both VH and VL diversity, which is critical in assessing quality of such libraries and their utility for drug discovery (Hemadou et al., 2017;Han et al., 2018)."], "score": 0.7841796875}, {"id": "(Briney et al., 2018)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 58546088, "title": "Commonality despite exceptional diversity in the baseline human antibody repertoire", "year": 2018, "venue": "Nature", "authors": [{"name": "Bryan S.

MinION sequencing permits confident assignment to species level within 20 min. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 min and determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SMRT cells.

We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH.

Deep sequencing techniques have revolutionized phage display library characterization by addressing many traditional weaknesses and enabling more comprehensive analysis of diversity and biases present in these libraries <Paper corpusId=\"18622192\" paperTitle=\"(Brinton et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This transformation has been particularly evident in the assessment of library quality and composition, where next-generation sequencing has revealed critical insights that were impossible to detect with traditional methods.\n\nOne of the most striking revelations from high-throughput sequencing of peptide libraries has been the discovery of dramatic diversity collapses during amplification. Matochko and colleagues demonstrated that phage-displayed peptide libraries can experience a collapse from theoretically millions of sequences to just a few hundred abundant sequences after a single round of growth in bacteria - a phenomenon that would have remained undetectable using small-scale Sanger sequencing <Paper corpusId=\"4632668\" paperTitle=\"(Matochko et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. This insight has fundamentally changed our understanding of library quality and amplification dynamics.\n\nThe selection of sequencing platform significantly impacts characterization outcomes for antibody libraries. For comprehensive repertoire analysis, Illumina platforms remain optimal due to their ability to produce hundreds of millions of reads at relatively low cost. However, their application is limited to sequencing individual variable domains or CDR3 regions rather than full-length antibody fragments <Paper corpusId=\"199451388\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation restricts the information that can be obtained about paired VH:VL domains, which is crucial for assessing library quality and utility in drug discovery <Paper corpusId=\"221406320\" paperTitle=\"(Csepregi et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor full-length characterization of antibody fragments, long-read technologies have demonstrated unique value despite their historically lower throughput. PacBio sequencing coupled with SMRTbell technology has enabled the generation of highly accurate full-length scFv sequence repertoires, facilitating rapid isolation and testing of antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This capability has led to the identification of functional antibodies that were not detected by conventional screening methods, demonstrating the complementary value of comprehensive sequencing to traditional panning approaches.\n\nA critical consideration for library characterization is the balance between sequencing depth and read length. While long-read technologies like PacBio can sequence complete antibody fragments, they typically provide relatively low numbers of reads (up to 8\u00d710\u2074) compared to Illumina <Paper corpusId=\"249254439\" paperTitle=\"(Moura-Sampaio et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The PacBio Sequel II system offers greater accuracy and higher throughput than previous models, providing larger pools of scFvs for analysis <Paper corpusId=\"271114246\" paperTitle=\"(Salvy et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These advancements are enabling more comprehensive characterization of antibody libraries, with recent approaches yielding more than 14,700 high-quality, fully annotated unique scFv sequences from a single library <Paper corpusId=\"271114246\" paperTitle=\"(Salvy et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOxford Nanopore technology has also demonstrated utility for phage display library characterization despite its historically higher error rate. Lowden and colleagues showed that while overall data fidelity was lower than Illumina, sequences could be reliably reconstructed when present above approximately 100 copies. This capability proved sufficient for rapid identification of antigen-specific sequences enriched during panning, potentially eliminating the need for screening individual clones <Paper corpusId=\"53791733\" paperTitle=\"(Lowden et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor applications requiring both long reads and high accuracy, hybrid approaches combining multiple sequencing technologies have shown promise. Cook and colleagues demonstrated that combining Illumina and Nanopore reads reduced error rates to levels comparable with short-read-only assemblies, providing more comprehensive insights than any single platform <Paper corpusId=\"268359948\" paperTitle=\"(Cook et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. These hybrid approaches can be particularly valuable for capturing both the depth and length information needed for comprehensive library characterization.\n\nAs sequencing technologies continue to advance, they are enabling increasingly sophisticated analyses of phage display libraries.

Deep resolution of the vast immune repertoire sequence space enables better insights into the diversity of unique BCR and TCR sequences (>10 13 in humans) and allows detection of shared clones across individuals, so called ''public clones'' (Soto et al., 2019;Briney et al., 2019;Greiff et al., 2017a;DeWitt et al., 2018).\n\nPaired-end sequencing on Illumina allows coverage of one variable region of immune receptors; however, for approaches that rely on complete immune receptor sequence coverage and hence require longer read lengths, an alternative platform is offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Eid et al., 2009). PacBio's sequencing technology is based on single-molecule sequencing. Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Sequencing of full-length scFvs is important for covering both VH and VL diversity, which is critical in assessing quality of such libraries and their utility for drug discovery (Hemadou et al., 2017;Han et al., 2018)."], "score": 0.7841796875}, {"id": "(Nannini et al., 2020)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 229940603, "title": "Combining phage display with SMRTbell next-generation sequencing for the rapid discovery of functional scFv fragments", "year": 2020, "venue": "mAbs", "authors": [{"name": "F.
