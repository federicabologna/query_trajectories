Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (\\aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution.

Given the inherent characteristics of these techniques, a series of novel legal problems arise. In this article, we consider a set of key questions in the area of GDL for the arts, including the following: is it possible to use copyrighted works as training set for generative models? How do we legally store their copies in order to perform the training process? Who (if someone) will own the copyright on the generated data? We try to answer these questions considering the law in force in both the United States and the European Union, and potential future alternatives.

This form of infringement primarily involves the model developers who collect and use the training data, raising questions about fair use that parallel those in other contexts like search engine indexing and book digitization <Paper corpusId=\"257050406\" paperTitle=\"(Vyas et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn contrast, deployment-phase infringement presents a fundamentally different technical challenge. Here, a user provides a prompt to the model and receives an output that may be \"either a verbatim copy or substantially similar to some copyrighted training data\" <Paper corpusId=\"257050406\" paperTitle=\"(Vyas et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Unlike training-phase infringement, deployment involves an interaction between the user's prompt and the model's learned parameters, creating a more complex chain of causality for copyright violations.\n\nA key technical distinction between these phases lies in how diffusion models process inputs. During training, these models accept text-image pairs, whereas during inference (deployment), they typically only receive text prompts <Paper corpusId=\"266900037\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This difference in input processing creates unique vulnerability patterns in each phase. For example, backdoor attacks\u2014which are designed to induce copyright-infringing outputs\u2014must account for this asymmetry, with triggers implemented as specific prompts during deployment while backdoors are poisoned image-caption pairs during training <Paper corpusId=\"266900037\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe detection of copyright infringement also differs technically between phases. Training-phase infringement might be identified through inspection of the training dataset, though this approach has significant limitations <Paper corpusId=\"269033217\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Deployment-phase infringement is typically detected through output similarity to known copyrighted works, but establishing a causal link to training data remains challenging due to the \"uninterpretability of generative models\" <Paper corpusId=\"273023255\" paperTitle=\"(Chiba-Okabe, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent research has identified more sophisticated mechanisms for concealed copyright infringement that exploit the technical differences between phases. For instance, latent diffusion models can produce images similar to copyrighted works even without direct inclusion of those works in the training data by reproducing content from other images with similar latent information <Paper corpusId=\"273023255\" paperTitle=\"(Chiba-Okabe, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Differential Privacy is such a definition.After motivating and discussing the meaning of differential privacy, the preponderance of this monograph is devoted to fundamental techniques for achieving differential privacy, and application of these techniques in creative combinations, using the query-release problem as an ongoing example. A key point is that, by rethinking the computational goal, one can often obtain far better results than would be achieved by methodically replacing each step of a non-private computation with a differentially private implementation. Despite some astonishingly powerful computational results, there are still fundamental limitations \u2014 not just on what can be achieved with differential privacy but on what can be achieved with any method that protects against a complete breakdown in privacy. Virtually all the algorithms discussed herein maintain differential privacy against adversaries of arbitrary computational power. Certain algorithms are computationally intensive, others are efficient. Computational complexity for the adversary and the algorithm are both discussed.We then turn from fundamentals to applications other than queryrelease, discussing differentially private methods for mechanism design and machine learning. The vast majority of the literature on differentially private algorithms considers a single, static, database that is subject to many analyses.

Copyright infringement can occur in two distinct phases: training and deployment. During the training phase, the algorithm directly accesses copyrighted material, potentially encoding verbatim copies within its weights.

Unlike search engines, generative models don't track the provenance of their outputs, making it difficult for users to verify potential infringement <Paper corpusId=\"257050406\" paperTitle=\"(Vyas et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This creates a legal gray area where both the user and the AI developer may potentially be considered direct or indirect infringers, depending on specific circumstances <Paper corpusId=\"273023255\" paperTitle=\"(Chiba-Okabe, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA critical legal consideration is that copyright infringement may occur even without intentional replication of protected content. Neither the user nor the developer needs to deliberately aim to copy copyrighted material for infringement to take place <Paper corpusId=\"273023255\" paperTitle=\"(Chiba-Okabe, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This unintentional infringement creates significant challenges for liability determination and risk management.\n\nThe opacity of generative models further complicates legal proceedings. Due to the \"uninterpretability\" of these models, providing direct evidence of copying is extremely difficult. Instead, legal cases will likely rely on access and similarity as primary evidence of infringement, similar to traditional copyright disputes <Paper corpusId=\"273023255\" paperTitle=\"(Chiba-Okabe, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The inclusion of copyrighted works in training data may constitute sufficient \"access\" from a legal perspective, especially since studies have demonstrated that exposure to specific content during training correlates with a higher probability of producing similar outputs <Paper corpusId=\"273023255\" paperTitle=\"(Chiba-Okabe, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"229156229\" paperTitle=\"(Carlini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256389993\" paperTitle=\"(Carlini et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA unique characteristic of generative models that distinguishes them from human creators is their ability to train on massive, diverse datasets often scraped from the internet.

Here, the question of what constitutes a copyright infringement is largely a question of \"fair use.\" This work does not examine these fair use issues that arise in the training phase, and we refer the reader to the several legal precedents in this area [Samuelson, 2021].\n\nThe second notable source of potential infringement is in the deployment phase, where a user provides a prompt x to the model to obtain some output y.

In most cases, access and similarity will likely serve as the primary evidence of infringement, much like in traditional copyright disputes [28]. While the creative processes of generative models differ markedly from human creativity, it appears that similar evidentiary principles are likely to apply even when generative AI is involved in the creative processes. At a minimum, it is generally recognized that some form of access to the original work, which may be demonstrated by its inclusion in the training data, is necessary to establish copying, even for generative AI outputs [28,29,36]. Moreover, studies have shown that exposure to certain types of content during training can lead to a high likelihood of these models reproducing or closely imitating that content (Carlini et al., 2020)(Carlini et al., 2023)[39], suggesting that inclusion of specific data correlates with a greater probability of producing similar outputs through copying. This echoes the evidentiary framework applicable to traditional copyright cases, where greater similarity between works strengthens the inference of access and copying. \n\nA distinctive feature of generative models, setting them apart from human artists or traditional creative tools, is their capacity to be trained on immense and diverse datasets, which are often created by scraping content from the Internet.
