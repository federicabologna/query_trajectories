However, the function and ultimate efficiency of nanomedicines remain unsatisfactory for clinical application, mainly because of our insufficient understanding of nanomaterial/nanomedicine-biology (nano-bio) interactions. The nonequilibrated, complex, and heterogeneous nature of the biological milieu inevitably influences the dynamic bioidentity of nanoformulations at each site (i.e., the interfaces at different biological fluids (biofluids), environments, or biological structures) of nano-bio interactions. The continuous interplay between a nanomedicine and the biological molecules and structures in the biological environments can, for example, affect cellular uptake or completely alter the designed function of the nanomedicine. Accordingly, the weak and strong driving forces at the nano-bio interface may elicit structural reconformation, decrease bioactivity, and induce dysfunction of the nanomaterial and/or redox reactions with biological molecules, all of which may elicit unintended and unexpected biological outcomes. In contrast, these driving forces also can be manipulated to mitigate the toxicity of ENMs or improve the targeting abilities of ENMs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nano-bio interactions is paramount for the intelligent design of safe and effective nanomedicines. In this Account, we summarize our recent progress in probing the nano-bio interaction of nanomedicines, focusing on the driving force and redox reaction at the nano-bio interface, which have been recognized as the main factors that regulate the functions and toxicities of nanomedicines. First, we provide insight into the driving force that shapes the boundary of different nano-bio interfaces (including proteins, cell membranes, and biofluids), for instance, hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bond, molecular recognition, metal-coordinate, and stereoselective interactions that influence the different nano-bio interactions at each contact site in the biological environment. The physicochemical properties of both the nanoparticle and the biomolecule are varied, causing structure recombination, dysfunction, and bioactivity loss of proteins; correspondingly, the surface properties, biological functions, intracellular uptake pathways, and fate of ENMs are also influenced. Second, with the help of these driving forces, four kinds of redox interactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant, sorbate, and the prosthetic group of oxidoreductases are utilized to regulate the intracellular redox equilibrium and construct synergetic nanomedicines for combating bacteria and cancers. Three kinds of electron-transfer mechanisms are involved in designing nanomedicines, including direct electron injection, sorbate-mediated, and irradiation-induced processes. Finally, we discuss the factors that influence the nano-bio interactions and propose corresponding strategies to manipulate the nano-bio interactions for advancing nanomedicine design.

Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads.

SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues.

We further demonstrated that our lung-targeting LNP could effectively deliver mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA into TSC2-null cells and restore its function, resulting in enhanced control of tumor burden in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Safe and efficacious systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific organs and cells in vivo remains the major challenge in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene.

From a translational angle, we studied the interaction of fully characterized PMOXA-coated vinyltriethoxysilane-derived organically modified silica NPs (PMOXA-coated NPs) of approximately 100 nm in diameter with human complement system, blood leukocytes, and macrophages and compared their performance with PEGylated and uncoated NP counterparts.

Upon introduction to a complex biological system (e.g., following systemic administration), nanomaterials interact with all the encountered biomolecules and form the protein corona, a complex coating of plasma proteins that provides them with a totally new biological identity.

Over the past years, several approaches and compounds developed for the treatment of AD have failed in clinical studies, likely in part due to their low penetration of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Since nanotechnology-based strategies offer new possibilities for the delivery of drugs to the brain, this technique is studied intensively for the treatment of AD and other neurological disorders.MethodsThe A\u03b242 lowering drug flurbiprofen was embedded in polylactide (PLA) nanoparticles by emulsification-diffusion technique and their potential as drug carriers in an in vitro BBB model was examined. First, the cytotoxic potential of the PLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles on endothelial cells and the cellular binding and uptake by endothelial cells was studied. Furthermore, the biological activity of the nanoparticulate flurbiprofen on \u03b3-secretase modulation as well as its in vitro release was examined. Furthermore, the protein corona of the nanoparticles was studied as well as their ability to transport flurbiprofen across an in vitro BBB model.ResultsPLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles were endocytosed by endothelial cells and neither affected the vitality nor barrier function of the endothelial cell monolayer. The exposure of the PLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles to human plasma occurred in a rapid protein corona formation, resulting in their decoration with bioactive proteins, including apolipoprotein E. Furthermore, luminally administered PLA-flurbiprofen nanoparticles in contrast to free flurbiprofen were able to modulate \u03b3-secretase activity by selectively decreasing A\u03b242 levels in the abluminal compartment of the BBB model.ConclusionsIn this study, we were able to show that flurbiprofen can be transported by PLA nanoparticles across an in vitro BBB model and most importantly, the transported flurbiprofen modulated \u03b3-secretase activity by selectively decreasing A\u03b242 levels.

(11 sources)", "text": "\nThe composition of the protein corona significantly influences the biological fate of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), affecting their circulation time, biodistribution, and cellular uptake. Therefore, controlling this composition has become a critical aspect of nanoparticle design. One of the most established approaches is surface modification with polyethylene glycol (PEG), which has been shown to suppress protein adsorption, resulting in decreased macrophage uptake and longer circulation times <Paper corpusId=\"18868708\" paperTitle=\"(Treuel et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This \"stealth\" strategy effectively reduces opsonization by immunoglobulins and complement proteins that would otherwise lead to rapid clearance.\n\nPre-coating nanoparticles with specific proteins represents another important strategy. Pre-coating with human serum albumin can prevent rapid clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and modulate cellular uptake mechanisms, switching internalization from macropinocytosis to clathrin-mediated endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"233880875\" paperTitle=\"(Mazumdar et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, pre-coating with apolipoprotein E has been shown to alter pharmacokinetic characteristics and prolong circulation time without increasing cytotoxicity <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"203654456\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach can also enhance the transport of nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier, as demonstrated by poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles coated with ApoE that showed significant anti-nociceptive action compared to uncoated nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"233880875\" paperTitle=\"(Mazumdar et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA more sophisticated approach involves peptide functionalization that selectively recruits beneficial proteins to the corona. For example, Zhang et al. reported the modification of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide derived from A\u03b21-42 that specifically binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins while leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins <Paper corpusId=\"244811268\" paperTitle=\"(Ribovski et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"199491776\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This \"corona-mediated targeting\" strategy resulted in notable increases in brain distribution of the nanoparticles.\n\nConversely, researchers have developed approaches to minimize the negative impacts of protein corona formation on targeting capabilities. The formation of protein corona can significantly hinder the interaction between targeting ligands and their receptors, causing nanoparticles to lose their targeting abilities. This has been observed with various targeting moieties including bicyclononyne <Paper corpusId=\"244897478\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"327224\" paperTitle=\"(Mirshafiee et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> and transferrin <Paper corpusId=\"244897478\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Strategies to address this issue include optimizing the density and orientation of targeting ligands on the nanoparticle surface or using ligands that retain their functionality despite corona formation.\n\nFor directing nanoparticles away from the liver and toward other tissues like the spleen, researchers have developed selective organ targeting (SORT) approaches. These strategies involve designing nanoparticles with low ApoE content in their corona to avoid liver capture, while incorporating anionic lipids to recruit specific proteins like \u03b22-glycoprotein I (\u03b22-GPI) that promote uptake by macrophages in the spleen <Paper corpusId=\"271589862\" paperTitle=\"(Jain et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This demonstrates how manipulating corona composition through surface chemistry can be used to achieve specific organ targeting.\n\nMolecular imprinting techniques represent another emerging approach to control protein corona composition. By designing nanoparticle surfaces with specific functional groups and patterns, researchers can selectively attract beneficial proteins while minimizing the adsorption of opsonins. The distribution and number of surface hydroxyl groups, for example, can regulate how nanomaterials interact with various proteins, including albumin <Paper corpusId=\"252128570\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"203654456\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe use of ApoE decoration to enhance brain targeting represents a particularly promising strategy for crossing the blood-brain barrier. Lipid nanoparticles have been decorated by incubation with ApoE4 to enhance the accumulation of therapeutic agents in the brain, taking advantage of the high affinity between ApoE and specific receptors in the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"264370341\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach has proven effective in delivering therapeutic cargoes to the central nervous system, which remains one of the most challenging barriers for drug delivery.\n\nUnderstanding and controlling protein corona composition is essential for developing effective nanomedicines, as the corona significantly influences nanoparticles' blood circulation, clearance, biodistribution, and delivery efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"274288470\" paperTitle=\"(Tripathi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

SP-sLip absorb plasma apolipoproteins A1, E and J, consequently exposing receptor-binding domain of apolipoproteins to achieve brain-targeted delivery. Doxorubicin loaded SP-sLip (SP-sLip/DOX) show significant enhancement of brain distribution and anti-brain cancer effect in comparison to doxorubicin loaded plain liposomes. SP-sLip preserve functions of the absorbed human plasma ApoE, and the corona-mediated targeting strategy works in SP modified PLGA nanoparticles. The present study may pave a new avenue to facilitate clinical translation of targeted drug delivery systems. Plasma proteins may severely affect the in vivo performance of liposomes.
