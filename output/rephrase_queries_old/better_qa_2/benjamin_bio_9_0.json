In addition to simply staying on the endothelium surface to release the loaded drug, some nanocarriers can enter cells by endocytosis, a pathway that allows \"drug-trafficking\" (Khalil et al., 2006). This can occur via nonreceptor mediated or receptor-mediated mechanisms. One example of the non-receptor mediated endocytosis is macropinocytosis.

Macropinosomes resemble \"empty\" phagosomes and show no difference with the \"spacious phagosomes\" triggered by the enteropathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Shigella. Macropinosomes may fuse with lysosomes or regurgitate their content back to the extracellular space. In multiple cell types, macropinocytosis is a transient response to growth factors. When amoebas are cultured under axenic conditions, macropinocytosis is induced so as to fulfil nutritional requirements. In immature dendritic cells, macropinocytosis allows for extensive sampling of soluble antigens; after a few days of maturation, this activity vanishes as processed peptides are being presented. Macropinosomes are also formed at the leading edge of motile leukocytes or neurons. In all these examples, macropinocytosis appears tightly regulated. Transformation of fibroblasts by Src or Ras also results in constitutive formation of macropinosomes at \"ruffling\" zones, that could be related to accelerated cell motility. Like phagocytosis, macropinocytosis depends on signalling to the actin cytoskeleton. We have explored this signalling in transformed cells. v-Src and K-Ras activate PI3K and PLC, as demonstrated by in situ production of the corresponding lipid products. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and PLC and stable transfection leading to a dominant-negative PI3-kinase construct in transformed fibroblasts abolish macropinocytosis, demonstrating that both enzyme activities are essential. Conversely, stable transfection leading to a dominant-positive P13K in non-transformed fibroblasts is sufficient to induce macropinocytosis. Combination of experiments allows to conclude that P13K and PLC act in sequential order. In non-polarized cells expressing a thermosensitive v-Src mutant, v-Src kinase activation accelerates fluid-phase endocytosis. In polarized MDCK cells, this stimulation occurs selectively at the apical domain and the response is selectively abrogated by pharmacological inhibitors of P13K and PLC. Thus, two paradigmatic oncogenes cause constitutive macropinocytosis. For v-Src, this response is polarized at the apical membrane. It is suggested that, in enterocytes that do not normally phagocytose, the P13K-PLC signalling pathway leading to selective induction of macropinocytosis at the luminal surface has been subverted by enteropathogenic bacteria to penetrate via \"spacious phagosomes\"."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Lombardo et al., 2020)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 219332656, "title": "Key for crossing the BBB with nanoparticles: the rational design", "year": 2020, "venue": "Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology", "authors": [{"name": "S.

In addition to simply staying on the endothelium surface to release the loaded drug, some nanocarriers can enter cells by endocytosis, a pathway that allows \"drug-trafficking\" (Khalil et al., 2006). This can occur via nonreceptor mediated or receptor-mediated mechanisms. One example of the non-receptor mediated endocytosis is macropinocytosis.

Macropinosomes resemble \"empty\" phagosomes and show no difference with the \"spacious phagosomes\" triggered by the enteropathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Shigella. Macropinosomes may fuse with lysosomes or regurgitate their content back to the extracellular space. In multiple cell types, macropinocytosis is a transient response to growth factors. When amoebas are cultured under axenic conditions, macropinocytosis is induced so as to fulfil nutritional requirements. In immature dendritic cells, macropinocytosis allows for extensive sampling of soluble antigens; after a few days of maturation, this activity vanishes as processed peptides are being presented. Macropinosomes are also formed at the leading edge of motile leukocytes or neurons. In all these examples, macropinocytosis appears tightly regulated. Transformation of fibroblasts by Src or Ras also results in constitutive formation of macropinosomes at \"ruffling\" zones, that could be related to accelerated cell motility. Like phagocytosis, macropinocytosis depends on signalling to the actin cytoskeleton. We have explored this signalling in transformed cells. v-Src and K-Ras activate PI3K and PLC, as demonstrated by in situ production of the corresponding lipid products. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and PLC and stable transfection leading to a dominant-negative PI3-kinase construct in transformed fibroblasts abolish macropinocytosis, demonstrating that both enzyme activities are essential. Conversely, stable transfection leading to a dominant-positive P13K in non-transformed fibroblasts is sufficient to induce macropinocytosis. Combination of experiments allows to conclude that P13K and PLC act in sequential order. In non-polarized cells expressing a thermosensitive v-Src mutant, v-Src kinase activation accelerates fluid-phase endocytosis. In polarized MDCK cells, this stimulation occurs selectively at the apical domain and the response is selectively abrogated by pharmacological inhibitors of P13K and PLC. Thus, two paradigmatic oncogenes cause constitutive macropinocytosis. For v-Src, this response is polarized at the apical membrane. It is suggested that, in enterocytes that do not normally phagocytose, the P13K-PLC signalling pathway leading to selective induction of macropinocytosis at the luminal surface has been subverted by enteropathogenic bacteria to penetrate via \"spacious phagosomes\"."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Han et al., 2020)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 234394994, "title": "Evolution of blood\u2013brain barrier in brain diseases and related systemic nanoscale brain-targeting drug delivery strategies", "year": 2020, "venue": "Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B", "authors": [{"name": "Liang Han", "authorId": "2118502752"}, {"name": "Chen Jiang", "authorId": "145251736"}], "n_citations": 217}, "snippets": ["Due to the rapid expansion of nanotechnology, various types of nanocarriers have been developed, for example, liposomes, micelles and various nanoparticles (NPs, Fig. 8)", "For example, transferrin, lactoferrin, glucose, polysorbate 80 and anti-TfR antibodies have been developed as brain targeting ligands and have shown high Diseased BBB-based brain-targeting delivery strategies efficiency in amplifying BBB penetration and brain delivery of nanocarriers 41,103e110 ."], "score": 0.72802734375}, {"id": "(Liu et al._1, 2024)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 269512854, "title": "Advances in Nanotechnology for Enhancing the Solubility and Bioavailability of Poorly Soluble Drugs", "year": 2024, "venue": "Drug Design, Development and Therapy", "authors": [{"name": "Yifan Liu", "authorId": "2299489929"}, {"name": "Yushan Liang", "authorId": "2299496467"}, {"name": "Yuhong Jing", "authorId": "2300338676"}, {"name": "Peng Xin", "authorId": "2299370015"}, {"name": "Jia Li Han", "authorId": "2299485265"}, {"name": "Yongle Du", "authorId": "2299507198"}, {"name": "Xinru Yu", "authorId": "2299879807"}, {"name": "Runhe Zhu", "authorId": "2299449449"}, {"name": "Mingxun Zhang", "authorId": "2299515698"}, {"name": "Wen Chen", "authorId": "2330371953"}, {"name": "Yingjie Ma", "authorId": "2300076803"}], "n_citations": 45}, "snippets": ["For instance, nasal drug delivery systems utilizing materials such as liposomes and nanoemulsions, enhanced for mucosal penetration, can improve drug adherence and permeation through the nasal epithelial barrier, significantly enhancing mucosal diffusion and absorption, 93 thereby making nasal delivery more efficient as demonstrated in Figure 3A", "For example, Sun et al (Zhuo et al., 1999) developed butyl cyanoacrylate nanoparticles coated with Polysorbate-80, leveraging the surfactant's adsorption of apolipoproteins for tight binding with apolipoprotein receptors on the BBB.

Here, a sequential targeting in crosslinking (STICK) nanodelivery strategy is presented to circumvent these important physiological barriers to improve drug delivery to brain tumors. STICK nanoparticles (STICK\u2010NPs) can sequentially target BBB/BBTB and brain tumor cells with surface maltobionic acid (MA) and 4\u2010carboxyphenylboronic acid (CBA), respectively, and simultaneously enhance nanoparticle stability with pH\u2010responsive crosslinkages formed by MA and CBA in situ. STICK\u2010NPs exhibit prolonged circulation time (17\u2010fold higher area under curve) than the free agent, allowing increased opportunities to transpass the BBB/BBTB via glucose\u2010transporter\u2010mediated transcytosis by MA. The tumor acidic environment then triggers the transformation of the STICK\u2010NPs into smaller nanoparticles and reveals a secondary CBA targeting moiety for deep tumor penetration and enhanced uptake in tumor cells.

Macropinosomes resemble \"empty\" phagosomes and show no difference with the \"spacious phagosomes\" triggered by the enteropathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Shigella. Macropinosomes may fuse with lysosomes or regurgitate their content back to the extracellular space. In multiple cell types, macropinocytosis is a transient response to growth factors. When amoebas are cultured under axenic conditions, macropinocytosis is induced so as to fulfil nutritional requirements. In immature dendritic cells, macropinocytosis allows for extensive sampling of soluble antigens; after a few days of maturation, this activity vanishes as processed peptides are being presented. Macropinosomes are also formed at the leading edge of motile leukocytes or neurons. In all these examples, macropinocytosis appears tightly regulated. Transformation of fibroblasts by Src or Ras also results in constitutive formation of macropinosomes at \"ruffling\" zones, that could be related to accelerated cell motility. Like phagocytosis, macropinocytosis depends on signalling to the actin cytoskeleton. We have explored this signalling in transformed cells. v-Src and K-Ras activate PI3K and PLC, as demonstrated by in situ production of the corresponding lipid products. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and PLC and stable transfection leading to a dominant-negative PI3-kinase construct in transformed fibroblasts abolish macropinocytosis, demonstrating that both enzyme activities are essential. Conversely, stable transfection leading to a dominant-positive P13K in non-transformed fibroblasts is sufficient to induce macropinocytosis. Combination of experiments allows to conclude that P13K and PLC act in sequential order. In non-polarized cells expressing a thermosensitive v-Src mutant, v-Src kinase activation accelerates fluid-phase endocytosis. In polarized MDCK cells, this stimulation occurs selectively at the apical domain and the response is selectively abrogated by pharmacological inhibitors of P13K and PLC. Thus, two paradigmatic oncogenes cause constitutive macropinocytosis. For v-Src, this response is polarized at the apical membrane. It is suggested that, in enterocytes that do not normally phagocytose, the P13K-PLC signalling pathway leading to selective induction of macropinocytosis at the luminal surface has been subverted by enteropathogenic bacteria to penetrate via \"spacious phagosomes\"."], "score": 0.0}], "table": null}, {"title": "Exosomes and Bioinspired Carriers: Emerging Solutions", "tldr": "Exosomes and bioinspired carriers represent cutting-edge approaches for brain drug delivery with advantages including longer circulation time, enhanced biocompatibility, and natural targeting abilities.

We selected three sequences of CPPs [melittin, Kaposi fibroblast growth factor (kFGF), and penetration accelerating sequence\u2013R8] and compared their ability to internalize into the cells and, subsequently, improve the transfection efficiency.

Plaques of amyloid \u03b2 play a pivotal role in affecting cognitive functions and memory. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is one of the leading causes of dementia worldwide. Several treatment strategies focusing on the amyloid cascade have been implemented to treat AD. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses the main obstructive barrier by refraining drugs from penetrating the brain. Nanotechnology is a promising research field for brain drug delivery using nanosized particles. Zebrafish is emerging as a model of interest to elaborate on brain targeting and nanotechnology-based therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. In the current study, we have synthesized and characterized chrysin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (Chr-Chi NPs) and evaluated them for neuroprotection against amyloid-\u03b2-induced toxicity. We find that treatment with Chr-Chi NPs helps to retain memory, cognition, and synaptic connections, which are otherwise compromised due to A\u03b21-42 toxicity.

The albumin-binding proteins (e.g., SPARC and gp60) are overexpressed in many tumors for transport of albumin as an amino acid and an energy source for fast-growing cancer cells. However, their application in brain delivery has rarely been investigated. In this work, SPARC and gp60 overexpression was found on glioma and tumor vessel endothelium; therefore, such pathways were explored for use in brain-targeting biomimetic delivery. We developed a green method for blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating albumin nanoparticle synthesis, with the capacity to coencapsulate different drugs and no need for cross-linkers. The hydrophobic drugs (i.e., paclitaxel and fenretinide) yield synergistic effects to induce albumin self-assembly, forming dual drug-loaded nanoparticles. The albumin nanoparticles can penetrate the BBB and target glioma cells via the mechanisms of SPARC- and gp60-mediated biomimetic transport. Importantly, by modification with the cell-penetrating peptide LMWP, the albumin nanoparticles display enhanced BBB penetration, intratumoral infiltration, and cellular uptake. The LMWP-modified nanoparticles exhibited improved treatment outcomes in both subcutaneous and intracranial glioma models, with reduced toxic side effects. The therapeutic mechanisms were associated with induction of apoptosis, antiangiogenesis, and tumor immune microenvironment regulation.

Despite the discovery of many potential molecules, HD therapy is still limited to symptomatic relief. Among these molecules, few mechanism based peptide inhibitors of polyglutamine aggregation (QBP1, NT17 and PGQ9P2) have shown promising activity; however, poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, low bioavailability, and low half-life may hinder their therapeutic potential. Hence, to deliver them to the brain for assessing their efficacy, we have designed and synthesized peptide loaded poly-d,l-lactide- co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles of less than 200 nm in size by carbodiimide chemistry and nanoprecipitation protocols. For brain delivery, PLGA nanoparticles were coated with polysorbate 80 which aids receptor mediated internalization. Using the in vitro BBB model of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and healthy mice, the translocation of polysorbate 80 coated fluorescent nanoparticles was confirmed. Moreover, QBP1, NT17, and PGQ9P2 loaded PLGA nanoparticles showed dose dependent inhibition of polyglutamine aggregation in cell models of HD (Neuro 2A and PC12 cells) and improved motor performance in Drosophila model of HD. Additionally, no toxicity in cells and animals confirmed biocompatibility of the nanoparticulate formulations.

Harnessing the possibility of delivering neuroactive drugs by way of receptors already present on the brain endothelium has been of interest for many years. The transferrin receptor is of special interest since its expression is limited to the endothelium of the brain as opposed to peripheral endothelium. Here, we investigate the possibility of delivering immunoliposomes and their encapsulated cargo to the brain via targeting of the transferrin receptor. We find that transferrin receptor-targeting increases the association between the immunoliposomes and primary endothelial cells in vitro, but that this does not correlate with increased cargo transcytosis. Furthermore, we show that the transferrin receptor-targeted immunoliposomes accumulate along the microvessels of the brains of rats, but find no evidence for transcytosis of the immunoliposome. Conversely, the increased accumulation correlated both with increased cargo uptake in the brain endothelium and subsequent cargo transport into the brain. These findings suggest that transferrin receptor-targeting is a relevant strategy of increasing drug exposure to the brain."], "score": 0.0}], "table": null}], "cost": 0.500706}}
