Advances in protein engineering and materials science have contributed to novel nanoscale targeting approaches that may bring new hope to cancer patients. Several therapeutic nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use. However, to date, there are only a few clinically approved nanocarriers that incorporate molecules to selectively bind and target cancer cells. This review examines some of the approved formulations and discusses the challenges in translating basic research to the clinic. We detail the arsenal of nanocarriers and molecules available for selective tumour targeting, and emphasize the challenges in cancer treatment. Cancer remains one of the world's most devastating diseases, with more than 10 million new cases every year 1. However, mortality has decreased in the past two years 2 owing to better understanding of tumour biology and improved diagnostic devices and treatments. Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, which often also kill healthy cells and cause toxicity to the patient. It would therefore be desirable to develop chemotherapeutics that can either passively or actively target cancerous cells. Passive targeting exploits the characteristic features of tumour biology that allow nanocarriers to accumulate in the tumour by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect 2. Passively targeting nanocarriers first reached clinical trials in the mid-1980s, and the first products, based on liposomes and polymer\u2013protein conjugates, were marketed in the mid-1990s. Later, therapeutic nanocarriers based on this strategy were approved for wider use (Table 1) and methods of further enhancing targeting of drugs to cancer cells were investigated. Active approaches achieve this by conjugating nanocarriers containing chemotherapeutics with molecules that bind to overexpressed antigens or receptors on the target cells. Recent reviews provide perspective on the use of nanotechnology as a fundamental tool in cancer research and nanomedicine 3,4. Here we focus on the potential of nanocarriers and molecules that can selectively target tumours, and highlight the challenges in translating some of the basic research to the clinic.

As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites (Iyer et al., 2006); on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs (Nakamura et al., 2016). While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans (Danhier, 2016). For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39]."], "score": 0.95166015625}, {"id": "(Nakamura et al., 2016)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 20466264, "title": "Nanodrug Delivery: Is the Enhanced Permeability and Retention Effect Sufficient for Curing Cancer?", "year": 2016, "venue": "Bioconjugate chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "Yuko Nakamura", "authorId": "17139744"}, {"name": "A.

As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites (Iyer et al., 2006); on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs (Nakamura et al., 2016). While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans (Danhier, 2016). For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39]."], "score": 0.95166015625}, {"id": "(Nakamura et al., 2016)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 20466264, "title": "Nanodrug Delivery: Is the Enhanced Permeability and Retention Effect Sufficient for Curing Cancer?", "year": 2016, "venue": "Bioconjugate chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "Yuko Nakamura", "authorId": "17139744"}, {"name": "A.
