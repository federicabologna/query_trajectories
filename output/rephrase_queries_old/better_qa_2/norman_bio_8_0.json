The reverse vaccinology approach significantly reduces the time required for antigen identification by utilizing genomic information to directly design and produce protective antigens using recombinant technology <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This systematic approach enables identification of potential antigens even from pathogens that are difficult or impossible to culture, expanding the range of diseases that can be targeted through vaccination <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, subunit vaccines developed through recombinant antibody technology offer superior safety profiles compared to traditional whole-pathogen vaccines. These vaccines can be manufactured with minimal risk of contamination and eliminate the need for handling dangerous live pathogens during production <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. When formulated with appropriate adjuvants, subunit vaccines can focus the immune response on protective or highly conserved antigenic determinants that may not naturally elicit potent responses during infection or after vaccination with inactivated or attenuated pathogens <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite these advantages, recombinant antibody technology has notable limitations. The approach is restricted to identifying protein or glycoprotein antigens, omitting other important vaccine components such as polysaccharides and glycolipids <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, a significant challenge in reverse vaccinology remains the identification of protective antigens that will induce effective immunity against the targeted pathogen <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. While computational methods can predict potential antigens, extensive experimental validation is still required to confirm their protective efficacy <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nNevertheless, once protective antigens are successfully identified, this approach enables scientists to systematically classify such antigens and develop efficient preparations against virtually any pathogen whose genome has been sequenced <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Of course, this approach is limited to identifi cation of protein or glycoprotein antigens, omitting such important vaccine components such as polysaccharides and glycolipids. The principal question for reverse vaccinology consists in identifi cation of protective antigen, which presents the main hurdle of this approach.
