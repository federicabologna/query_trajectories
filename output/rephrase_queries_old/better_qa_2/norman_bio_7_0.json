These therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing segments of the biopharmaceutical industry, with applications ranging from cancer treatment to autoimmune diseases. The manufacturing process can be divided into two main phases: upstream processing and downstream processing.\n\nUpstream processing encompasses cell line development, cell culture expansion, and production phases where the engineered cells express the target antibody. This typically involves growing cells in bioreactors under carefully controlled conditions (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrient availability) to maximize antibody yield and quality. Traditional batch or fed-batch culture methods are common, though perfusion systems are gaining popularity for their increased productivity.\n\nDownstream processing involves the separation and purification of the antibody from the cell culture fluid through multiple steps including clarification (removal of cells and debris), capture chromatography (typically using Protein A affinity), viral inactivation/removal, polishing chromatography steps, and final formulation. This purification train aims to achieve high purity (>99%) while maintaining the structural integrity and biological activity of the antibody.\n\nAs the demand for therapeutic antibodies continues to grow, manufacturers face increasing pressure to develop more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable production methods while maintaining strict quality standards and regulatory compliance.

(7 sources)", "text": "\nThe evolution of upstream processing capabilities has created a significant shift in production bottlenecks toward downstream operations. As upstream titers have increased approximately five-fold in recent years, the purification processes have struggled to keep pace, resulting in downstream operations becoming the primary constraint in antibody manufacturing <Paper corpusId=\"263249943\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This imbalance has shifted manufacturing costs toward downstream processing, creating economic pressure for innovation in purification technologies <Paper corpusId=\"256230774\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe most significant downstream bottleneck is the initial capture step, which traditionally relies on Protein A affinity chromatography. This critical operation suffers from inherent limitations in productivity due to the diffusion-limited nature of conventional resins. As Grunberg et al. note, \"Protein A resins are diffusion-limited chromatography materials which require low flow rates to achieve a binding capacity above 30 g L\u22121 with the result of low productivity\" <Paper corpusId=\"250226952\" paperTitle=\"(Grunberg et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The increased upstream titers have brought a corresponding increase in host cell proteins (HCPs) and other contaminants that must be removed to ensure product safety and quality <Paper corpusId=\"256230774\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This heightened impurity burden challenges traditional purification approaches and necessitates more robust and efficient separation methods.\n\nAnother significant challenge is managing variability in the feed stream. Downstream processes must contend with inherent variability in the composition of the harvested cell culture fluid, which stems from biological variations in the upstream production system.

In the future, the large-scale production of recombinant antibodies and development of culture processes will develop rapidly in the direction of stabilizing production capacity and improving quality.

This paper presents a theoretical and practical approach for designing a periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC) operation as a continuous capture purification step that is integrated with a perfusion cell culture process. The constraints for continuous and optimal PCC operation govern the selection of residence time and number of columns. The flexibility available in PCC design for selection of these parameters is dictated by the binding characteristics of the target protein on the capture resin. Using an empirical model for the protein breakthrough curve, analytical solutions to determine these conditions were derived and verified with experimental results for three different proteins: two relatively unstable proteins (recombinant enzymes) and a relatively stable protein (monoclonal antibody). The advantages of a continuous downstream capture step are highlighted for the three case studies in comparison with the existing batch chromatography processes. The use of PCC leads to improvements in process economics due to higher resin capacity utilization and correspondingly lower buffer consumption. Furthermore, integrated and continuous bioprocessing results in a smaller facility footprint by elimination of harvest hold vessels and clarification, as well as by reducing the capture column size by one to two orders of magnitude."], "score": 0.0}], "table": null}], "cost": 0.404076}}
