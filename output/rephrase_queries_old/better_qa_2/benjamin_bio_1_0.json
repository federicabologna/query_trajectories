These systems typically range in size from 1-1000 nm and can be broadly categorized into three main types: lipid-based, polymeric, and inorganic nanoparticles. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, and other lipid components that form bilayer structures capable of encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Polymeric nanoparticles utilize natural or synthetic polymers such as PLGA, PLA, chitosan, or alginate to create biodegradable carriers. Inorganic nanoparticles include metal-based structures (gold, silver), silica nanoparticles, quantum dots, and carbon-based nanomaterials. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nEach nanoparticle type offers distinct advantages for drug delivery. LNPs excel in biocompatibility and can efficiently deliver nucleic acid therapeutics, as demonstrated by their use in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Polymeric nanoparticles provide sustained drug release profiles and tunable degradation rates. Inorganic nanoparticles often feature unique physical properties that enable additional functionalities such as imaging capabilities or photothermal effects.

Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals.

A primary concern is the potential for certain lipid formulations to trigger immune responses or accumulate in organs such as the liver and spleen, which could lead to toxicity in specific contexts <Paper corpusId=\"275299864\" paperTitle=\"(Sousa et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Even with advances in LNP development, including the introduction of ionizable lipids with optimized properties to enhance endosomal release and minimize cytotoxicity, challenges regarding immune activation and off-target effects persist <Paper corpusId=\"275299864\" paperTitle=\"(Sousa et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe scalability of production processes represents another significant hurdle for all nanoparticle types. Manufacturing challenges can affect batch-to-batch reproducibility, potentially compromising safety profiles when transitioning from laboratory to industrial production <Paper corpusId=\"272340496\" paperTitle=\"(Giordano et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This issue is particularly relevant for complex formulations like lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles, where the development of consistent, scalable manufacturing protocols remains an ongoing challenge <Paper corpusId=\"234309593\" paperTitle=\"(Chouhan et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRegulatory approval pathways present additional complexities in safety assessment. Despite progress with reliable GRAS-regulated lipids, cGMP-grade manufacturing processes, and comprehensive preclinical ADME and toxicity data <Paper corpusId=\"252145310\" paperTitle=\"(Chaudhuri et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>, regulatory bodies still require extensive safety documentation that can vary across different jurisdictions. For inorganic nanoparticles specifically, a notable lack of comprehensive toxicological assessment in the literature further complicates their clinical translation <Paper corpusId=\"254342017\" paperTitle=\"(Pontes et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nLong-term safety evaluation remains perhaps the most critical challenge across all nanoparticle types. The need for more comprehensive in vivo studies to fully understand the chronic effects of repeated administration is widely acknowledged <Paper corpusId=\"272340496\" paperTitle=\"(Giordano et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This is particularly important for polymeric nanoparticles, where concerns about incomplete degradation in vivo and immunogenic potential require ongoing research to ensure safety and biocompatibility <Paper corpusId=\"275299864\" paperTitle=\"(Sousa et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFuture advances in nanoparticle safety assessment will likely focus on developing standardized testing protocols that can evaluate biocompatibility across different biological systems. For polymeric nanoparticles, research is increasingly directed toward using biocompatible and biodegradable polymers such as PLGA, chitosan, or gelatin to mitigate potential toxicity concerns <Paper corpusId=\"272766688\" paperTitle=\"(Vasukutty et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, inorganic nanoparticles are being carefully designed with consideration for composition and surface properties to minimize potential toxicity and interactions with the immune system <Paper corpusId=\"272766688\" paperTitle=\"(Vasukutty et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite these challenges, the inherent biocompatibility of lipid-based systems, which mimic the structure of biological membranes, continues to position them favorably in the safety landscape <Paper corpusId=\"267053919\" paperTitle=\"(Trucillo, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

These systems offer controlled release profiles and high loading capacities. Innovations such as functionalized polymers with tumor-specific ligands (e.g., folic acid or RGD peptides) have enhanced selective tumor uptake.
