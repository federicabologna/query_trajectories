Assessing the integrity of mRNA payloads within these complex delivery systems presents unique analytical challenges. The fragile nature of RNA molecules makes them susceptible to degradation by ubiquitous ribonucleases (RNases), mechanical stress, and chemical factors during sample preparation and analysis.\n\nEffective analytical techniques must balance the need for detailed characterization with minimal sample perturbation. The enclosed mRNA must be released from the LNP structure for many analyses, yet this process itself can compromise payload integrity. Additionally, the heterogeneous nature of LNP formulations adds complexity to analytical method development. Size, charge, encapsulation efficiency, and sequence integrity all represent critical quality attributes that require assessment.\n\nTraditional analytical approaches have been adapted and new methods developed specifically for mRNA-LNP formulations. These techniques must distinguish between intact and degraded mRNA species while providing information about LNP physical characteristics. The field continues to evolve toward methods that reduce sample manipulation, provide higher resolution, and enable more accurate quantification of intact versus degraded RNA species. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">", "citations": [], "table": null}, {"title": "Chromatography-Based Techniques", "tldr": "Chromatography techniques, particularly ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RPLC), are fundamental for assessing mRNA integrity within LNPs.

The separation of fragments with different sizes is based on hydrophobic interaction with the column material. UV detection at 260 nm is employed, as the aforementioned size restrictions preclude the use of MS detection. The IP-RPLC-UV method needs to be optimized to detect the main degradation products, i.e. the shorter fragments, to ensure the method is stability-indicating.\n\nCapillary electrophoresis is an orthogonal method to IP-RPLC-UV, where the separation is based on size. The separation medium is a low viscosity \"separation gel\", consisting of polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and additives, typically glycerol, as viscosity enhancers. 49,77,78 The polymers form a three-dimensional network that allows the separation based on size. Larger molecules tangle up in the polymer network to a greater extent than smaller fragments and thus migrate slower during the electrophoresis process. The quantification of the fragments and intact mRNA can be either by UV at 260 nm or fluorescence detection", ".For the RNA quantification in LNPs, the Quant-it RiboGreen reagent (Thermofisher) characterization is widely used, because it can differentiate between RNA inside and outside the LNP to calculate a percentage encapsulated RNA, which is not straightforward with other methods. 82"], "score": 0.87744140625}, {"id": "(Kanavarioti, 2019)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 59526403, "title": "HPLC methods for purity evaluation of man-made single-stranded RNAs", "year": 2019, "venue": "Scientific Reports", "authors": [{"name": "A.
