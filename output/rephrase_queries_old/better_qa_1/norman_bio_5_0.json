Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology enabled the sequencing of whole T-cell receptors (TCRs) and B-cell receptors (BCRs)/immunoglobulins (Igs) in the tumor microenvironment. Since BCRs/Igs in tumor tissues have high affinities for tumor-specific antigens, the patterns of their amino acid sequences and other sequence-independent features such as the number of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) may differ between the normal and tumor microenvironments. However, given the high diversity of BCRs/Igs and the rarity of recurrent sequences among individuals, it is far more difficult to capture such differences in BCR/Ig sequences than in TCR sequences. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of discriminating BCRs/Igs in tumor and in normal tissues, by capturing these differences using supervised machine learning methods applied to RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs. RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs were obtained from matched normal and tumor specimens from 90 gastric cancer patients. BCR/Ig-features obtained in Rep-Seq were used to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. Different machine learning models using various features were constructed as well as gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifier combining these models. The results demonstrated that BCR/Ig sequences between normal and tumor microenvironments exhibit their differences. Next, by using a GBM trained to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences, we tried to classify sets of BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. As a result, an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.826 was achieved, suggesting that BCR/Ig repertoires have distinct sequence-level features in normal and tumor tissues.

In this study, using long read sequencing, we sequenced four Indian-origin rhesus macaque tissues and obtained high-quality, full-length sequences for over 6000 unique Ig and TCR transcripts, without the need for sequence assembly. We constructed, to our knowledge, the first complete reference set for the constant regions of all known isotypes and chain types of rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires.

(Glanville et al., 2015) Fully sequencing both chains is particularly valuable. Indeed, while the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are known to play a significant role in binding, (Akbar et al., 2019) with the third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) being crucial for antibody specificity, (Xu et al., 2000) evidence suggests that other regions also contribute to binding.

Here, we show that many different HCDR3s can be identified within a target-specific antibody population after in vitro selection. For each identified HCDR3, a number of different antibodies bearing differences elsewhere can be found. In such selected populations, all antibodies with the same HCDR3 recognize the target, albeit at different affinities. In contrast, within unselected populations, the majority of antibodies with the same HCDR3 sequence do not bind the target. In one HCDR3 examined in depth, all target-specific antibodies were derived from the same VDJ rearrangement, while non-binding antibodies with the same HCDR3 were derived from many different V and D gene rearrangements. Careful examination of previously published in vivo datasets reveals that HCDR3s shared between, and within, different individuals can also originate from rearrangements of different V and D genes, with up to 26 different rearrangements yielding the same identical HCDR3 sequence. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the same HCDR3 can be generated by many different rearrangements, but that specific target binding is an outcome of unique rearrangements and VL pairing: the HCDR3 is necessary, albeit insufficient, for specific antibody binding."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Guloglu et al., 2023)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 258788132, "title": "Specific attributes of the VL domain influence both the structure and structural variability of CDR-H3 through steric effects", "year": 2023, "venue": "bioRxiv", "authors": [{"name": "Bora Guloglu", "authorId": "2166683294"}, {"name": "C.
