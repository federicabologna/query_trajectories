{"reformulated1": "How does the choice and diversification strategy of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), particularly CDR-H3 and CDR-L3, influence the functional diversity and therapeutic potential of antibodies discovered via phage display?", "reformulated2": "What are the specific technical challenges and solutions in achieving high transformation efficiency and minimizing amplification bias during the construction and selection phases of large, diverse phage display antibody libraries?", "reformulated3": "In the context of phage display, how do natural, synthetic, and semi-synthetic library sources compare in their impact on developability, stability, and specificity of selected therapeutic antibodies?"}
