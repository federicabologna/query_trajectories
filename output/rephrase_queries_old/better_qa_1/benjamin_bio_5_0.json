(LLM Memory)", "text": "\nAntibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) represent a sophisticated class of biopharmaceuticals designed to deliver potent cytotoxic agents specifically to cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. The fundamental components of an ADC include: a monoclonal antibody that targets a tumor-associated antigen, a cytotoxic payload that induces cell death, and a linker that connects these two components. The linker chemistry is a critical design element that determines how and when the cytotoxic payload is released from the antibody.\n\nLinkers in ADCs are broadly classified into two major categories: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers are designed to release the cytotoxic payload in response to specific conditions found predominantly in or around tumor cells, such as acidic pH (hydrazone linkers), reducing environments (disulfide linkers), or the presence of specific enzymes like cathepsins (peptide linkers). In contrast, non-cleavable linkers (such as thioether bonds) remain intact even after internalization, requiring complete degradation of the antibody within lysosomes to release the active drug, typically with an amino acid residue still attached to the payload.\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers has profound implications for the ADC's pharmacokinetic profile, systemic toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy. This selection influences the stability of the ADC in circulation, the mechanism of drug release, the potential for bystander effects, and ultimately the therapeutic window of the drug. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">", "citations": [], "table": null}, {"title": "Mechanism of Action: Cleavable versus Non-Cleavable Linkers", "tldr": "Cleavable linkers release their payloads through specific physiological mechanisms such as pH changes, reducing environments, or enzymatic activity, while non-cleavable linkers require complete antibody degradation within lysosomes.

These linkers can be categorized by their release mechanisms:\n\n1. **Hydrazone linkers**: Stable in the alkaline environment of the bloodstream but hydrolyzed in the acidic environment (low pH) of endosomes and lysosomes. However, they may occasionally hydrolyze prematurely in plasma, leading to systemic toxicity. <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> The hydrazone linker in gemtuzumab ozogamicin, for example, exhibits less stability than other cleavable linkers, which may contribute to its narrow therapeutic window. <Paper corpusId=\"211564536\" paperTitle=\"(Shim, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n2. **Disulfide linkers**: These exploit the elevated levels of reductive glutathione in cancer cells to cleave the disulfide bond, releasing the active payload. <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> Recent studies have identified that thioredoxin (TRX) and glutaredoxin (GRX) enzymes catalyze the cleavage of disulfide bonds in ADC linkers. <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"155090407\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n3. **Peptide linkers**: These contain specific amino acid sequences that are substrates for lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B. The valine-citrulline peptide linker found in brentuximab vedotin is cleaved by proteases in the host cells. <Paper corpusId=\"20997961\" paperTitle=\"(Vasigala, 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"12190222\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAfter cleavage, many linker systems incorporate a self-immolative reaction that completely removes the linker fragment, releasing the free cytotoxic drug. <Paper corpusId=\"211564536\" paperTitle=\"(Shim, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195879565\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n## Non-Cleavable Linkers\n\nNon-cleavable linkers, such as thioether bonds (MCC) and maleimidocaproyl (MC) linkers, operate through a distinctly different mechanism:\n\n1. **Antibody degradation**: These linkers require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody portion of the ADC to release the active drug. <Paper corpusId=\"17278582\" paperTitle=\"(Donaghy, 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"20997961\" paperTitle=\"(Vasigala, 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n2. **Drug-linker complex**: Rather than releasing the free drug, non-cleavable linkers produce a metabolite consisting of the cytotoxic payload still attached to the linker and an amino acid residue (typically lysine or cysteine) from the antibody. <Paper corpusId=\"17278582\" paperTitle=\"(Donaghy, 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10886659\" paperTitle=\"(Erickson et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n3. **Intracellular retention**: The charged amino acid residue attached to the drug-linker complex typically prevents diffusion through cell membranes, confining the cytotoxic effect to target cells that have internalized the ADC. <Paper corpusId=\"22673423\" paperTitle=\"(Govindan et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n## Comparative Mechanisms and Implications\n\nThe different release mechanisms of cleavable versus non-cleavable linkers have important consequences for ADC performance:\n\n1. **Bystander effect**: Cleavable linkers often produce freely diffusible drug molecules that can penetrate nearby cells, creating a \"bystander effect\" that can kill neighboring antigen-negative tumor cells. <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper> This effect is beneficial in tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression.\n\n2. **Target specificity**: Non-cleavable linkers tend to confine the cytotoxic effect to cells that have internalized the ADC, resulting in greater specificity but potentially reduced efficacy in heterogeneous tumors. <Paper corpusId=\"22673423\" paperTitle=\"(Govindan et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n3. **Systemic exposure**: Due to their mechanisms, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers generally demonstrate higher plasma stability, resulting in reduced systemic exposure to free cytotoxic drugs and potentially lower off-target toxicity. <Paper corpusId=\"251541751\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"266003384\" paperTitle=\"(Aggarwal et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n4. **Processing requirements**: Both linker types require different intracellular processing conditions to be effective. Non-cleavable linkers rely heavily on efficient lysosomal processing, while cleavable linkers can activate in various cellular compartments depending on their specific trigger mechanism. <Paper corpusId=\"405679\" paperTitle=\"(Dorywalska et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe selection between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers thus represents a critical design decision that must balance considerations of plasma stability, drug release kinetics, bystander effects, and target cell specificity based on the specific tumor characteristics and therapeutic goals. <Paper corpusId=\"260262995\" paperTitle=\"(Hurwitz et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"207609992\" paperTitle=\"(Phillips et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>", "citations": [{"id": "(Gogia et al., 2023)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 260408796, "title": "Antibody\u2013Drug Conjugates: A Review of Approved Drugs and Their Clinical Level of Evidence", "year": 2023, "venue": "Cancers", "authors": [{"name": "Pooja Gogia", "authorId": "1825753387"}, {"name": "Hamza Ashraf", "authorId": "79544447"}, {"name": "Sidharth Bhasin", "authorId": "32907042"}, {"name": "Yiqing Xu", "authorId": "48615260"}], "n_citations": 80}, "snippets": ["The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile.

Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019)", "ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload.

Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity.

In a comprehensive study by Polson et al., ADCs constructed with non-cleavable linkers (SMCC) showed significantly less weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities in animal models compared to those with cleavable linkers (SPP) at equivalent doses <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis difference in toxicity profiles can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Drug release mechanisms**: Cleavable linkers may release free cytotoxic drugs or toxic metabolites into circulation, while non-cleavable linkers require complete antibody degradation within lysosomes <Paper corpusId=\"13406561\" paperTitle=\"(Wan, 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Metabolite characteristics**: The cytotoxic metabolites released from ADCs with non-cleavable linkers typically retain amino acid residues from the antibody, which can reduce their membrane permeability and confine their activity to target cells <Paper corpusId=\"251660861\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"17277508\" paperTitle=\"(Diamantis et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Linker processing requirements**: Non-cleavable linkers depend on the complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody after internalization, a process that primarily occurs in target cells <Paper corpusId=\"235240827\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmood, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"22057001\" paperTitle=\"(Tsuchikama et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Impact on Therapeutic Window\n\nThe enhanced plasma stability and reduced systemic toxicity of non-cleavable linkers potentially translate to an improved therapeutic window for ADCs <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21541286\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. This advantage has been observed in multiple studies where ADCs with non-cleavable linkers were tolerated at significantly higher doses than their cleavable counterparts while maintaining similar efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"21541286\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, this improved safety profile comes with potential trade-offs.

An analysis of Phase I study data conducted by the FDA revealed that ADCs utilizing the same linker but targeting distinct antigens exhibited similar toxicity profiles, highlighting the critical importance of linker selection in ADC development <Paper corpusId=\"4678281\" paperTitle=\"(Mehrling et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"392811\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers therefore represents a crucial design decision that must balance considerations of plasma stability, systemic toxicity, and efficacy based on tumor characteristics and therapeutic goals.

In addition, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, with cleavable linkers being those that are cleaved from the active component of the ADC by any of a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones), protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide), and thiol-disulphide exchange reactions (disulphide), most of which occur in the endosomes of lysosomal compartments (Mccombs et al., 2015). In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as maleimidocaproyl and thioether linkers, require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the targeting antibody to occur, leaving the active component attached to the linker and a charged lysine or cysteine residue (Mccombs et al., 2015). Importantly, an analysis of Phase I study data for several ADCs in development that was conducted by the FDA noted that ADCs utilising the same linker, but distinct target antigens, exhibited similar toxicity profiles, highlighting the importance of linker selection in agent development (Drake et al., 2015)(Kim et al., 2015)."], "score": 0.94970703125}, {"id": "(Kim et al., 2015)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 392811, "title": "Strategies and Advancement in Antibody-Drug Conjugate Optimization for Targeted Cancer Therapeutics", "year": 2015, "venue": "Biomolecules & Therapeutics", "authors": [{"name": "Eunhee Kim", "authorId": "1770612"}, {"name": "Kristine M Kim", "authorId": "49350790"}], "n_citations": 140}, "snippets": ["Antibody-drug conjugates utilize the antibody as a delivery vehicle for highly potent cytotoxic molecules with specificity for tumor-associated antigens for cancer therapy.

(15 sources)", "text": "\nThe efficacy of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is directly influenced by the choice of linker chemistry, with cleavable and non-cleavable linkers offering distinct advantages and limitations for drug delivery to tumor cells.\n\n## Linker-Dependent Efficacy Across Targets\n\nIn a comprehensive study by Polson et al., ADCs with cleavable linkers demonstrated efficacy against a wide range of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma targets (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180), while ADCs with non-cleavable linkers showed efficacy against only two specific targets: CD22 and CD79b <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that the choice of linker technology should be tailored to the specific target antigen being pursued.\n\nThe more selective efficacy profile of non-cleavable linkers appears to be related to their mechanism of action, which requires:\n\n1. **Efficient internalization**: Non-cleavable linkers depend on cellular internalization of the ADC-antigen complex through endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"249748294\" paperTitle=\"(Lam et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Complete antibody degradation**: For ADCs with non-cleavable linkers to be effective, they must undergo complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation to release the active payload <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21359935\" paperTitle=\"(Monteiro et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Target-specific processing**: The lysine-drug-linker metabolites produced after degradation of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers remain charged and generally cannot diffuse through cell membranes, limiting their activity to cells that have internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"22673423\" paperTitle=\"(Govindan et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Case Studies in Comparative Efficacy\n\nDespite their more selective target profile, non-cleavable linkers have demonstrated superior efficacy in several comparative studies:\n\n1. **Trastuzumab-DM1**: The development of trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a non-cleavable thioether linkage (SMCC) showed superior activity compared to unconjugated trastuzumab or trastuzumab linked to maytansinoids through disulfide linkers <Paper corpusId=\"207609992\" paperTitle=\"(Phillips et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>. This observation contributed to the selection of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (T-DM1) for clinical development.\n\n2. **Auristatin derivatives**: Doronina et al. demonstrated that anti-CD30 ADCs with non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) linkers connecting to the cytotoxic payload MMAF were approximately as potent in vitro as their cleavable counterparts but were tolerated at more than three times the maximum tolerated dose <Paper corpusId=\"21541286\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Mechanisms Underlying Efficacy Differences\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the efficacy differences between ADCs with cleavable versus non-cleavable linkers:\n\n1. **Release kinetics**: ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate faster rates of cytotoxic drug activation and release for most cell lines <Paper corpusId=\"4592961\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This more rapid drug release may contribute to their broader efficacy profile across different target antigens.\n\n2. **Intracellular processing requirements**: Non-cleavable linkers have more stringent requirements for intracellular processing, including efficient internalization and lysosomal degradation <Paper corpusId=\"266003383\" paperTitle=\"(Wittwer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This dependency on specific cellular mechanisms may explain their efficacy against only certain antigens.\n\n3. **Plasma stability**: The greater plasma stability of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers allows more intact ADC molecules to reach tumor cells, potentially enhancing their efficacy for appropriate targets <Paper corpusId=\"235229014\" paperTitle=\"(Baah et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Bystander Effect and Efficacy in Heterogeneous Tumors\n\nA critical distinction between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers is their ability to generate bystander effects, which can significantly impact efficacy in heterogeneous tumors:\n\n1. **Cleavable linkers**: The free drugs released from ADCs with cleavable linkers can often diffuse through cell membranes to kill neighboring antigen-negative tumor cells, creating a beneficial bystander effect in heterogeneous tumors <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"266003383\" paperTitle=\"(Wittwer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"24698174\" paperTitle=\"(Staudacher et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Non-cleavable linkers**: The charged metabolites produced from ADCs with non-cleavable linkers typically cannot diffuse through cell membranes, limiting their activity to cells that have directly internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"22673423\" paperTitle=\"(Govindan et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. This may reduce their efficacy in tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression.\n\n3. **Target specificity**: The confined activity of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers provides greater target specificity but potentially reduced efficacy in heterogeneous tumors <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Therapeutic Window Considerations\n\nDespite potentially narrower efficacy profiles, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers often provide an improved therapeutic window:\n\n1. **Reduced toxicity**: The decreased systemic release of free cytotoxic drug from ADCs with non-cleavable linkers contributes to their reduced toxicity profile <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Tolerability at higher doses**: The improved tolerability of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may allow for administration at higher doses, potentially compensating for their more selective efficacy profile <Paper corpusId=\"21541286\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Enhanced therapeutic index**: The combination of targeted efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity may translate to an improved therapeutic index for ADCs with non-cleavable linkers against appropriate targets <Paper corpusId=\"276971806\" paperTitle=\"(Buyukgolcigezli et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246783968\" paperTitle=\"(Sheyi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers for optimal efficacy thus depends on multiple factors, including target antigen characteristics, tumor heterogeneity, internalization efficiency, and the desired balance between efficacy and safety.

This mechanism is particularly valuable in tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression, where not all cancer cells express the target antigen <Paper corpusId=\"266003383\" paperTitle=\"(Wittwer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Non-cleavable linkers**: These linkers require complete antibody degradation within lysosomes, resulting in charged metabolites (typically drug-linker complexes with an attached amino acid) that cannot easily cross cell membranes <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Consequently, their cytotoxic effects remain confined to cells that have directly internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"274892504\" paperTitle=\"(Tang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe bystander effect can occur through multiple pathways:\n\n1. **Intracellular release and diffusion**: The conventional understanding involves internalization of the ADC, intracellular linker cleavage, and subsequent diffusion of the released drug to neighboring cells <Paper corpusId=\"24698174\" paperTitle=\"(Staudacher et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Extracellular processing**: Recent evidence suggests that ADCs with certain cleavable linkers can be processed extracellularly, releasing the cytotoxic payload before cell internalization, which also contributes to bystander killing <Paper corpusId=\"24698174\" paperTitle=\"(Staudacher et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Impact on Tumor Heterogeneity\n\nThe bystander effect has significant implications for addressing tumor heterogeneity:\n\n1. **Heterogeneous antigen expression**: Most solid tumors display heterogeneous antigen expression <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Cleavable linkers that enable bystander effects can overcome this limitation by killing antigen-negative tumor cells in proximity to antigen-positive cells <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Tumor penetration barriers**: Physical barriers within tumors can limit ADC penetration. The bystander effect allows cytotoxic payloads to reach tumor regions that might be inaccessible to the intact ADC <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\n3. **Empirical evidence**: In vivo studies have demonstrated that ADCs with cleavable linkers can effectively eradicate mixed populations of antigen-positive and antigen-negative tumor cells, whereas equally potent conjugates with non-cleavable thioether bonds could not <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Target Cell Specificity\n\nNon-cleavable linkers offer superior target cell specificity compared to cleavable linkers:\n\n1. **Confined activity**: The charged amino acid residues that remain attached to payloads from non-cleavable linkers prevent membrane permeability, confining their cytotoxic effects to cells that have internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"278236118\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Reduced off-target effects**: This confined activity contributes to the reduced systemic toxicity profile of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers <Paper corpusId=\"274892504\" paperTitle=\"(Tang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Homogeneous tumors**: Non-cleavable linkers are particularly suitable for targeting tumors with homogeneous antigen expression, where bystander effects are less critical <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Immunological Considerations\n\nBeyond direct cytotoxic effects, the bystander effect may also influence the immune response to tumors:\n\n1. **Immune cell activation**: Certain ADC payloads released through cleavable linkers can facilitate the maturation and activation of intratumoral immune cells such as dendritic cells <Paper corpusId=\"266003383\" paperTitle=\"(Wittwer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"825485\" paperTitle=\"(Muller et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Enhanced antitumor immunity**: This immune activation can potentially enhance the overall antitumor response beyond the direct cytotoxic effects of the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"207676170\" paperTitle=\"(Rios-Doria et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Design Considerations\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers involves careful consideration of tumor characteristics and therapeutic goals:\n\n1. **Tumor heterogeneity assessment**: For heterogeneous tumors, cleavable linkers with membrane-permeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Payload properties**: The chemical properties of the payload (particularly membrane permeability) significantly influence the potential for bystander effects <Paper corpusId=\"276588757\" paperTitle=\"(Yamanaka et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Balancing specificity and efficacy**: The choice between greater target specificity (non-cleavable linkers) and broader tumor cell killing (cleavable linkers) represents a key design decision in ADC development <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nThe bystander effect and target cell specificity thus represent critical considerations in ADC design, with important implications for efficacy against heterogeneous tumors and therapeutic index optimization.

For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021)", "Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity.

Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADC) are emerging as powerful treatment strategies with outstanding target-specificity and high therapeutic activity in patients with cancer. Brentuximab vedotin represents a first-in-class ADC directed against CD30+ malignancies. We hypothesized that its sustained clinical responses could be related to the stimulation of an anticancer immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that the dolastatin family of microtubule inhibitors, from which the cytotoxic component of brentuximab vedotin is derived, comprises potent inducers of phenotypic and functional dendritic cell (DC) maturation. In addition to the direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, dolastatins efficiently promoted antigen uptake and migration of tumor-resident DCs to the tumor-draining lymph nodes. Exposure of murine and human DCs to dolastatins significantly increased their capacity to prime T cells. Underlining the requirement of an intact host immune system for the full therapeutic benefit of dolastatins, the antitumor effect was far less pronounced in immunocompromised mice. We observed substantial therapeutic synergies when combining dolastatins with tumor antigen\u2013specific vaccination or blockade of the PD-1\u2013PD-L1 and CTLA-4 coinhibitory pathways. Ultimately, treatment with ADCs using dolastatins induces DC homing and activates cellular antitumor immune responses in patients.

We show that these payloads on their own induced an immune response that prevented the growth of tumors following subsequent tumor cell challenge. ADCs had greater antitumor activity in immunocompetent versus immunodeficient mice, demonstrating a contribution of the immune system to the antitumor activity of these ADCs. ADCs also induced immunologic memory. In the CT26 model, depletion of CD8+ T cells abrogated the activity of ADCs when used alone or in combination with a PD-L1 antibody, confirming a role for T cells in antitumor activity.

MMAF is a new antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity compared to its uncharged counterpart, MMAE, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates were >2200-fold more potent than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. As with cAC10-L1-MMAE, the corresponding MMAF ADC induced cures and regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several new linkers were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the most promising linkers contained a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as cAC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. LCMS studies indicated that drug released from cAC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells.
