{"reformulated1": "How has classifier-free guidance (CFG) been adapted and applied in NLP-specific generative tasks such as conditional text generation or language modeling, and what benefits or trade-offs have been observed compared to traditional conditioning methods?", "reformulated2": "What are the recent innovations or advanced techniques in classifier-free guidance, such as compressed CFG, negative guidance, or geometric filtering, and how do they address quality-diversity trade-offs in image and text generation tasks?", "reformulated3": "In what ways has classifier-free guidance inspired or been integrated into generative models beyond conditional diffusion, such as flow matching models or large language models for image token generation, and what modifications were necessary for these cross-architectural extensions?"}
