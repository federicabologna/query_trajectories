{"reformulated1": "How do distinct linguistic capabilities such as syntax, world knowledge, and reasoning emerge at different phases during language model training, and what are the characteristic phase transitions observed?", "reformulated2": "What is the impact of model architecture, specifically comparing Transformer and LSTM models, on the order and rate of linguistic knowledge acquisition during training?", "reformulated3": "Which metrics and analytical methods, such as token-level loss analysis, stability measures, or phase transition detection, are most effective for tracking and interpreting the developmental stages of language model training dynamics?"}
