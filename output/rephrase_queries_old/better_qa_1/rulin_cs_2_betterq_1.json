{"reformulated1": "How do sparse attention mechanisms and memory-efficient implementations, such as FlashAttention and BigBird, compare in their ability to extend transformer context length while minimizing computational costs?", "reformulated2": "What are the practical trade-offs between position encoding approaches like ALiBi, RoPE/LongRoPE, and parallel context windows for enabling transformer models to process sequences significantly longer than their training context?", "reformulated3": "How do memory/recurrent-based architectures like Transformer-XL and Recurrent Memory Transformer enable long-context modeling, and how do they interact with sequence parallelism techniques in large transformer models?"}
