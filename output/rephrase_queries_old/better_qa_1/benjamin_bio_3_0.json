Image-guided surgery utilizes various imaging modalities to locate and characterize breast lesions before and during surgical procedures, allowing for more accurate tumor removal while preserving healthy breast tissue. This approach has become increasingly important as breast conservation therapy (BCT) has become the standard of care for many patients, replacing more radical procedures like mastectomy when appropriate. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe effectiveness of image-guided surgery depends significantly on breast cancer stage, as tumor characteristics, extent of disease, and treatment goals differ between early and advanced stages. In early-stage breast cancer (Stages 0-II), image guidance primarily focuses on precise localization of smaller tumors for breast-conserving surgery, with emphasis on negative margins and minimal tissue removal. For advanced-stage disease (Stages III-IV), image guidance often supports more extensive surgical approaches, helps assess treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy, and aids in managing metastatic disease. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nDifferent imaging modalities offer varying benefits for surgical guidance based on tumor stage, size, and location.

Methods A total of 1851 women for whom followup data were available and nodal status was known underwent randomly assigned treatment consisting of total mastectomy, lumpectomy alone, or lumpectomy and breast irradiation. Kaplan\u2013Meier and cumulative-incidence estimates of the outcome were obtained. Results The cumulative incidence of recurrent tumor in the ipsilateral breast was 14.3 percent in the women who underwent lumpectomy and breast irradiation, as compared with 39.2 percent in the women who underwent lumpectomy without irradiation (P<0.001). No significant differences were observed among the three groups of women with respect to disease-free survival, distant-disease\u2013free survival, or overall survival. The hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent lumpectomy alone, as compared with those who underwent total mastectomy, was 1.05 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.23; P=0.51). The hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation, as compared with those who underwent total mastectomy, was 0.97 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.14; P=0.74). Among the lumpectomy-treated women whose surgical specimens had tumor-free margins, the hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent postoperative breast irradiation, as compared with those who did not, was 0.91 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.06; P=0.23). Radiation therapy was associated with a marginally significant decrease in deaths due to breast cancer. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in deaths from other causes. Conclusions Lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation continues to be appropriate therapy for women with breast cancer, provided that the margins of resected specimens are free of tumor and an acceptable cosmetic result can be obtained.

We compared the clinical end points of patients with breast cancer treated preoperatively with systemic therapy (neoadjuvant therapy) and of those treated postoperatively with the same regimen (adjuvant therapy) in a meta-analysis of randomized trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe evaluated nine randomized studies, including a total of 3946 patients with breast cancer, that compared neoadjuvant therapy with adjuvant therapy regardless of what additional surgery and/or radiation treatment was used. Fixed and random effects methods were used to combine data. Primary outcomes were death, disease progression, distant disease recurrence, and loco-regional disease recurrence. Secondary outcomes were local response and conservative local treatment. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found no statistically or clinically significant difference between neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvant therapy arms associated with death (summary risk ratio [RR] = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90 to 1.12), disease progression (summary RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.07), or distant disease recurrence (summary RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.06).

Since the early 1980s, the role of preoperative chemotherapy in early stage (or operable) breast cancer has been the subject of study. Potential advantages are early introduction of systemic therapy, determination of chemosensitivity, reduction of tumour volume and downstaging of surgical requirement. Concerns exist about local control after downsized surgery and the delay of local treatment in patients with tumours resistant to chemotherapy.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness of preoperative chemotherapy in women with operable breast cancer when compared to postoperative chemotherapy.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nThe Specialised Register maintained by the Editorial Base of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched on 4th of August 2005.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials comparing preoperative chemotherapy with postoperative in women with operable breast cancer.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nStudies were assessed for eligibility and quality, and data were extracted by two independent review authors. Hazard ratios were derived for time-to-event outcomes directly or indirectly using the methods described by Parmar. Relative risks were derived for dichotomous outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed using fixed effect model.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified 14 eligible studies which randomised a total of 5,500 women. Median follow-up ranged from 18 to 124 months. Eight studies described a satisfactory method of randomisation.Data, based on 1139 estimated deaths in 4620 women available for analysis, show equivalent overall survival rates with a HR of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.09; p, 0.67; no heterogeneity). Preoperative chemotherapy increases breast conservation rates, yet at the associated cost of increased loco regional recurrence rates.

The distance of each clip from the position of the target calcification was assessed using stereotactic coordinates in 52 sequential cases and was measured on mammograms before and after biopsy in 108 clips deployed through an 11-gauge probe and 98 clips deployed using an 18-gauge needle. Variance in clip position between postbiopsy and follow-up mammograms was measured in 43 clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and in 44 clips placed with an 18-gauge needle. Comparable measurements of variance in position of fat necrosis calcifications between screening mammograms were used as controls.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-seven percent of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 98% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle were within 1 cm of the target calcifications using stereotactic coordinates. On mammograms obtained after biopsy, 70% of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 63% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle were within 1 cm of the target calcifications, and the position of 91% of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 90% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle varied less than 15 mm on follow-up mammograms. Both clips provided accurate targets for wire-localized excisions. The cost of the 11-gauge needle and clip is $320. The 14-gauge probe, vascular clip, and 18-gauge spinal needle cost $191.58.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA vascular ligating clip delivered to a stereotactic core biopsy site by an 18-gauge spinal needle is comparable in apparent accuracy and stability to a clip deployed through an 11-gauge probe.

Therefore, a combination technique of MRI and real-time ultrasound imaging, namely \"real-time MRI navigated ultrasound\" could be more objective, and can enhance the sensitivity of conventional ultrasound for initially detected breast lesions on MRI during the second-look ultrasound evaluation (Nakano et al., 2012)(Nakano et al., 2012)(Nakano et al., 2009)(Pons et al., 2014)."], "score": 0.86328125}, {"id": "(Newbury et al., 2022)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 249903023, "title": "Interventional oncology update", "year": 2022, "venue": "European Journal of Radiology Open", "authors": [{"name": "A.

The design of this American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) trial, from the multi-institutional setting to source documentation and independent data analysis, is excellent from every aspect. This study and several other previously published trials demonstrate how important it is to have institutions like ACRIN sponsor and help organize prospective clinical trials that follow good clinical practice in the world of diagnostic imaging, which, unlike clinical research in the therapeutic sector, has to proceed without the financial support and scientific infrastructure usually provided by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The results of this study are impressive. Ultrasound was associated with a 55% increase in diagnosing breast cancer compared with mammography alone: a 7.6 per 1000 to 11.8 per 1000. The sensitivity with which breast cancer was detected was 77.5% (32 of 41) for the combined use of ultrasound and mammography vs 49% (20 of 41) for mammography alone. Given that mammography is the standard of care, one could argue that a main finding of this study is the apparently limited sensitivity of screening mammography. However, this finding is in keeping with recent results of several mammographic screening studies. Depending on the composition of the screening cohort, the sensitivity can be as low as 25% for BRCA1 mutation carriers, but even in women at average risk, for instance in almost 50 000 women who participated in theDigitalMammographic ImagingScreening trial, theoverall sensitivity of screening mammography was only 55%. It is well established that mammography and ultrasound are complementary for diagnosing breast cancer. Ultrasound performs best in cases for which mammography performs weakest, ie, in breast areas with of dense fibroglandular tissue. Yet, breast ultrasound is seldom used for screening in the United States, and to date, none of the worldwide screening programs offers ultrasound. Reservations against the use of ultrasound include costs, frequency of falsepositive findings, and lack of evidence from randomized trials on mortality end points. The results from this study by Berg and colleagues confirm that the positive predictive value of screening ultrasound is indeed low. Of 233 women for whom biopsy was recommended based on a suspicious ultrasound finding, only 20 (8.6%) were diagnosed with breast cancer. Stated otherwise, 91.4% of all suspicious ultrasound findings identified by expert breast radiologists were due to benign changes. Although this seems to be a key argument against the use of breast ultrasound, one should consider that mammography, the accepted standard of care for screening, had a positive predictive value of 14.7% (20 of 136) in the same cohort. In the cohort of 2712 women, the number of falsepositive diagnoses increased from 116 (for mammography alone) to 275 (for the combined use of mammography and ultrasound). This might be considered far too many. But this has to be weighted against the benefit of the additional cancer diagnosis yield of ultrasound. Twelve cancers, ie, 29% of the total 41 cancers, were only detected by ultrasound. Whether this is sufficient to justify the many false-positive ultrasound diagnoses is something every individual woman may have to decide for herself. Of note, comparing only numbers of false-positive diagnoses may not be fair because a suspicious finding made by mammography usually requires stereotactic, mostly vacuumassisted biopsy, an expensive and time-consuming procedure. In comparison, a positive ultrasound finding can be investigated by ultrasound-guided core biopsy (or even fineneedle aspiration), a simple, fast, and inexpensive procedure that often may be performed immediately. Accordingly, the average false-positive ultrasound may not have the same implications as the average false-positive mammographic diagnosis. This statement should not downplay the problem. Falsepositive diagnoses should be avoided not only because they add to the overall costs of a screening program but also because they may stimulate unnecessary anxieties.

The distance of each clip from the position of the target calcification was assessed using stereotactic coordinates in 52 sequential cases and was measured on mammograms before and after biopsy in 108 clips deployed through an 11-gauge probe and 98 clips deployed using an 18-gauge needle. Variance in clip position between postbiopsy and follow-up mammograms was measured in 43 clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and in 44 clips placed with an 18-gauge needle. Comparable measurements of variance in position of fat necrosis calcifications between screening mammograms were used as controls.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-seven percent of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 98% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle were within 1 cm of the target calcifications using stereotactic coordinates. On mammograms obtained after biopsy, 70% of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 63% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle were within 1 cm of the target calcifications, and the position of 91% of the clips placed with an 11-gauge probe and 90% of the clips placed using an 18-gauge needle varied less than 15 mm on follow-up mammograms. Both clips provided accurate targets for wire-localized excisions. The cost of the 11-gauge needle and clip is $320. The 14-gauge probe, vascular clip, and 18-gauge spinal needle cost $191.58.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA vascular ligating clip delivered to a stereotactic core biopsy site by an 18-gauge spinal needle is comparable in apparent accuracy and stability to a clip deployed through an 11-gauge probe.
