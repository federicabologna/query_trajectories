Considerable amounts of soluble protein are required for many analysis techniques such as circular dichroism, crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (Pacheco et al., 2012). However, due to high-level expression, many recombinant proteins form inactive insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm called inclusion bodies which are devoid of biological activities. A high concentration of denaturing agents is needed to solubilize and recover functionally active proteins from these aggregates. This process is challenging procedure and may result in the loss of secondary structure and poor recovery of bioactive proteins (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2020)(Soheili et al., 2020). Moreover, a successful refolding process must be experimentally obtained for each protein. For example, in one study, for optimizing refolding parameters, the effect of more than 200 different buffers on solubilizing of recombinant falcipain-2 IBs was evaluated. They observed that an alkaline buffer containing sucrose or glycerol and glutathione resulted in high yield of solubilized protein (Sijwali et al., 2001). So, developing an efficient approach which can decrease inclusion bodies' formation without decreasing production yield would reduce the need of additional purification steps and downstream processing costs. Remarkably, to reduce the cost of economic and commercial-scale recombinant protein production, researchers put enormous efforts on elevating expression yield of soluble recombinant proteins (Salehinia et al., 2018). Although a universal approach to circumvent this problem does not exist, various strategies have been described to promote the in vivo solubility of the recombinant protein in this bacterial host.

Inclusion bodies are aggregates of biomolecules, mostly proteins, to which the bacteria become more susceptible during the recombinant expression [143]. The physicochemical properties of amino acids, particularly the hydrophobic interactions, are key factors that govern the formation of inclusion bodies [144]. As the RMPs have not undergone natural selection, they might exhibit instability issues, being more prone to form inclusion bodies. Moreover, protein expression at high rates also triggers inclusion body formation, which is a common feature of BL21 derivative strains. For instance, T7 promoters are able to raise recombinant proteins to constitute 50% of total cell proteins within a few hours [145]. The inclusion bodies form more readily under metabolic stress as the production of recombinant and host proteins compete for resources. This contest arises from the overload on DNA replication, the rivalry for transcription and translation elements, and the supplementary energy [146].\n\nThree leading ways to avoid inclusion body formation without involving the RMP redesigning are (') reduce recombinant protein production, (2) use stress-adapted strains, or (3) insert certain adjustments into the RMP's plasmids. The first approach mainly consists of culturing E. coli at lower temperatures (30\u00b0 to 25 \u00b0C), slowing down expression, and enhancing protein stability [147,148]. Furthermore, strains containing plasmids, such as pLysS or pLysE, significantly benefit RMP production by using T7 promoters, preventing inclusion body formation [149].

Inclusion bodies are aggregates of biomolecules, mostly proteins, to which the bacteria become more susceptible during the recombinant expression [143]. The physicochemical properties of amino acids, particularly the hydrophobic interactions, are key factors that govern the formation of inclusion bodies [144]. As the RMPs have not undergone natural selection, they might exhibit instability issues, being more prone to form inclusion bodies. Moreover, protein expression at high rates also triggers inclusion body formation, which is a common feature of BL21 derivative strains. For instance, T7 promoters are able to raise recombinant proteins to constitute 50% of total cell proteins within a few hours [145]. The inclusion bodies form more readily under metabolic stress as the production of recombinant and host proteins compete for resources. This contest arises from the overload on DNA replication, the rivalry for transcription and translation elements, and the supplementary energy [146].\n\nThree leading ways to avoid inclusion body formation without involving the RMP redesigning are (') reduce recombinant protein production, (2) use stress-adapted strains, or (3) insert certain adjustments into the RMP's plasmids. The first approach mainly consists of culturing E. coli at lower temperatures (30\u00b0 to 25 \u00b0C), slowing down expression, and enhancing protein stability [147,148]. Furthermore, strains containing plasmids, such as pLysS or pLysE, significantly benefit RMP production by using T7 promoters, preventing inclusion body formation [149]. These plasmids co-express T7 lysozyme, which suppresses transcriptional leak of recombinant genes, an approach adopted for expression of the following RMPs: r-LMP, ITC 8.2, USM.TOXO1, rMEHB, and rMEHCV [2,10,19,31]40]."], "score": 0.9599609375}, {"id": "(Zeng et al., 2019)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 73422188, "title": "Quantification of proteomic and metabolic burdens predicts growth retardation and overflow metabolism in recombinant Escherichia coli", "year": 2019, "venue": "Biotechnology and Bioengineering", "authors": [{"name": "H.

Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful.

In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Kolaj et al., 2009)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 15379654, "title": "Use of folding modulators to improve heterologous protein production in Escherichia coli", "year": 2009, "venue": "Microbial Cell Factories", "authors": [{"name": "Olga Kolaj", "authorId": "4489767"}, {"name": "S.

Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation (Carrio et al., 2003)(Marco, 2007)(Ronez et al., 2012). The commonly used molecular chaperones in E. coli are GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor (Table 2).

The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding (Folwarczna et al., 2012). Some chaperones such as heat shock proteins IpbA and IpbB prevent aggregation of heat denatured proteins (Guzzo, 2012).

However, due to high-level expression, many recombinant proteins form inactive insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm called inclusion bodies which are devoid of biological activities. A high concentration of denaturing agents is needed to solubilize and recover functionally active proteins from these aggregates. This process is challenging procedure and may result in the loss of secondary structure and poor recovery of bioactive proteins (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2020)(Soheili et al., 2020).

A variety of methods have been reported to tackle these issues, for instance, optimizing culture and purification conditions (Kiedzierska et al., 2008), recovering and re-folding active proteins from inclusion bodies (Singh et al., 2015), expression in the periplasm, and many others (Ban et al., 2020). In addition to this array of strategies, in this study we have coupled two, somewhat disjoint methodologies, but when combined lead to significantly increased yields of soluble protein. \n\nFirst, we sought to reduce inclusion body formation with an autoinduction method mediated by rewiring the genetic circuitry of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) so that instead of mediating endogenous QS functions like biofilm formation, we engineered cells to induce expression of genes-of-interest. Overexpression of a recombinant protein is often accompanied by an imbalance of metabolism, often referred to as a \"metabolic burden\" (Bentley et al., 1990). In addition, the induction process is typically initiated by the addition of a bolus of inducer, which, in turn, can bring about significant transients in precursors or energy levels (Harcum et al., 1993)(Ramirez et al., 1995)(DeLisa et al., 2001). This imposed stress could exhaust the bacterium's innate protein folding and quality control machinery, leading to improperly folded proteins that aggregate and form inclusion bodies or get targeted for degradation."], "score": 0.95751953125}], "table": null}], "cost": 0.7941480000000001}}
