On the other hand, a small percentage of the vesicles follow a different route in which they fuse with the abluminal membrane and open to the basal membrane. In these cases, the 8D3-AuNPs remain attached to the abluminal membrane, which suggests an endosomal escape, but not dissociation from TfR.

Our results indicated a TfR-mediated and clathrin-dependent internalization process by which 8D3-AuNPs internalize individually in vesicles. These vesicles then follow at least two different routes. On one hand, most vesicles enter intracellular processes of vesicular fusion and rearrangement in which the AuNPs end up accumulating in late endosomes, multivesicular bodies or lysosomes, which present a high AuNP content. On the other hand, a small percentage of the vesicles follow a different route in which they fuse with the abluminal membrane and open to the basal membrane. In these cases, the 8D3-AuNPs remain attached to the abluminal membrane, which suggests an endosomal escape, but not dissociation from TfR.

However, FUS-induced inertial cavitation of microbubbles can also result in erythrocyte extravasations. Here we investigated whether induction of submicron bubbles to oscillate at their resonant frequency would reduce inertial cavitation during BBB-opening and thereby eliminate erythrocyte extravasations in a rat brain model. FUS was delivered with acoustic pressures of 0.1\u20134.5 MPa using either in-house manufactured submicron bubbles or standard SonoVue microbubbles. Wideband and subharmonic emissions from bubbles were used to quantify inertial and stable cavitation, respectively. Erythrocyte extravasations were evaluated by in vivo post-treatment magnetic resonance susceptibility-weighted imaging, and finally by histological confirmation. We found that excitation of submicron bubbles with resonant frequency-matched FUS (10 MHz) can greatly limit inertial cavitation while enhancing stable cavitation. The BBB-opening was mainly caused by stable cavitation, whereas the erythrocyte extravasation was closely correlated with inertial cavitation. Our technique allows extensive reduction of inertial cavitation to induce safe BBB-opening. Furthermore, the safety issue of BBB-opening was not compromised by prolonging FUS exposure time, and the local drug concentrations in the brain tissues were significantly improved to 60 times (BCNU; 18.6 \u00b5g versus 0.3 \u00b5g) by using chemotherapeutic agent-loaded submicron bubbles with FUS.

Surfactant coatings such as polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 188 facilitate this process by enabling the adsorption of plasma apolipoproteins, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), onto the nanoparticle surface. This modification essentially mimics low-density lipoproteins (LDL), allowing recognition by LDL receptors expressed on brain endothelial cells and subsequent transport via receptor-mediated endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"225464702\" paperTitle=\"(Hartl et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"268928188\" paperTitle=\"(Narsinh et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Targeted nanoparticles have been shown to elevate plasma membrane fluidity, indicating the fusion of nanovesicles with endothelial cell membranes <Paper corpusId=\"245622624\" paperTitle=\"(Veszelka et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This mechanism appears particularly effective when multiple targeting ligands are employed simultaneously.

Surfactants such as polysorbate 80 and PEG-D-\u03b1-tocopheryl can enhance BBB permeation by inhibiting the efflux action of P-glycoprotein and solubilizing cell membrane lipids of brain endothelial cells <Paper corpusId=\"10445103\" paperTitle=\"(Kanwar et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. This dual action\u2014inhibiting efflux pumps while facilitating membrane permeation\u2014significantly improves the ability of nanoparticles to deliver their therapeutic payload across the BBB.\n\nThe creation of concentration gradients represents a less-studied but potentially important mechanism.

This review article summarizes the presently used and the most promising in vitro BBB models based on the culture of brain endothelial cells. Robust models can be obtained using primary porcine brain endothelial cells and rodent coculture models, which have low paracellular permeability and express functional efflux transporters, showing good correlation of drug penetration data with in vivo results. Models mimicking the in vivo anatomophysiological complexity of the BBB are also available, including triple coculture (culture of brain endothelial cells in the presence of pericytes and astrocytes), dynamic, and microfluidic models; however, these are not suitable for rapid, high throughput studies.

Monoclonal antibodies directed against the transferrin receptor (TfR) have been proposed as potential carrier candidates. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in their cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking is required and could critically contribute to the improvement of delivery methods. Accordingly, we studied here the trafficking of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with the 8D3 anti-transferrin receptor antibody at the mouse BBB. 8D3-AuNPs were intravenously administered to mice and allowed to recirculate for a range of times, from 10 min to 24 h, before brain extraction and analysis by transmission electron microscope techniques. Our results indicated a TfR-mediated and clathrin-dependent internalization process by which 8D3-AuNPs internalize individually in vesicles. These vesicles then follow at least two different routes. On one hand, most vesicles enter intracellular processes of vesicular fusion and rearrangement in which the AuNPs end up accumulating in late endosomes, multivesicular bodies or lysosomes, which present a high AuNP content. On the other hand, a small percentage of the vesicles follow a different route in which they fuse with the abluminal membrane and open to the basal membrane. In these cases, the 8D3-AuNPs remain attached to the abluminal membrane, which suggests an endosomal escape, but not dissociation from TfR.
