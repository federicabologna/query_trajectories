Many investigations have been conducted across the biopharmaceutical industry to identify the root causes, and multiple strategies have been proposed to mitigate the problem. The reduction is correlated with the release of cellular reducing components and depletion of dissolved oxygen before, during, and after harvest. Consequently, these factors can lead to disulfide reduction over long-duration storage at room temperature prior to Protein A chromatography. Several strategies have been developed to minimize antibody reduction, including chemical inhibition of reducing components, maintaining aeration before and after harvest, and chilling clarified harvest during holding. Here, we explore the use of hydrogen peroxide in clarified harvest bulk or cell culture fluid as a strategy to prevent disulfide reduction. A lab-scale study was performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide in preventing antibody reduction using multiple IgG molecules. Studies were done to define the optimal concentration of hydrogen peroxide needed to avoid unnecessary oxidization of the antibody products. We show that adding a controlled amount of hydrogen peroxide does not change product quality attributes of the protein. Since hydrogen peroxide is soluble in aqueous solutions and decomposes into water and oxygen, there is no additional burden involved in removing it during the downstream purification steps.

Many investigations have been conducted across the biopharmaceutical industry to identify the root causes, and multiple strategies have been proposed to mitigate the problem. The reduction is correlated with the release of cellular reducing components and depletion of dissolved oxygen before, during, and after harvest. Consequently, these factors can lead to disulfide reduction over long-duration storage at room temperature prior to Protein A chromatography. Several strategies have been developed to minimize antibody reduction, including chemical inhibition of reducing components, maintaining aeration before and after harvest, and chilling clarified harvest during holding. Here, we explore the use of hydrogen peroxide in clarified harvest bulk or cell culture fluid as a strategy to prevent disulfide reduction. A lab-scale study was performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide in preventing antibody reduction using multiple IgG molecules. Studies were done to define the optimal concentration of hydrogen peroxide needed to avoid unnecessary oxidization of the antibody products. We show that adding a controlled amount of hydrogen peroxide does not change product quality attributes of the protein. Since hydrogen peroxide is soluble in aqueous solutions and decomposes into water and oxygen, there is no additional burden involved in removing it during the downstream purification steps.
