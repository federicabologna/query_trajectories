{"reformulated1": "What empirical evidence exists on catastrophic forgetting or performance degradation in LLMs after fine-tuning for alignment or factuality tasks?", "reformulated2": "How does fine-tuning LLMs for recommendation systems specifically impact their capabilities in general language generation and creative writing tasks?", "reformulated3": "What strategies, such as data pruning or domain-invariant feature extraction, have been shown to mitigate the loss of generality in LLMs during task-specific fine-tuning?"}
