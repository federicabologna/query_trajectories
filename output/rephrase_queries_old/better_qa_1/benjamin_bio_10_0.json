Such unique pathophysiologic properties of tumor vasculature provide nanosized drug carriers with long circulation time. For example, PEGylated liposomes were leaked and retained specifically into tumor tissues rather than normal ones. Consequently, reduced drug toxicity is expected when using PEGylated liposomes containing anticancer drugs. This process is known as enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) and is extensively exploited to achieve passive targeting of chemotherapeutic agents (Nakamura et al., 2014)(Andriyanov et al., 2017)(Buyens et al., 2012).

Generally, compounds greater than 40 kDa benefit from the EPR effect and can accumulate at the tumor site. An additional benefit of these macromolecules is their prolonged circulation time compared to smaller molecules that are rapidly cleared by the liver and kidneys [49]. While targeted molecules have tumor targeting abilities, their initial diffusion from the vasculature into the tumor tissue relies on the EPR effect like untargeted molecules. Due to the inter-and intra-patient heterogeneity of the EPR effect, treatment efficacy varies between patients, leading to dissimilar outcomes in clinical trials. The EPR effect is so heterologous because multiple vascular as well as micro-environmental factors contribute to the EPR. At the vascular level, main contributors are vascular permeability, expression of endothelial receptors and the degree of vascular maturation (as tumors rapidly enhance angiogenesis the maturation state is significantly different from healthy tissues). Micro-environmental contributors include the extracellular matrix, presence of hypoxia, interstitial fluid pressure and tumor cell density [90].

However, the understanding of differences in the EPR-effect between tumor types, heterogeneities within each patient group, and dependency on tumor development stage in humans is sparse. It is therefore important to enhance our understanding of the EPR-effect in large animals and humans with spontaneously developed cancer.

We thereby provide the first high-resolution analysis of EPR-based tumor accumulation in large animals. We find that the EPR-effect is strong in some tumor types but cannot be considered a general feature of solid malignant tumors since we observed a high degree of accumulation heterogeneity between tumors.

Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15]. The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16]. It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels.

We find that the EPR-effect is strong in some tumor types but cannot be considered a general feature of solid malignant tumors since we observed a high degree of accumulation heterogeneity between tumors.

EPR is observed in various solid tumors, and is characterized by abnormal tumor vasculature, tumor permeability, and a lack of effective lymphatic drainage (Wu, 2021). The leaky tumor vasculature allows for nanoparticles to extravasate through surrounding blood vessels (Maeda et al., 2013). Together, these function to help nanoparticles persist and accumulate in tumors, allowing for retention and direct delivery to the site of interest (Wu, 2021)."], "score": 0.8955078125}, {"id": "(Wu, 2021)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 237330183, "title": "The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect: The Significance of the Concept and Methods to Enhance Its Application", "year": 2021, "venue": "Journal of Personalized Medicine", "authors": [{"name": "Jun Wu", "authorId": "2146666043"}], "n_citations": 514}, "snippets": ["Chemotherapy for human solid tumors in clinical practice is far from satisfactory. Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents.

Nanosized drugs have a large loading capacity, the ability to protect the payload from degradation, a large surface on which to conjugate targeting ligands, and controlled or sustained release. Nanosized drugs also leak preferentially into tumor tissue through permeable tumor vessels and are then retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage. This process is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, while the EPR effect is widely held to improve delivery of nanodrugs to tumors, it in fact offers less than a 2-fold increase in nanodrug delivery compared with critical normal organs, resulting in drug concentrations that are not sufficient for curing most cancers. In this Review, we first overview various barriers for nanosized drug delivery with an emphasis on the capillary wall's resistance, the main obstacle to delivering drugs.

Such high accumulation usually last more than 24 hours [45]. This phenomenon was attributed to the hypervasculature and enhanced vascular permeability in solid tumors, which is due to the overproduction of vascular mediators including bradykinin, nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and carbon monoxide (CO) [46]. Moreover, solid tumors have defective blood vessels with large gaps, up to 1.0 \u03bcm between endothelial cells, whereby macromolecules pass to the tumor [14]. Since solid tumors lack adequate lymphatic drainage, there is therefore a poor circulatory recovery of the extravasated macromolecules, resulting in their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment for long periods [14]. This phenomenon was not observed in healthy blood vessels [45]; hence, it constituted a promising strategy to treat selectively cancer solid tumors using nanocarriers like polymer-coated liposomes [47]."], "score": 0.87890625}, {"id": "(Deshpande et al., 2013)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 2206035, "title": "Current trends in the use of liposomes for tumor targeting.", "year": 2013, "venue": "Nanomedicine", "authors": [{"name": "Pranali P.
