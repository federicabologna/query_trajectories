{"reformulated1": "What are the comparative effects of FastText-based versus BERT-based classifiers on the quality and efficiency of pre-training data filtering for large language models?", "reformulated2": "How does the use of reference-dependent versus reference-free data quality filtering approaches impact downstream performance of transformer-based models like BERT and GPT-3?", "reformulated3": "What evidence exists regarding the risks of excessive data filtering (e.g., reduced diversity, performance degradation) in major LLMs, and how have recent models like Llama-3 or PaLM addressed the tradeoff between quality and quantity in their data pipelines?"}
