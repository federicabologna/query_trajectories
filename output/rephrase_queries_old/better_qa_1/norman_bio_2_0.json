(LLM Memory)", "text": "\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics, but their tendency to accumulate primarily in hepatocytes presents a challenge when targeting liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). LSECs constitute approximately 15-20% of liver cells and perform critical functions including blood filtration, immune regulation, and mediating the exchange of molecules between blood and the space of Disse. Unlike hepatocytes, LSECs have distinctive characteristics such as fenestrations (small pores), lack of a basement membrane, and specific surface receptors that can be exploited for targeted delivery. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe conventional LNP formulations used for RNA delivery typically consist of four main components: ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids. These standard formulations predominantly deliver their cargo to hepatocytes through interactions with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and subsequent uptake via low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs). This natural tropism for hepatocytes creates a significant barrier to LSEC-specific targeting, necessitating specialized strategies to redirect LNPs to these endothelial cells. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nDeveloping LSEC-targeted LNPs requires a multifaceted approach that considers the unique anatomical location of LSECs at the interface between blood and liver parenchyma, their distinct endocytic receptor profile, and their fenestrated structure. Successful targeting strategies must not only enhance LNP interactions with LSECs but also reduce hepatocyte uptake to improve specificity. This introduction frames the subsequent discussion of specific targeting approaches including ligand-mediated targeting, lipid composition modifications, physical characteristic optimization, pKa adjustments, and passive targeting mechanisms. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">", "citations": [], "table": null}, {"title": "Ligand-Mediated Targeting Strategies", "tldr": "Mannose receptor targeting has emerged as the most effective ligand-mediated strategy for LSEC-specific delivery, enabling selective RNA delivery while minimizing hepatocyte uptake.

One of the most effective approaches involves replacing standard cholesterol with oxidized cholesterol variants. Paunovska et al. demonstrated that LNPs formulated with oxidized cholesterol could deliver mRNA to liver microenvironmental cells, including LSECs, at a fivefold higher potency than to hepatocytes, even at clinically relevant doses of 0.05 mg/kg. <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> This oxidized cholesterol approach was confirmed by multiple independent studies, establishing its reliability for shifting LNP targeting from hepatocytes to LSECs. <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256547368\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe specific structure of the oxidized cholesterol appears to be crucial for LSEC targeting efficacy.

Pattipeiluhu et al. developed scavenger receptor LNPs (srLNPs) by substituting the zwitterionic lipid DSPC used in the approved Onpattro formulation with the anionic lipid DSPG. <Paper corpusId=\"247129065\" paperTitle=\"(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"257862241\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al._1, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> This simple change dramatically altered the biodistribution profile of the LNPs, redirecting them from hepatocytes to LSECs and Kupffer cells. The mechanism appears to involve both enhanced binding to scavenger receptors (stabilin-1/2) on LSECs and reduced interaction with apolipoprotein E, which typically mediates hepatocyte uptake through LDL receptors. <Paper corpusId=\"259055696\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nComparative studies have confirmed the differential targeting patterns of these modified LNPs. Phosphatidylglycerol-containing LNPs accumulate predominantly in LSECs and Kupffer cells, while phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs distribute more evenly across hepatocytes, LSECs, and Kupffer cells. <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> This clear distinction in cellular tropism makes lipid composition modifications a valuable approach for LSEC-specific targeting.\n\nThese compositional strategies can be combined with other approaches, such as ligand-mediated targeting, to further enhance LSEC specificity.

This modification switches LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic, redirecting delivery from hepatocytes to LSECs through interactions with scavenger receptors (stabilin-1/2). <Paper corpusId=\"247129065\" paperTitle=\"(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276413641\" paperTitle=\"(Hosseini-Kharat et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n3. **Oxidized cholesterol incorporation**: Using oxidized cholesterol in place of standard cholesterol in LNP formulations can achieve a fivefold improvement in mRNA delivery to LSECs compared to hepatocytes, even at clinically relevant low doses (0.05 mg/kg). The position of oxidative modification appears important, with modifications on the hydrocarbon tail (sterol ring D) outperforming those on sterol ring B. <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256547368\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n4. **pKa optimization**: Adjusting the pKa value of ionizable lipids from the hepatocyte-optimal range (6.4-6.5) to approximately 7.1-7.2 significantly shifts LNP distribution from hepatocytes to LSECs. An optimal pKa value of 7.15 creates an appropriate ionization status (~36% cationic charge) for LSEC uptake. <Paper corpusId=\"205208610\" paperTitle=\"(Sato et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256029453\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"56895022\" paperTitle=\"(Shobaki et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n5. **Particle size optimization**: Increasing LNP size beyond the diameter of liver sinusoidal fenestrations enhances LSEC-specific delivery by preventing passage to hepatocytes. Larger particles preferentially transfect LSECs as they cannot filter through fenestrations to reach hepatocytes. <Paper corpusId=\"205208610\" paperTitle=\"(Sato et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256547368\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n6. **GalNAc modification**: A contrasting approach involves modifying LNPs with GalNAc ligands to maximize hepatocyte specificity while reducing LSEC uptake.

For example, mannose-decorated LNPs with optimized size and high PEG content show synergistic effects by simultaneously reducing ApoE-mediated hepatocyte uptake, enhancing receptor-specific binding, and preventing passage through fenestrations. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"272554037\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n8. **Implementation considerations**: Ligand-mediated targeting can be achieved either by incorporating targeting ligands during LNP production or through post-insertion techniques, providing flexibility in manufacturing approaches. <Paper corpusId=\"272554037\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>", "citations": [{"id": "(Kim et al., 2021)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 232059366, "title": "Engineered ionizable lipid nanoparticles for targeted delivery of RNA therapeutics into different types of cells in the liver", "year": 2021, "venue": "Science Advances", "authors": [{"name": "M.
