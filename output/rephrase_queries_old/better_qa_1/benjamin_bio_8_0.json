The conception of animal welfare used by scientists must relate closely to these ethical concerns if the orientation of the research and the interpretation of the findings is to address them successfully.At least three overlapping ethical concerns are commonly expressed regarding the quality of life of animals: (1) that animals should lead natural lives through the development and use of their natural adaptations and capabilities, (2) that animals should feel well by being free from prolonged and intense fear, pain, and other negative states, and by experiencing normal pleasures, and (3) that animals should function well, in the sense of satisfactory health, growth and normal functioning of physiological and behavioural systems. Various scientists have proposed restricted conceptions of animal welfare that relate to only one or other of these three concerns. Some such conceptions are based on value positions about what is truly important for the quality of life of animals or about the nature of human responsibility for animals in their care. Others are operational claims: (1) that animal welfare research must focus on the functioning of animals because subjective experiences fall outside the realm of scientific enquiry, or (2) that studying the functioning of animals is sufficient because subjective experiences and functioning are closely correlated. We argue that none of these positions provides fully satisfactory guidance for animal welfare research.We suggest instead that ethical concerns about the quality of life of animals can be better captured by recognizing three classes of problems that may arise when the adaptations possessed by an animal do not fully correspond to the challenges posed by its current environment. (I) If animals possess adaptations that no longer serve a significant function in the new environment, then unpleasant subjective experiences may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant disruption to biological functioning. Thus, a bucket-fed calf may experience a strong, frustrated desire to suck, even though it obtains adequate milk. (2) If the environment poses challenges for which the animal has no corresponding adaptation, then functional problems may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant effects on subjective feelings. Thus, a pig breathing polluted air may develop lung damage without appearing to notice or mind the problem. (3) Where animals have adaptations corresponding to the kinds of environmental challenges they face, problems may still arise if the adaptations prove inadequate. For example, an animal's thermoregulatory adaptations may be insufficient in a very cold environment such that the animal both feels poorly and functions poorly. We propose that all three types of problems are causes of ethical concern over the quality of life of animals and that they together define the subject matter of animal welfare science."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Krebs et al., 2025)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 276315377, "title": "Considering the Risks and Costs of Solid Organ Xenotransplantation", "year": 2025, "venue": "Advances in Biology", "authors": [{"name": "Catharine E.

Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions.

For example, if genetic engineering makes farm animals more productive, this may have the effect of boosting productivity to a level that results in a welfare concern. This concern depends upon the effect of the specific transgene that is being investigated and is not a concern that is unique to genetic engineering. Any genetic improvement program directed exclusively towards high production efficiency has the potential to cause animal welfare concerns, irrespective of the techniques used to obtain that goal 38 C There are two central ethical concerns associated with the genetic engineering of animals.

We regarded this as an important contribution to the field and have reproduced it in our journal with permission in order to give it a wider exposure within the transplant community. Accompanying the paper are three commentaries on different aspects of this position paper. The authors argue the case for clinical xenotransplantation well and, with the ever-growing shortage of organs for transplantation, few would argue that xenotransplantation was not a potential solution to this problem. However, there are both scientific and ethical issues to be overcome before clinical trials could occur; this position paper concentrates on the ethical issues only. Apart from the normal ethical issues raised by the entry of any patient into a clinical trial, xenotransplantation presents specific problems related to the transplantation of a pig organ (the most favored donor species) into man. Truly informed consent will be difficult in a patient, who might have terminal organ failure. In addition, there is the potential problem of introducing infection into society; at this time, the Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV) is the potential pathogen of concern. Thus the committee correctly stresses the need to assess the risks and benefits of clinical xenotransplantation, not only to the prospective patient but also to society, before any clinical trials are considered. If the risk/ benefit analysis is favorable and experimental trials commence, the committee emphasizes the need for vigilant guidelines to monitor the transmission of infection (not only in the patient, but also in the patient\u2019s immediate contacts). Furthermore, these patients will have to accept the need for long-term monitoring. As part of this risk/benefit analysis, adequate preclinical data must be available to indicate that there is a reasonable chance of a successful outcome. The question of what defines adequate preclinical data is difficult to address, the authors admit, and needs to be assessed when the first trials are being considered. This implies the continuing experimental use of nonhuman primates, which the public has mixed views about, but which is essential to provide the required preclinical data. The authors correctly regard nonhuman primates as unsuitable organ donors, not only from an ethical point of view but also because of an increased risk of transmission of viral infection, but one can see the contradictory ethical dilemma that this presents. The pig is the chosen animal for donation, as it is generally acceptable to the public and is also acceptable from a physiological and anatomical point of view. The committee reviewed the religious views on xenotransplantation and found no serious objections from the monotheistic religions whereas the nonmonotheistic religions, primarily Buddhism and Hinduism, regard it as a matter for personal conscience. In their recommendations, the need for government regulation of clinical trials is stressed by the committee, along with the need for international cooperation to develop uniform operational standards and guidelines for clinical trials. It is suggested that the International Xenotranplantation Association might lead this initiative, but it might have a more powerful voice if done with the Transplantation Society under the umbrella of the World Health Organization. In the first of the three commentaries, Cooke and colleagues discuss the problems of informed consent and wonder whether a patient waiting for a pig heart transplant, when the alternative is death, can really give informed consent. Furthermore, the patient who has a xenotransplant is not in a position to withdraw from the experimental trial which contravenes the Declaration of Helsinki. They cite a similar situation in the recipient of an artificial heart. The authors also comment on the concept of beneficence both in the donor and in society, and express the hope that the small but real risks of PERV transmission will not delay clinical trials, provided the necessary preclinical data is available and the appropriate regulations are in place. The commentary by Einsiedel, although not downplaying the ethical issues, feels that the decision to proceed with clinical trials is a political one as much as a scientific one, and that the public needs to participate fully in this decision. This applies to any new technology but is even more important in xenotransplantation, where not only is there an additional pressure on the health resources of a country but also the risk to the public of the introduction of a new pathogen. Canadian, Dutch, and Australian public surveys have all suggested that a considerable degree of caution is required by the public, and that there is a need for more information before agreeing that clinical trials should proceed. On the other hand, Wright feels that the interpretation of the Canadian study was flawed and suggests that the data reveal a considerable degree of support for the concept of clinical xenotransplantation. Wright, in his concluding sentence, \"feels that the public cannot provide useful insights into the critical safety and efficacy issues\" and these issues can only be addressed by carefully regulated trials when merited"], "score": 0.0}], "table": null}, {"title": "Proposed Solutions and Ethical Compromises", "tldr": "To address ethical concerns in xenotransplantation, researchers have proposed various solutions including rigorous ethical standards, genetic disenhancement of source animals, and guidelines limiting genetic modifications to preserve animal identity.

Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences.

Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering.

Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective.
