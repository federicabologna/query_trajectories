The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of differentorgans, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the -cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The basis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes is deficient action of insulin on target tissues. Deficient insulin action results from inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or more points in the complex pathways of hormone action. Impairment of insulin secretion and defects in insulin action frequently coexist in the same patient, and it is often unclear which abnormality, if either alone, is the primary cause of the hyperglycemia. Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia. Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome. Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial, and cerebrovascular disease. Hypertension and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are often found in people with diabetes. The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad etiopathogenetic categories (discussed in greater detail below). In one category, type 1 diabetes, the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion. Individuals at increased risk of developing this type of diabetes can often be identified by serological evidence of an autoimmune pathologic process occurring in the pancreatic islets and by genetic markers. In the other, much more prevalent category, type 2 diabetes, the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. In the latter category, a degree of hyperglycemia sufficient to cause pathologic and functional changes in various target tissues, but without clinical symptoms, may be present for a long period of time before diabetes is detected. During this asymptomatic period, it is possible to demonstrate an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism by measurement of plasma glucose in the fasting state or after a challenge with an oral glucose load. The degree of hyperglycemia (if any) may change over time, depending on the extent of the underlying disease process (Fig. 1). A disease process may be present but may not have progressed far enough to cause hyperglycemia. The same disease process can cause impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) without fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes. In some individuals with diabetes, adequate glycemic control can be achieved with weight reduction, exercise, and/or oral glucoselowering agents. These individuals therefore do not require insulin. Other individuals who have some residual insulin secretion but require exogenous insulin for adequate glycemic control can survive without it. Individuals with extensive -cell destruction and therefore no residual insulin secretion require insulin for survival. The severity of the metabolic abnormality can progress, regress, or stay the same. Thus, the degree of hyperglycemia reflects the severity of the underlying metabolic process and its treatment more than the nature of the process itself."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Kim et al., 2020)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 226269971, "title": "Long\u2010term porcine islet graft survival in diabetic non\u2010human primates treated with clinically available immunosuppressants", "year": 2020, "venue": "Xenotransplantation", "authors": [{"name": "Jong-Min Kim", "authorId": "2109227944"}, {"name": "So-Hee Hong", "authorId": "47324515"}, {"name": "Hyunwoo Chung", "authorId": "7270064"}, {"name": "Jun-Seop Shin", "authorId": "2200462628"}, {"name": "Byoung-Hoon Min", "authorId": "13037246"}, {"name": "Hyun Je Kim", "authorId": "2115442201"}, {"name": "Jiyeon Kim", "authorId": "2116411773"}, {"name": "E.

Rabbit islets were prepared by an intraductal collagenase technique and incubated in neat rabbit, human, or cynomolgus serum, with and without heat inactivation, for up to 6 days. Islets were analyzed by flow cytometry for IGG and IGM binding, and scored for viability by supravital staining. For in vivo studies, isolated islets were prepared from 4 New Zealand White rabbits (15-34 x 10(3) islets 70-85% purity) and transplanted beneath the kidney capsule of normal cynomolgus monkeys after aggregation in either a rabbit or monkey blood clot. The tissue was retrieved at various times up to 4 days after transplantation and processed for light and electron microscopy. The results showed that rabbit islets bind heterophile antibody of both IGG and IGM subtypes. There was slow loss of islet viability in vitro over 3 days of culture in neat human or cynomolgus serum. Destruction of islets in vivo was more rapid with visible damage within 6 hr associated with neutrophil infiltration. Subsequently, there was heavy mononuclear cell infiltration leading to total destruction within 4 days.

The present study was performed to investigate different functional tests as predictors of beta-cell mass in the G\u00f6ttingen minipig. beta-cell mass was reduced in the G\u00f6ttingen minipig with a combination of nicotinamide (100 [n = 6], 67 [n = 25], 20 [n = 2], or 0 mg/kg [n = 4]) and streptozotocin (125 mg/kg). Six normal pigs were included. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (n = 43) and insulin secretion test (n = 30) were performed and pancreata obtained for stereological determination of beta-cell mass. During OGTT, fasting glucose (r(2) = 0.1744, P < 0.01), area under the curve for glucose (r(2) = 0.2706, P < 0.001), maximum insulin secretion (r(2) = 0.2160, P < 0.01), and maximum C-peptide secretion (r(2) = 0.1992, P < 0.01) correlated with beta-cell mass. During the insulin secretion test, acute insulin response to 0.3 g/kg (r(2) = 0.6155, P < 0.0001) and 0.6 g/kg glucose (r(2) = 0.7321, P < 0.0001) and arginine (67 mg/kg) (r(2) = 0.7732, P < 0.0001) and maximum insulin secretion (r(2) = 0.8192, P < 0.0001) correlated with beta-cell mass.

The results showed that rabbit islets bind heterophile antibody of both IGG and IGM subtypes. There was slow loss of islet viability in vitro over 3 days of culture in neat human or cynomolgus serum.

A notable example comes from Dresden, Germany, where researchers demonstrated restoration of normoglycemia without immunosuppression in a model of rat islet xenotransplantation into diabetic minipigs using a novel immunoprotective membrane <Paper corpusId=\"277904319\" paperTitle=\"(Bottino et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"404317\" paperTitle=\"(Neufeld et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This study investigated whether coencapsulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with islets in the device enables novel method of prevascularization-free primary subcutaneous transplantation. Methods. In vitro experiments examined slow release of HGF from the chitosan gel and islet-protection effect of HGF against hypoxia.

In vitro experiments showed sustained release of HGF for 28 d and alleviating effect of HGF on cell death and glucose-responsive insulin release after hypoxic culture.

Diabetic Sinclair pigs were transplanted and followed for up to 90 days. We demonstrated a persistent graft function and restoration of normoglycemia without the need for immunosuppressive therapy.
