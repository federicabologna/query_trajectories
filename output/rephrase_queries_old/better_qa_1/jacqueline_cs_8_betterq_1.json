{"reformulated1": "What are the main differences in compression ratio, performance impact, and hardware compatibility between recent unstructured and structured pruning methods for large language models?", "reformulated2": "How do recent task-agnostic pruning approaches like SparseGPT, Wanda, OWL, LLM-Pruner, and FLAP achieve high sparsity in LLMs without significant retraining, and what benchmarks demonstrate their zero-shot generalization?", "reformulated3": "What implementation strategies and integration sequences (e.g., combination with quantization and knowledge distillation) maximize efficiency gains from pruning large language models for deployment on resource-constrained hardware?"}
