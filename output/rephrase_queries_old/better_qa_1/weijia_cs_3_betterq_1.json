{"reformulated1": "What are the key differences and tradeoffs between parameter optimization, parameter merging, in-context unlearning, and localization-based unlearning methods for removing knowledge from large language models?", "reformulated2": "How do recent localization-based unlearning techniques such as ROME, ELM, and TARS surgically remove specific factual knowledge from language models while minimizing performance degradation on unrelated tasks?", "reformulated3": "What evaluation metrics and frameworks are used to assess the effectiveness and safety of machine unlearning methods in language models, particularly regarding knowledge forgetting rate, knowledge retention rate, and robustness against extraction attacks?"}
