For LNPs containing PEG-C14 lipids, this increase has minimal impact on efficacy, whereas LNPs with PEG-C18 lipids completely lose activity at the higher concentration <Paper corpusId=\"18413960\" paperTitle=\"(Mui et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This striking difference in activity resulting from such a small change in concentration highlights the potency of the steric barrier provided by longer-chain PEG-lipids.\n\nFunctional studies with reporter proteins have confirmed that longer aliphatic PEG anchors, which show poorer desorption from LNP surfaces, result in noticeably lower expression levels across all organs <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This relationship between PEG-lipid retention and functional efficacy extends to the endosomal escape capabilities of LNPs.

Unmodified and PEGylated particles enter cells through the endocytic pathway and accumulate in a perinuclear region. Immunolabeling reveals unpackaged exogenous DNA in the cytoplasm and nuclei. It appears all particle types traffic towards the nucleus within vesicles and undergo degradation in vesicles and/or cytoplasm, and eventually some exogenous DNA enters the nucleus, where it is transcribed. In comparing polyplexes and their PEGylated variants, significant differences in particle morphology, cellular uptake, and resultant expression suggest that in vitro studies should be conducted with particles prepared for physiological conditions if the results are to be relevant to in vivo performance."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Yang et al., 2022)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 254208416, "title": "Recent Advances in Lipid Nanoparticles for Delivery of mRNA", "year": 2022, "venue": "Pharmaceutics", "authors": [{"name": "Lei Yang", "authorId": "2019059910"}, {"name": "Liming Gong", "authorId": "2159438501"}, {"name": "Ping Wang", "authorId": "2152210818"}, {"name": "Xinghui Zhao", "authorId": "50061713"}, {"name": "Feng Zhao", "authorId": "2152338355"}, {"name": "Zhijie Zhang", "authorId": "2193234583"}, {"name": "Yunfei Li", "authorId": "2110442530"}, {"name": "Wei Huang", "authorId": "2163089850"}], "n_citations": 69}, "snippets": ["Therefore, different PEGylated lipids control the circulation time of LNPs in vivo and influence the interaction of LNPs with cells.
