One of the most significant economic benefits is the relatively low cost of raw materials used in LNP production. As noted by Khurana et al., LNPs offer \"multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as... low cost of raw materials\" <Paper corpusId=\"232368936\" paperTitle=\"(Khurana et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This cost advantage provides a fundamental economic incentive for pharmaceutical companies to adopt LNP-based drug delivery systems over alternatives.\n\nBeyond raw material expenses, LNPs are recognized as \"less expensive\" overall compared to polymeric and inorganic alternatives <Paper corpusId=\"240262693\" paperTitle=\"(Bukhari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This general cost-effectiveness stems from multiple factors throughout the production process. Kumar et al. specifically highlight \"low production costs\" as a key advantage that makes LNPs preferred over polymeric nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"249916106\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>, while Ashfaq et al. similarly emphasize the \"low production cost\" alongside \"ease of scale-up\" that makes LNPs \"a more preferable option among colloidal carriers\" <Paper corpusId=\"264789329\" paperTitle=\"(Ashfaq et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe economic benefits of LNPs extend to manufacturing efficiency through high drug loading capacity. High drug loading nanoparticles offer advantages such as \"reducing manufacturing cost and increasing production scalability\" <Paper corpusId=\"259383591\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This increased loading capacity means more therapeutic agent can be delivered per unit of carrier material, improving the overall economic efficiency of the formulation.\n\nFrom a resource utilization perspective, LNPs are characterized by \"relatively low production costs, and feasibility for large-scale industrial manufacturing\" <Paper corpusId=\"271997570\" paperTitle=\"(Adamo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261160050\" paperTitle=\"(Mehta et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This simplified manufacturing approach reduces the need for specialized equipment and complex processes that would otherwise increase production costs.\n\nThe economic advantages of LNPs also extend to long-term storage and stability, with research showing they are a \"cost-effective choice for nucleic acid delivery due to their ease of manufacturing and reproducible scale-up procedures\" <Paper corpusId=\"269312598\" paperTitle=\"(Arjunan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248668143\" paperTitle=\"(Sun et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Kinetics of ethanol removal from the inner and outer membranes of LNPs could induce a structural change in the membrane that could lead to fusion of LNPs. However, the effects of microfluidic post-treatment on the final size of LNPs have not been sufficiently understood. Herein, we investigated the effect of the post-treatment processes on the final product size of LNPs in detail. A simple baffle device and a model lipid system composed of a neutral phospholipid (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC) and cholesterol were used to produce the LNPs. We demonstrated that flow conditions of the post-treatment diluting the remaining ethanol in the LNP suspension affected the final product size of LNPs. Based on the findings, we developed an integrated baffle device composed of an LNP production region and a post-treatment region for a microfluidic-based LNP production system; this integrated baffle device prevented the undesirable aggregation or fusion of POPC LNPs even for the high-lipid-concentration condition. Finally, we applied our concept to small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery and confirmed that no significant effects due to the continuous process occurred on the siRNA encapsulation efficiency, biological distribution, and knockdown activity.

The particles consist of DOPE, DOTAP, DOPC and DSPE-PEG(2000) and are assembled with 21 bp double-stranded DNA or small interfering RNA by solvent exchange on a hydrodynamic-focusing microfluidic chip. In comparison to vortex mixing by hand this method increases the encapsulation efficiency by 20%, and yields particles with a narrower size distribution, negligible aggregate formation and high stability in blood plasma and serum. Modification of mNALPs with folate-conjugated PEG-lipids results in specific binding and uptake by epithelial carcinoma KB cells overexpressing folate receptors. Binding is significantly reduced by competitive inhibition using free folate and is not observed with non-targeted mNALPs, revealing high specificity. The functionalized mNALPs show gene silencing in the presence of chloroquine, an endosome-destabilizing agent.
