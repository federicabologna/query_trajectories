One of the most significant applications is photoacoustic (PA) imaging, where SPNs generate stronger signals than commonly used single-walled carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis. This enhanced signal generation allows for whole-body lymph node mapping in living mice with minimal injection doses, demonstrating their efficiency in detecting metastatic spread. <Paper corpusId=\"1454807\" paperTitle=\"(Qian et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4107691\" paperTitle=\"(Pu et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"27676929\" paperTitle=\"(Luk et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe application of SPNs in NIR-II window imaging (1000-1700 nm) represents a significant advancement for deep-tissue tumor detection. Studies have shown that NIR-II PA imaging using SPNs provides approximately 1.5-fold increased signal-to-noise ratio compared to NIR-I excitation, enabling deeper tissue penetration and better contrast in tumor visualization. <Paper corpusId=\"181896308\" paperTitle=\"(Ge et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> This superior imaging depth and contrast have been particularly valuable for brain tumor detection, where SPNs with donor-acceptor systems have demonstrated enhanced PA effects and stability, resulting in nanoparticles that can cross the blood-brain barrier and provide clear PA signals with low toxicity. <Paper corpusId=\"276809915\" paperTitle=\"(Rizwan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nMolecular engineering approaches have further enhanced SPN applications in tumor detection. For instance, fullerene-doped SPNs (SPN-F) amplify PA signals through intraparticle photoinduced electron transfer, enhancing nonradiative heat generation upon light irradiation. In vivo studies demonstrated that mice injected with SPN-F20 exhibited significantly higher PA signals in tumors compared to control groups, illustrating the potential for improved tumor visualization. <Paper corpusId=\"16042807\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206700172\" paperTitle=\"(Lyu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nSPNs have also been successfully employed as reactive oxygen species (ROS) imaging agents, which is particularly valuable for studying various tumor-related pathological processes. Their structural flexibility and narrow PA spectral profiles enable the development of ratiometric PA probes for in vivo real-time imaging of ROS in tumors, strokes, tumor metastasis, bacterial infections, and cardiomyopathy. <Paper corpusId=\"17310914\" paperTitle=\"(Zou et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> This capability provides crucial information about tumor microenvironments and potential treatment responses.\n\nThe versatility of SPNs extends to multimodal imaging approaches. For example, SPNs can be designed with multilayered nanostructures consisting of core SPs, middle silica layers, and outer PEG coronas for enhanced in vivo NIR fluorescence molecular imaging. These multilayered architectures not only enable lymph node tracking but also facilitate sensitive tumor imaging. <Paper corpusId=\"199056735\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> Additionally, SPNs can be functionalized with targeting peptides, such as PT peptide, which facilitates active internalization into specific cancer cells like osteosarcoma, permitting accurate early diagnosis through NIR-II fluorescence and PA signals. <Paper corpusId=\"246066001\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nA particularly innovative application of SPNs is in afterglow luminescence imaging for tumor detection. Phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of approximately 6-7 minutes. This approach avoids tissue autofluorescence, resulting in remarkably high signal-to-background ratios for detecting tumors through thick tissue. <Paper corpusId=\"253276007\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nRecent developments have further expanded SPN applications to include activatable therapeutic and monitoring systems. For instance, SPNs combined with ultrathin manganese oxide nanosheets can generate singlet oxygen by exploiting the elevated acidity in tumors as a trigger. The produced singlet oxygen can excite thiophene-based SPNs to emit photons for near-infrared chemiluminescent imaging, amplifying the generation of singlet oxygen and enabling both tumor detection and treatment. <Paper corpusId=\"221589724\" paperTitle=\"(2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAdvanced SPN-based platforms have also been developed for ultrasound-activated cancer treatment in deep-tissue tumors. These systems utilize SPNs as sonosensitizers to generate singlet oxygen upon ultrasound irradiation, while incorporating other components like ferroptosis inducers to produce hydroxyl radicals. This dual-ROS generating process enables precise regulation of therapeutic agent release within tumors, increasing antitumor efficacy in deep-tissue tumors that are challenging to treat with conventional methods. <Paper corpusId=\"271112887\" paperTitle=\"(Yim et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIn summary, SPNs have transformed deep-tissue tumor detection through their exceptional performance in various imaging modalities, including photoacoustic imaging, NIR-II window imaging, afterglow luminescence imaging, and multimodal approaches.

Although many exogenous contrast agents have been developed for PA imaging and PTT, the design guidelines to amplify their imaging and therapy performances remain challenging and are highly demanded. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) composed of polymers with \u03c0-electron delocalized backbones can be designed to amplify their PA imaging and PTT performance, because of their clear structure-property relation and versatility in modifying their molecular structures to tune their photophysical properties. This review summarizes the recent advances in the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy applications of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a focus on signal amplification and second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700\u00a0nm) construction. The strategies such as structure-property screening, fluorescence quenching, accelerated heat dissipation, and size-dependent heat dissipation are first discussed to amplify the PA brightness of SPNs for in vivo PA. The molecular approaches to shifting the absorption of SPNs for NIR-II PA imaging and PTT are then introduced so as to improve the tissue penetration depth for diagnosis and therapy.

However, some types of cancer exhibited a low response rate to immunotherapy, and the high risk of immune-related side effects has been aroused during immunotherapy, which greatly restrict its broad applications in cancer therapy. Phototherapy that uses external light to trigger the therapeutic process holds advantages including high selectivity and efficiency, and low side effects. Recently, it has been proven to be able to stimulate immune response in the tumor region by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), the process of which was termed photo-immunotherapy, dramatically improving therapeutic specificity over conventional immunotherapy in several aspects. Among numerous optical materials for photo-immunotherapy, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have gained more and more attention owing to their excellent optical properties and good biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize recent developments of SPNs for immunotherapy and imaging of immunoactivation. Different therapeutic modalities triggered by SPNs including photo-immunotherapy and photo-immunometabolic therapy are first introduced.
