First proposed by Jiang and co-workers, the strategy has been subsequently fine-tuned by several authors who demonstrated, by using few selected loci, that the efficiency of mutagenesis (number of mutant colonies over total number of colonies analyzed) can be extremely high (up to 100%). However, from published data it is difficult to appreciate the robustness of the technology, defined as the number of successfully mutated loci over the total number of targeted loci. This information is particularly relevant in high-throughput genome editing, where repetition of experiments to rescue missing mutants would be impractical. This work describes a \"brute force\" validation activity, which culminated in the definition of a robust, simple and rapid protocol for single or multiple gene deletions.ResultsWe first set up our own version of the CRISPR/Cas9 protocol and then we evaluated the mutagenesis efficiency by changing different parameters including sequence of guide RNAs, length and concentration of donor DNAs, and use of single stranded and double stranded donor DNAs. We then validated the optimized conditions targeting 78 \"dispensable\" genes. This work led to the definition of a protocol, featuring the use of double stranded synthetic donor DNAs, which guarantees mutagenesis efficiencies consistently higher than 10% and a robustness of 100%. The procedure can be applied also for simultaneous gene deletions.ConclusionsThis work defines for the first time the robustness of a CRISPR/Cas9-based protocol based on a large sample size.

In previous studies, Cas9 and gRNA were expressed in two plasmids, respectively, as the simultaneous expression would burden the organism metabolism and cause cell death. Hence, Cas9 or gRNA should be repressed before a genome editing event. Cas9 and gRNA can be assembled into one plasmid containing a pBAD promoter, which is repressed by glucose and induced by arabinose and a temperature-sensitive replicon repA101ts, so that transformed E. coli could grow on glucoseamended plates and be edited under the induction with 2 g/L of arabinose. This fast and easy procedure for genome editing could perform continuously, as multiple loci only required one plasmid construction and one step of transformation. To further improve the simultaneous editing efficiency of multiple loci, a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique was developed. The CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique contained three plasmids: pRedCas9 containing both \u03bb-Red recombineering and Cas9 system under the control of pBAD promoter, pMgRNAs containing gRNAs, and pDonorDNAs carrying multiple donor DNA cassettes (Feng et al., 2018)", "Comparing to the previously established system, this optimized system has a higher gene editing efficiency and less operating time, almost 100% for codon replacements and knockout genes within 2 days."], "score": 0.86376953125}, {"id": "(Lacerda et al., 2020)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 227168518, "title": "The Model System Saccharomyces cerevisiae Versus Emerging Non-Model Yeasts for the Production of Biofuels", "year": 2020, "venue": "Life", "authors": [{"name": "M.

A modified method of MAGE was also successfully applied for \u03b2-carotene production in S. cerevisiae (Barbieri et al., 2017). As MAGE generates a vast of combinatorial variants in genome, it could be an effective genome engineering tool only when it is combined with a high-throughput screening (colorimetric or fluorescent) system enabling a selection of variants with desired traits. It is also difficult to incorporate large genetic parts (>1 kb) into genome by MAGE.

The endonuclease Cas9 combined with guide RNA (gRNA) specifically recognizes a target site in genome, and facilitates sitespecific nucleotide base-pair mutations, gene deletions, or large DNA fragment (around 8 kb at least) insertions (Figure 2A). \u03b2-Carotene synthesis pathway was integrated into E. coli genome by CRISPR/Cas9-based method.

A type I-E CRISPR-Cas system has been added to Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a model probiotic, to target and degrade antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and reduce gut microbiome ARG transmission. This change promotes therapeutic efficacy and clinical safety. CRISPR systems are tailored to reduce off-target effects, ensuring therapeutic safety. Beyond Cas9, other Cas proteins like Cas12 have wider protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) compatibility, making probiotic genome targeting more flexible. The diversity of CRISPR-Cas subtypes, including type I and type II systems, expands the toolkit for editing a wide range of probiotic species, supporting the idea of probiotics as \"living therapeutics\" that dynamically respond to host environmental cues."], "score": 0.73486328125}], "table": null}], "cost": 0.5572349999999999}}
