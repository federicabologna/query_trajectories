(LLM Memory)", "text": "\nPhage display is a laboratory technique that uses bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to connect proteins with the genetic information that encodes them. In this approach, foreign DNA fragments are inserted into phage coat protein genes, resulting in the expression of fusion proteins on the phage surface while the genetic information remains packaged inside the phage particle. This physical linkage between genotype and phenotype enables researchers to select phages displaying proteins or peptides with desired binding properties from large libraries containing billions of variants. Traditional phage display screening, introduced in the 1980s, relied on multiple rounds of selection (biopanning) followed by Sanger sequencing of a limited number of individual clones, which provided only a narrow view of the selected library diversity. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nNext-generation sequencing has transformed the landscape of phage display library development and analysis. NGS technologies can sequence millions to billions of DNA fragments simultaneously, allowing researchers to analyze phage display libraries at unprecedented depth and resolution. This integration has enabled the characterization of entire libraries rather than just a few selected clones, providing comprehensive insights into selection dynamics, identifying rare binders that might be lost in conventional approaches, and reducing the number of selection rounds needed. The evolution of NGS platforms from early systems like 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina to more recent technologies such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore has progressively improved read length, accuracy, and throughput, making them increasingly valuable for phage display applications.

We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing.

We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends.

We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH.

Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods.

This strategy effectively filters out \"parasitic sequences\" that can dominate traditional screening methods, reducing false positives and increasing the likelihood of identifying genuine target-binding sequences. <Paper corpusId=\"21565097\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **Enhanced antibody discovery against disease markers**: NGS-based screening of chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries has proven more effective than conventional methods for identifying antibodies against disease markers like prostate-specific antigen (PSA). By analyzing heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences from phage libraries after each round of bio-panning, researchers identified many additional PSA-reactive clones beyond those found through traditional colony screening. The enrichment patterns of HCDR3 sequences throughout the bio-panning process served as positive predictive factors for selecting reactive antibodies. <Paper corpusId=\"2340454\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **Identification of inhibitors for protein-protein interactions**: NGS has been applied to identify peptides targeting specific protein interactions with therapeutic potential. Using the Roche 454 NGS platform, researchers identified over 13,000 peptides targeting ubiquitin and over 10,000 peptides against the ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 from a phage display peptide library. Further validation confirmed peptides that inhibit E3 ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and CHIP, with binding modes characterized by NMR analysis. <Paper corpusId=\"254248125\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) targeting**: NGS-assisted phage display has been successfully applied to target GPCRs, which are important therapeutic targets. In one study, researchers constructed immune VHH libraries and used NGS to identify 34 clusters of specifically enriched sequences against GPCRs. These were functionally assessed using a cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent reporter gene assay, demonstrating the utility of this approach for identifying functional binders to complex membrane proteins. <Paper corpusId=\"265025941\" paperTitle=\"(Zehnaker et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **Large-scale antibody profiling using PhIP-Seq**: Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) combines oligonucleotide library synthesis (OLS), phage display, antibody immunoprecipitation, and high-throughput sequencing to enable efficient large-scale antibody detection. This technique has enhanced the throughput and applicability of phage display for comprehensive antibody profiling, particularly useful for autoimmune disease research and vaccine development. <Paper corpusId=\"272411476\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n- **Reconstruction of rare antibody fragments**: NGS-assisted antibody discovery platforms have been developed to integrate phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries with sequencing technologies. These approaches overcome the read length limitations of NGS by developing methods for linking and sequencing all diversified complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) in phage Fab pools. This enables straightforward conversion of NGS information into functional antibody clones. Notably, reconstructed rare clones with frequencies as low as 0.1% have sometimes shown higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency clones identified by traditional Sanger sequencing, highlighting the value of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery. <Paper corpusId=\"73726420\" paperTitle=\"(Barreto et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>", "citations": [{"id": "(Domina et al., 2014)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 15420021, "title": "Rapid Profiling of the Antigen Regions Recognized by Serum Antibodies Using Massively Parallel Sequencing of Antigen-Specific Libraries", "year": 2014, "venue": "PLoS ONE", "authors": [{"name": "M.

(6 sources)", "text": "\nWhile the integration of next-generation sequencing with phage display has revolutionized antibody discovery, several important limitations persist that researchers are actively working to overcome. One of the most significant challenges has been the read length limitations of second-generation sequencing technologies. As Nannini and colleagues note, \"the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties\" <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation has traditionally forced researchers to sequence only portions of antibody fragments, making the reconstruction of complete antibodies challenging.\n\nAlthough third-generation sequencing technologies like Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and Oxford Nanopore have begun to address these read length constraints, they introduce their own challenges related to error rates, throughput, and cost. Nannini and colleagues demonstrated that SMRT sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation can facilitate \"accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries\" <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, these approaches are still evolving and have not yet fully replaced shorter-read technologies for all applications.\n\nAnother major limitation involves the physical recovery of valuable clones identified through NGS analysis. Zambrano and colleagues highlight that \"to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary\" <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This recovery challenge is particularly acute when dealing with rare binders that may have superior properties but exist at very low frequencies within the library. The process of reconstructing these clones from sequence data remains time-consuming and resource-intensive, creating a bottleneck in the antibody discovery pipeline.\n\nThe complexity of phage output pools presents additional challenges. As observed in phenotypic discovery approaches, \"Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare\" <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"198963158\" paperTitle=\"(Ljungars et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This complexity necessitates complementary \"deep mining\" methods to identify valuable rare clones that might otherwise be overlooked.\n\nBioinformatic analysis of NGS data from phage display libraries also presents significant challenges. The vast amounts of sequence data generated require sophisticated computational approaches to effectively cluster related sequences, identify enrichment patterns, and distinguish genuine binders from background or target-unrelated peptides <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"19585528\" paperTitle=\"(Vodnik et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. As libraries become larger and more diverse, these computational challenges will continue to grow, requiring more advanced algorithms and increased computing resources.\n\nLooking toward the future, several promising directions are emerging to address these limitations. The continued development of long-read sequencing technologies is expected to further improve the ability to characterize full-length antibody constructs. Wei and colleagues suggest that \"characterization of full length VH-VL constructs using synthetic long read assemblies of short read next-generation sequencing data has emerged as a powerful approach to identify antibody candidates with greater speed and sensitivity than classical screening methods\" <Paper corpusId=\"248754302\" paperTitle=\"(Wei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These synthetic long-read approaches may offer a compromise between the throughput advantages of short-read technologies and the length benefits of third-generation platforms.\n\nAdvances in bioinformatics tools tailored specifically for antibody discovery are also expected to address computational bottlenecks. These tools will likely incorporate machine learning approaches to better predict binding properties from sequence data, potentially reducing the need for extensive experimental validation of all candidate binders <Paper corpusId=\"272630189\" paperTitle=\"(Cui et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNew deep mining strategies are being developed to more effectively identify rare but valuable binders from complex phage pools. These include techniques such as depletion of dominant binders, blocking of known epitopes during selection, and targeted enrichment of specific subpopulations <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"198963158\" paperTitle=\"(Ljungars et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Such approaches may help to overcome the bias toward abundant clones that often occurs in traditional screening methods.\n\nIntegration of multiple technological platforms is another promising direction. The combination of phage display with other display technologies (such as yeast or bacterial display), along with complementary screening methods like flow cytometry, may provide more comprehensive coverage of the potential binding space <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nThe future of phage display will likely involve increasingly sophisticated library designs informed by structural biology and computational modeling. These approaches may help to create more focused libraries with greater functional diversity, potentially addressing some of the biases observed in current libraries <Paper corpusId=\"272630189\" paperTitle=\"(Cui et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the integration of NGS data with other omics approaches, such as proteomics and structural data, may provide deeper insights into antibody-antigen interactions and guide more efficient library design and screening strategies <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nAs these technological advances continue to mature, phage display combined with NGS is poised to play an increasingly important role in therapeutic antibody discovery, vaccine development, and basic research into protein-protein interactions.

Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and show that a combination of conventional screening and deep mining methods are needed to fully utilize such pools. Deep mining will be important in future phenotypic antibody drug discovery efforts to increase the diversity of identified antibodies and targets."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Vodnik et al., 2011)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 19585528, "title": "Phage Display: Selecting Straws Instead of a Needle from a Haystack", "year": 2011, "venue": "Molecules", "authors": [{"name": "M.

The power of this method lies in its ability to efficiently and rapidly identify ligands with a desired target property from a large population of phage clones displaying diverse surface peptides. However, the search for the needle in the haystack does not always end successfully. False positive results may appear. Thus instead of specific binders phage with no actual affinity toward the target are recovered due to their propagation advantages or binding to other components of the screening system, such as the solid phase, capturing reagents, contaminants in the target sample or blocking agents, rather than the target. Biopanning experiments on different targets performed in our laboratory revealed some previously identified and many new target-unrelated peptide sequences, which have already been frequently described and published, but not yet recognized as target-unrelated. Distinguishing true binders from false positives is an important step toward phage display selections of greater integrity.
