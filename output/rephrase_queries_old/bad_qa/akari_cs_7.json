As LLMs have grown in capabilities, ensuring they are aligned with human values has become increasingly important. The alignment process typically aims to make models helpful (providing useful information), harmless (avoiding generating harmful content), and honest (being truthful and admitting uncertainty when appropriate). <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe most common technique for alignment is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which involves three key steps: (1) collecting human preferences on model outputs, (2) training a reward model based on these preferences, and (3) optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning to maximize this reward function. Other alignment methods include Constitutional AI, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on carefully curated instruction datasets. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe alignment challenge arises because the objective we optimize during training (typically next-token prediction) doesn't inherently capture the complex human values we want these systems to embody. This creates a gap between what models learn to do well (predict tokens) and what we actually want them to do (be helpful, harmless, and honest in a way that aligns with human intentions). <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">", "citations": [], "table": null}, {"title": "Definition of Superficial Alignment Hypothesis", "tldr": "The Superficial Alignment Hypothesis suggests that alignment processes don't teach language models new knowledge or capabilities, but rather teach them which output formats and styles to use when interacting with users.
