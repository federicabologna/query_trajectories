This phenomenon occurs when the codon usage of the mRNA coding for the foreign protein differs from that of the bacterium. The ribosome pauses upon encountering a rare codon and may detach from the mRNA, thereby the yield of protein expression is reduced. Several bacterial strains have been engineered to overcome this effect. However, the increased rate of translation may lead to protein misfolding and insolubilization. In order to prove this assumption, the solubility of several recombinant proteins from plants was studied in a codon bias-adjusted E. coli strain.ResultsThe expression of eight plant proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS and BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL was systematically studied. The CodonPlus strain contains extra copies of the argU, ileY, and leuW tRNA genes, which encode tRNAs that recognize the codons AGA/AGG, AUA and CUA, respectively (RIL codons). The level of expression and solubility of the recombinant proteins were analyzed by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. We found that for all proteins the solubility was at least 25% in the BL21(DE3)-pLysS strain. However, when expressed in the BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL strain, proteins having more than 5% of amino acids coded by RIL codons were localized mainly in the insoluble fraction. Also, their expression caused retarded growth and low cell yield in the codon bias-adjusted strain at all temperatures tested. On the contrary, the solubility of proteins containing less than 5% of amino acids coded by RIL codons remained unchanged in both strains and their expression caused no effect on cell growth.ConclusionOur results show that the expression of heterologous proteins coded by high RIL codon content coding sequences in a codon bias-adjusted strain is detrimental for their solubility. Our data support the hypothesis that the possible elimination of translational pauses that increase translation rate leads to protein misfolding and aggregation.

This phenomenon occurs when the codon usage of the mRNA coding for the foreign protein differs from that of the bacterium. The ribosome pauses upon encountering a rare codon and may detach from the mRNA, thereby the yield of protein expression is reduced. Several bacterial strains have been engineered to overcome this effect. However, the increased rate of translation may lead to protein misfolding and insolubilization. In order to prove this assumption, the solubility of several recombinant proteins from plants was studied in a codon bias-adjusted E. coli strain.ResultsThe expression of eight plant proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS and BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL was systematically studied. The CodonPlus strain contains extra copies of the argU, ileY, and leuW tRNA genes, which encode tRNAs that recognize the codons AGA/AGG, AUA and CUA, respectively (RIL codons). The level of expression and solubility of the recombinant proteins were analyzed by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. We found that for all proteins the solubility was at least 25% in the BL21(DE3)-pLysS strain. However, when expressed in the BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL strain, proteins having more than 5% of amino acids coded by RIL codons were localized mainly in the insoluble fraction. Also, their expression caused retarded growth and low cell yield in the codon bias-adjusted strain at all temperatures tested. On the contrary, the solubility of proteins containing less than 5% of amino acids coded by RIL codons remained unchanged in both strains and their expression caused no effect on cell growth.ConclusionOur results show that the expression of heterologous proteins coded by high RIL codon content coding sequences in a codon bias-adjusted strain is detrimental for their solubility.

Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli is the popular choice, especially within the research community. While there is an ever growing demand for new expression strains, few strains are dedicated to post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation. Thus, new protein expression strains must be engineered and the parameters involved in producing disulfide bonded proteins must be understood.ResultsWe have engineered a new E. coli protein expression strain named SHuffle, dedicated to producing correctly disulfide bonded active proteins to high yields within its cytoplasm. This strain is based on the trxB gor suppressor strain SMG96 where its cytoplasmic reductive pathways have been diminished, allowing for the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm. We have further engineered a major improvement by integrating into its chromosome a signal sequenceless disulfide bond isomerase, DsbC. We probed the redox state of DsbC in the oxidizing cytoplasm and evaluated its role in assisting the formation of correctly folded multi-disulfide bonded proteins. We optimized protein expression conditions, varying temperature, induction conditions, strain background and the co-expression of various helper proteins. We found that temperature has the biggest impact on improving yields and that the E. coli B strain background of this strain was superior to the K12 version. We also discovered that auto-expression of substrate target proteins using this strain resulted in higher yields of active pure protein. Finally, we found that co-expression of mutant thioredoxins and PDI homologs improved yields of various substrate proteins.ConclusionsThis work is the first extensive characterization of the trxB gor suppressor strain.

This strain is based on the trxB gor suppressor strain SMG96 where its cytoplasmic reductive pathways have been diminished, allowing for the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm.

Several toxins of this bacteria are components of different candidate vaccines, and have been considered as important factors in pathogenesis of NE. A fusion subunit protein composed of immunodominant segments of NetB, Alpha-toxin and metallopeptidase proteins (NAM) was designed. The high level production of NE subunit vaccine candidate is important for the in vitro and in vivo evaluation and later to decrease the production costs. Therefore, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used for optimizing E. coli culture condition. To this end, induction conditions including cell optical density prior induction (OD600nm), IPTG concentration, post-induction temperature and time were modified. The statistical analysis revealed that all variables except IPTG had significant effects on production and solubility of rNAM. A 7.39 fold increase in production of soluble rNAM was achieved when the post induction temperature, IPTG concentration, the pre-induction OD and time were 19 oC, 0.55 mM, 0.8 respectively in 8 h after induction. Our study indicated that the RSM method is a simple and superior strategy for protein expression improvement which is considered as a major limitation in production of vaccine candidate and other recombinant proteins using different hosts. INTRODUCTION Necrotic enteritis (NE) is caused by clostridium perfringens type A, an anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Several virulence factors are involved in disease induction in chickens. In recent years protein based subunit vaccines have provided a safe and most attractive technology for protection against multifactorial disease like NE [10, 34]. Previous studies demonstrated that immunizing ability for protection against NE was associated with several virulence factors. The most important of these virulence factors are phospholipase C known as Alpha-toxin, \u03b2-pore forming toxin, NetB, and a zinc metallopeptidase protein [7,8, 28]. Utilizing a fusion of non toxic variants of these proteins as a recombinant subunit vaccine candidate could enhance protective immunity [31, 6].

Their wider use has shown that the controlled diet not only provides a solution to obtain significantly higher cell yields, but also in many cases folding of the target protein is improved by the applied lower growth rates; i.e. final volumetric yields for the active protein can be a multiple of what is obtained in complex medium cultures."], "score": 0.97705078125}, {"id": "(Mitchell et al., 2021)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 237677625, "title": "Recombinant Protein Production with Escherichia coli in Glucose and Glycerol Limited Chemostats", "year": 2021, "venue": "Applied microbiology", "authors": [{"name": "A.

There is a wealth of knowledge and comprehensive tools for E. coli systems, such as expression vectors, production strains, protein folding and fermentation technologies that are well tailored for industrial applications. Hence, with its recent advancements, the use of E. coli has been a preferred choice and a workhorse not only for expression of non-glycosylated proteins in the biotech industry, but also a complex protein production, bacterial N-linked glycosylation, novel strain engineering and creation of E. coli cell-free systems (Huang et al., 2012). Varieties of promoters are used in the production of recombinant proteins. Some of the strong promoters are induced by isopropyl-\u03b2-Dthiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) (i.e. tac, trc, and lac), which however has been reported to the limitation of its toxicity for the host cells and also causing an ineffective production cost due to its expensiveness [1](Huang et al., 2012)(Retnoningrum et al., 2019)(Briand et al., 2016)."], "score": 0.9755859375}, {"id": "(Briand et al., 2016)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 3385557, "title": "A self-inducible heterologous protein expression system in Escherichia coli", "year": 2016, "venue": "Scientific Reports", "authors": [{"name": "L.
