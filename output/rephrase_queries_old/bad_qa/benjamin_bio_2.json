These include automated systems that combine size and zeta potential measurements with spectroscopic techniques for payload quantification and integrity assessment. The industry is also developing real-time monitoring tools that can be integrated into manufacturing processes, allowing for continuous quality verification rather than end-point testing.\n\nAnother significant trend is the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze complex analytical data sets from LNP characterization. These computational approaches can identify subtle patterns and correlations between manufacturing parameters and final product attributes that might not be apparent through conventional data analysis.\n\nAdvanced imaging techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy and super-resolution microscopy, are increasingly being employed to visualize LNP structural details and payload distribution within nanoparticles. These techniques provide valuable insights into the relationship between LNP structure and function that complement the quantitative data obtained from chromatographic and spectroscopic methods.\n\nThe development of these innovative analytical approaches reflects the industry's recognition that ensuring LNP integrity and stability requires comprehensive, non-destructive assessment methods. As LNP-based therapeutics continue to expand beyond vaccines into areas such as protein replacement therapy and gene editing, these advanced analytical tools will play an increasingly critical role in their development and quality control. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">", "citations": [{"id": "(Maurer et al., 2025)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 277462761, "title": "Proof of Concept Application of Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography for Direct Online Disruption of Lipid Nanoparticles, Intact mRNA Analysis, and Measure of Encapsulation Efficiency", "year": 2025, "venue": "Analytical Chemistry", "authors": [{"name": "Jonathan Maurer", "authorId": "2333603765"}, {"name": "Matthew Lauber", "authorId": "2282166435"}, {"name": "S.

Currently, evaluating key CQAs, such as mRNA integrity and encapsulation efficiency, often involves a labor-intensive manual extraction protocol, which requires LNP disruption prior to analysis. However, these additional offline steps contribute to mRNA degradation and measurement uncertainties, highlighting the urgent need for rapid and effective methods capable of performing an online LNP disruption.
