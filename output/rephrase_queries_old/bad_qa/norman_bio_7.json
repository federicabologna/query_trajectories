By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes.

However, a growing number of next-generation biotherapeutics, such as bi-specific antibodies and fusion proteins, are difficult to express using standard fed-batch processes. Decoupling cell growth and biotherapeutic production is becoming an increasingly desired strategy for the biomanufacturing industry, especially for difficult-to-express products. Cells are grown to a high cell density in the absence of recombinant protein production (the growth phase), then expression of the recombinant protein is induced and cell proliferation halted (the production phase), usually by combining an inducible gene expression system with a proliferation control strategy. Separating the growth and production phases allows cell resources to be more efficiently directed toward either growth or production, improving growth characteristics and enhancing the production of difficult to express proteins."], "score": 0.74853515625}, {"id": "(Sewell et al., 2019)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 267845612, "title": "Enhancing the functionality of a microscale bioreactor system as an industrial process development tool for mammalian perfusion culture", "year": 2019, "venue": "Biotechnology and Bioengineering", "authors": [{"name": "David Sewell", "authorId": "143676624"}, {"name": "Richard Turner", "authorId": "2285689895"}, {"name": "Ray Field", "authorId": "2285689784"}, {"name": "William Holmes", "authorId": "153388694"}, {"name": "Rahul Pradhan", "authorId": "2285666236"}, {"name": "Christopher Spencer", "authorId": "2053087527"}, {"name": "Stephen G Oliver", "authorId": "2285692448"}, {"name": "Nigel KH Slater", "authorId": "2285678419"}, {"name": "Duygu Dikicioglu", "authorId": "1974615"}], "n_citations": 16}, "snippets": ["Since the approval of the first licensed monoclonal antibody (mAb) in 1986, the demand for mAbs as therapeutic agents has developed into a multi-billion dollar per year market (Liu, 2014).

By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge.

In addition to monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, multispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates, as the derivatives of monoclonal antibodies, should also be assessed for developability. Moreover, we propose that the criterion of developability is relative: expected clinical indication, and the dosage and administration route of the antibody could affect this criterion. We also recommend a general screening process during the early discovery stage of antibody-derived therapeutics.

Bioprocessing f luids are processed incrementally, piped as a bolus or transferred via vessels from one process and piece of equipment to the next. This continues to work well, including a number of technological advances resulting in improvements that continue to make bioprocessing more efficient. Upstream and overall process yields are essentially doubling about every five years, with this largely driven by improved cell lines, expression systems and genetic engineering, culture media, and equipment. Among the technologies now gaining increasing adoption and market share for biopharmaceutical manufacture is continuous (bio) processing, with perfusion currently the leading technology, in terms of adoption. The use of incremental, one-step-at-a-time, classic batch processing in biopharmaceutical manufacture is different than most other major products manufacturing and high-tech industries, where processing is generally more continuous. In this context, the move toward more continuous processing in manufacturing is a common characteristic of industries starting to reach maturity. Continuous processing is exemplified by assembly lines, and petroleum refining with processing involving a rather continuous flow of the material being manufactured from one unit operation to the next. Continuous processing generally follows and eventually replaces incremental manufacturing. Continuous processing generally requires more process knowledge, equipment and technological advances than incremental manufacturing. Successful adoption of continuous processing by any industry requires each of the component processes involved to be more integrated, at least with the next process. Continuous processing requires a sufficient critical mass of technological competencies and available equipment capable of supporting process integration. For example, implementing continuous bioprocessing, such as upstream perfusion, is not practical if the next and following steps are unable to handle this output. This article reviews and details some of the key advances and trends in the bioprocessing industry that have emerged which are creating greater adoption and potential for continuous processing as the industry matures.
