This \"stability paradox\" represents one of the most critical challenges in ADC development. Early-generation ADCs often suffered from linker instability issues that led to premature payload release in circulation, resulting in off-target toxicity and reduced efficacy. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe chemical composition of linkers varies widely, with common classifications including cleavable linkers (such as acid-sensitive hydrazones, enzyme-sensitive peptides, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (such as thioether bonds). Each type offers distinct advantages and limitations regarding stability, release kinetics, and payload delivery efficiency. The selection of an appropriate linker chemistry depends on multiple factors including the antibody properties, payload characteristics, and the physiological environment of the target tissue. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nAdvanced linker technologies have emerged to address specific challenges, including branched linkers that enable higher drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) without compromising stability, and self-immolative spacers that facilitate efficient payload release after initial cleavage events.

There was no measurable systemic drug release from this ADC for 2 weeks postadministration in mice. In order to assess the impact of improving linker stability beyond mc containing ADCs, a series of mc and bac-linked 1F6-MMAF conjugates were compared for tolerability, intratumoral drug delivery, and therapeutic efficacy in nude mice with renal cell carcinoma xenografts. There were no statistically significant efficacy differences between sets of mc and bac containing ADCs, although the bac linker technology led to 25% higher intratumoral drug exposure over a 7 day period compared to the corresponding mc linker.

Despite the efficacy of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, concurrent chemotherapy is still needed to maximize response. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of therapeutics that combines an antigen-specific antibody backbone with a potent cytotoxic payload, resulting in an improved therapeutic index. Two anti-HER2 ADCs have been approved by the FDA with different indications in HER2-positive breast cancer. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was the first-in-class HER2-targeting ADC, initially approved in 2013 for metastatic patients who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, and the label was expanded in 2019 to include adjuvant treatment of high-risk patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based therapy. In 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) was the second approved ADC for patients who had received at least 2 lines of anti-HER2-based therapy in the metastatic setting. The success of these two agents has transformed the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer and has re-energized the field of ADC development. Given their advanced pharmaceutical properties, next-generation HER2-targeted ADCs have the potential to be active beyond traditional HER2-positive breast cancer and may be effective in cells with low expression of HER2 or ERBB2 mutations, opening a spectrum of new possible clinical applications. Ongoing challenges include improving target-specificity, optimizing the toxicity profile, and identifying biomarkers for patient selection.
