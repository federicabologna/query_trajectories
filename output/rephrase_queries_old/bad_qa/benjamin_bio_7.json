This disease can be treated by either insulin injection or islet transplantation. Islet transplantation is considered as a better treatment for T1D patients, because islets can produce and release insulin at the appropriate time, resulting in tight blood glucose control. However, islet transplantation is performed only for brittle T1D patients due to lack of sufficient donors: only 1 of 333 patients with insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) can obtain human islets (Frank et al., 2005). Porcine insulin has been applied to treat T1D. Recently, pig islets have also proved to be an attractive alternative resource for solving the donor shortage issue for islet transplantation. Many preclinical trials of porcine islet transplantation have been performed and have already achieved long-term survival of porcine islets in primate recipients (Cardona et al., 2006; Bottino et al., 2014). Previous efforts have been focusing on overcoming rejection of recipients to the donor organs (Bottino et al., 2014). Porcine insulin differs from human insulin by one amino acid (alanine in pigs and threonine in humans) at the carboxy-terminal of the B chain (i.e. position B30) (Sonnenberg and Berger, 1983) (Supplementary Figure S1). This single amino acid difference can induce human antibodies to act against porcine insulin. As a result, the effectiveness is decreased when porcine insulin is used for the longterm treatment of diabetic patients (Clark et al., 1982). For the same reason, the transferred pig islets may not function well in human patients for a long period. To address this issue, here we attempt to generate genetically humanized pigs that produce human insulin rather than porcine insulin. We edited porcine INS (pINS) gene in fibroblasts by using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or CRISPR/Cas9, combined with singlestranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs) as homology donors. By using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology, we successfully generated the genetically modified pigs exclusively expressing human insulin. Gene-editing animals have been generated by injecting the mRNA or proteins of custom endonuclease (such as zinc-finger nuclease, TALEN, and Cas9/gRNA) into one-cell stage embryos, which mostly resulted in mosaicism of the modification. In addition, the genotypes generated by embryo microinjection are variable and unpredictable (Crispo et al., 2015). One or two rounds of further breeding should be performed to obtain desired homozygotes with identical genotype and phenotype, which is particularly time and labor consuming for large animals with long gestation term and sex maturation age, such as pigs. To address this issue, our group has established an approach that employs gene-targeting somatic cells with SCNT, which could generate gene-editing animals with a single and identical mutation by one round of SCNT experiment. Recent reports have demonstrated that ssODNs, which are easily available, are more effective donors than traditional double-strand DNA homology for homology-directed repair (HDR), with the aid of custom endonucleases such as zinc-finger nuclease, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 (Bedell et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013). In addition, when ssODNs are used as HDR donors, selection marker gene is not necessary, which enables to create seamless sitespecific mutations. The success of ssODN-mediated targeting strategy has been reported in cell lines or early stage embryos, but not yet in somatic cells, where homologous recombination with ssODNs is expected to be more difficult due to the limited proliferation competency. The length of ssODNs may affect the HDR efficiency in somatic cells. To optimize the length of ssODNs as donors, a HEK293 cell line with a fluorescence reporter was established, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was mutated by deleting T at 456 site (DEGFP), and thus a stop codon (TATA.TA-A) was created to prevent the EGFP expression. Seven ssODNs with different lengths were used as donors, combined with either TALENs or Cas9/gRNA, to repair DEGFP (Supplementary Figure S2A). Flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine the repairing efficiency (Supplementary Figures S2B and S3). We found that the repairing efficiency increased when the length of ssODNs ranged from (0 + 0) nt to (25 + 25) nt and remarkably decreased when the length of ssODNs reached (30 + 30) nt. However, the repairing efficiency increased again when the length of ssODNs increased from (30 + 30) nt (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S3). It had been reported that when short ssODNs of 15 2 25 nt were used as donors, an alternative genome repair mechanism, i.e. microhomology-mediated end 174 | Journal of Molecular Cell Biology (2016), 8(2), 174\u2013177 doi:10.1093/jmcb/mjw008"], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Liu et al., 2017)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 37671197, "title": "Pig-to-Primate Islet Xenotransplantation: Past, Present, and Future", "year": 2017, "venue": "Cell Transplantation", "authors": [{"name": "Zhengzhao Liu", "authorId": "46270811"}, {"name": "Wenbao Hu", "authorId": "2108026929"}, {"name": "Tian He", "authorId": "2055132176"}, {"name": "Yifan Dai", "authorId": "5587751"}, {"name": "H.

This disease can be treated by either insulin injection or islet transplantation. Islet transplantation is considered as a better treatment for T1D patients, because islets can produce and release insulin at the appropriate time, resulting in tight blood glucose control. However, islet transplantation is performed only for brittle T1D patients due to lack of sufficient donors: only 1 of 333 patients with insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) can obtain human islets (Frank et al., 2005). Porcine insulin has been applied to treat T1D. Recently, pig islets have also proved to be an attractive alternative resource for solving the donor shortage issue for islet transplantation. Many preclinical trials of porcine islet transplantation have been performed and have already achieved long-term survival of porcine islets in primate recipients (Cardona et al., 2006; Bottino et al., 2014). Previous efforts have been focusing on overcoming rejection of recipients to the donor organs (Bottino et al., 2014). Porcine insulin differs from human insulin by one amino acid (alanine in pigs and threonine in humans) at the carboxy-terminal of the B chain (i.e. position B30) (Sonnenberg and Berger, 1983) (Supplementary Figure S1). This single amino acid difference can induce human antibodies to act against porcine insulin. As a result, the effectiveness is decreased when porcine insulin is used for the longterm treatment of diabetic patients (Clark et al., 1982). For the same reason, the transferred pig islets may not function well in human patients for a long period. To address this issue, here we attempt to generate genetically humanized pigs that produce human insulin rather than porcine insulin. We edited porcine INS (pINS) gene in fibroblasts by using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or CRISPR/Cas9, combined with singlestranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs) as homology donors. By using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology, we successfully generated the genetically modified pigs exclusively expressing human insulin. Gene-editing animals have been generated by injecting the mRNA or proteins of custom endonuclease (such as zinc-finger nuclease, TALEN, and Cas9/gRNA) into one-cell stage embryos, which mostly resulted in mosaicism of the modification. In addition, the genotypes generated by embryo microinjection are variable and unpredictable (Crispo et al., 2015). One or two rounds of further breeding should be performed to obtain desired homozygotes with identical genotype and phenotype, which is particularly time and labor consuming for large animals with long gestation term and sex maturation age, such as pigs. To address this issue, our group has established an approach that employs gene-targeting somatic cells with SCNT, which could generate gene-editing animals with a single and identical mutation by one round of SCNT experiment. Recent reports have demonstrated that ssODNs, which are easily available, are more effective donors than traditional double-strand DNA homology for homology-directed repair (HDR), with the aid of custom endonucleases such as zinc-finger nuclease, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 (Bedell et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013). In addition, when ssODNs are used as HDR donors, selection marker gene is not necessary, which enables to create seamless sitespecific mutations. The success of ssODN-mediated targeting strategy has been reported in cell lines or early stage embryos, but not yet in somatic cells, where homologous recombination with ssODNs is expected to be more difficult due to the limited proliferation competency. The length of ssODNs may affect the HDR efficiency in somatic cells. To optimize the length of ssODNs as donors, a HEK293 cell line with a fluorescence reporter was established, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was mutated by deleting T at 456 site (DEGFP), and thus a stop codon (TATA.TA-A) was created to prevent the EGFP expression. Seven ssODNs with different lengths were used as donors, combined with either TALENs or Cas9/gRNA, to repair DEGFP (Supplementary Figure S2A). Flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine the repairing efficiency (Supplementary Figures S2B and S3). We found that the repairing efficiency increased when the length of ssODNs ranged from (0 + 0) nt to (25 + 25) nt and remarkably decreased when the length of ssODNs reached (30 + 30) nt. However, the repairing efficiency increased again when the length of ssODNs increased from (30 + 30) nt (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S3). It had been reported that when short ssODNs of 15 2 25 nt were used as donors, an alternative genome repair mechanism, i.e. microhomology-mediated end 174 | Journal of Molecular Cell Biology (2016), 8(2), 174\u2013177 doi:10.1093/jmcb/mjw008"], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Wong et al., 2024)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 273781593, "title": "Status of islet transplantation and innovations to sustainable outcomes: novel sites, cell sources, and drug delivery strategies", "year": 2024, "venue": "Frontiers in Transplantation", "authors": [{"name": "Jordan M.

Epitopes of \u03b11,3Gal are found on the surface of almost all animals, with the significant exception of humans and some primates, and represents the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig to human xenotransplantation and pig to nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation. A collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. led to the generation of Gal1,3-galactosyltransferase geneknockout (GTKO) pigs which do not express Gal (Phelps et al., 2003). This proved to be a major milestone in the advancement of xenotransplantation. While additional xenoantigens have since been discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are recognized as the likely background of choice for eventual clinical translation. The knock-out of Gal, however, did not prevent islet rejection and other gene manipulations were also explored.

However, small animal models are not sufficient to evaluate large-sized products for human use. Thus, an immunodeficient large animal model is necessary in order to properly evaluate the clinical efficacy of human-derived tissue-engineered products, such as artificial grafts. Here we report the development of an immunodeficient pig model, the operational immunodeficient pig (OIDP), by surgically removing the thymus and spleen, and creating a controlled immunosuppressive protocol using a combination of drugs commonly used in the clinical setting. We find that this model allows the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts. The development of the OIDP is an essential step towards a comprehensive and clinically relevant evaluation of human cell regeneration strategies at the preclinical stage. The development of tissue-engineered vascular grafts heavily relies on the availability of large animal models that allow long-term assessment of graft patency.
