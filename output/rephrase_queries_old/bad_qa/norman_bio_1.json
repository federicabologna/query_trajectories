These nanocarriers typically consist of four key components: ionizable lipids that complex with nucleic acids, helper phospholipids that stabilize the lipid bilayer structure, cholesterol that provides rigidity, and PEGylated lipids that extend circulation time and reduce clearance. When LNPs enter biological fluids such as blood, they immediately encounter a complex environment filled with various proteins and biomolecules. These blood components rapidly adsorb onto the surface of LNPs, forming what is known as the \"biomolecular corona.\" \n\nThe biomolecular corona represents a dynamic layer of proteins, lipoproteins, complement factors, and other biomolecules that surrounds the nanoparticle, effectively creating a new biological identity. This corona formation is not merely a passive coating but rather a competitive and evolving process that depends on both the physicochemical properties of the LNP (such as size, charge, and surface chemistry) and the composition of the biological environment. The corona significantly influences how LNPs interact with cells, tissues, and immune components, often determining their circulation time, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and ultimate therapeutic efficacy. Understanding the mechanisms of corona formation and its composition is therefore essential for designing effective LNP-based therapeutics with predictable in vivo behavior. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">", "citations": [], "table": null}, {"title": "Biomolecular Corona Formation Process", "tldr": "The biomolecular corona forms through a dynamic process where blood components adsorb onto LNP surfaces after PEG-lipid desorption, creating a new biological identity that influences LNP fate.

[85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake.

The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction.

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Akinc et al., 2010)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 47397011, "title": "Targeted Delivery of RNAi Therapeutics With Endogenous and Exogenous Ligand-Based Mechanisms.", "year": 2010, "venue": "Molecular Therapy", "authors": [{"name": "Akin Akinc", "authorId": "5818820"}, {"name": "W.

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks.

The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE).

Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins.
