Traditional antibody production relied on immunizing animals and collecting polyclonal antibodies from their serum or creating hybridomas for monoclonal antibody production. In contrast, recombinant technology uses molecular biology techniques to manipulate antibody genes directly, allowing scientists to clone, modify, and express antibody genes in various host systems. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe foundation of this technology lies in understanding antibody structure - typically consisting of two heavy and two light chains with variable regions that determine antigen specificity. By isolating and manipulating the genes encoding these regions, scientists can create antibodies with customized binding properties, increased stability, reduced immunogenicity, and enhanced effector functions. This genetic engineering approach has overcome many limitations of conventional antibody production methods. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nSince the 1980s, recombinant antibody technology has evolved rapidly, with key developments including the creation of chimeric antibodies (combining human constant regions with mouse variable regions), humanized antibodies (with only the complementarity-determining regions from mouse sources), and fully human antibodies. These innovations significantly reduced the immunogenicity of therapeutic antibodies while maintaining their specificity and efficacy. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe integration of this technology with vaccine development and immunotherapy has been transformative. Recombinant antibodies serve not only as therapeutic agents themselves but also as tools for identifying and validating vaccine targets, enhancing vaccine efficacy, and developing passive immunization strategies.

When reformatted as a scFv, the antibody fragment retained the properties of the parental IgG, including the ability to neutralise virus. Heavy and light chains were sequentially replaced with repertoires of variable domains from non-immunised human donors followed by selection on biotinylated synthetic peptide. All selected variants derived from the same germline as the parental antibody. Variants of the light chain provided little if any improvement, whereas two residue changes in VHCDR2 and one in VHFR3 resulted in a reduced koff from gp120 protein of the MN strain (MNgp120) and synthetic V3 loop peptides as measured by surface plasmon resonance using the BIAcore instrument (Pharmacia Biosensor). VHCDR3 was modified using synthetic oligonucleotides and several clones with reduced koff identified, a number of different substitutions occurring at a single residue position. The residues in the heavy chain identified as reducing koff were simultaneously randomised by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in scFv variants with koff slowed up to sevenfold. Far from compromising recognition of variant loops, binding to these sequences was improved; the koff from synthetic peptides modelled on V3 loop variants being slowed to a degree similar to that observed with MNgp120.

Co-expression of the GP1-heavy chain fusion and the 6D8 light chain using a geminiviral vector in leaves of N.\u00a0benthamiana produced assembled immunoglobulin, which was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation and protein G affinity chromatography. Immune complex formation was confirmed by assays to show that the recombinant protein bound the complement factor C1q.

Fc chains have conserved glycosylation sites at Asn297, with each conjugated to a core heptasaccharide and forming biantennary Fc glycan. The glycans modulate the Fc conformations and functions. It is well known that the antibody Fab and Fc domains and glycan affect antibody activity, but whether these elements act independently or synergistically is still uncertain. We simulated four antibody complexes: free antibody, antigen-bound antibody, FcR-bound antibody, and an antigen-antibody-FcR complex. We found that, in the antibody\u2019s \"T/Y\" conformation, the glycans, and the Fc domain all respond to antigen binding, with the antibody population shifting to two dominant clusters, both with the Fc-receptor binding site open. The simulations reveal that the Fc-glycan-receptor complexes also segregate into two conformational clusters, one corresponding to the antigen-free antibody-FcR baseline binding, and the other with an antigen-enhanced antibody-FcR interaction. Our study confirmed allosteric communications in antibody-antigen recognition and following FcR activation.

This combination has promoted extremely diversified approaches to design nanobody-based constructs suitable for particular applications. Both the format geometry possibilities and the functionalization strategies have been widely explored to provide macromolecules with better efficacy with respect to single nanobodies or their combination. Nanobody multimers and nanobody-derived reagents were developed to image and contrast several cancer diseases and have shown their effectiveness in animal models. Their capacity to block more independent signaling pathways simultaneously is considered a critical advantage to avoid tumor resistance, whereas the mass of these multimeric compounds still remains significantly smaller than that of an IgG, enabling deeper penetration in solid tumors. When applied to CAR-T cell therapy, nanobodies can effectively improve the specificity by targeting multiple epitopes and consequently reduce the side effects. This represents a great potential in treating malignant lymphomas, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma and solid tumors. Apart from cancer treatment, multispecific drugs and imaging reagents built with nanobody blocks have demonstrated their value also for detecting and tackling neurodegenerative, autoimmune, metabolic, and infectious diseases and as antidotes for toxins. In particular, multi-paratopic nanobody-based constructs have been developed recently as drugs for passive immunization against SARS-CoV-2 with the goal of impairing variant survival due to resistance to antibodies targeting single epitopes. Given the enormous research activity in the field, it can be expected that more and more multimeric nanobody molecules will undergo late clinical trials in the next future.
