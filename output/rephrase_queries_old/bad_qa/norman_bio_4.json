Molecular detection methods look for genetic material specific for a given pathogen in a sample usually by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immuno-methods look at the pathogen components (antigens) by antibodies raised against that pathogen specific antigens. There are different variations and products based on these two paradigms with advantages and disadvantages. The third paradigm at least for bacterial pathogen detection entails bacteriophages specific for a given bacterium. Sensitivity and specificity are the two key parameters in any pathogen detection system. By their very nature, bacteriophages afford the best sensitivity for bacterial detection. Bacteria and bacteriophages form the predator-prey pair in the evolutionary arms race and has coevolved over time to acquire the exquisite specificity of the pair, in some instances at the strain level. This specificity has been exploited for diagnostic purposes of various pathogens of concern in clinical and other settings. Many recent reviews focus on phage-based detection and sensor technologies.

Different viral markers can be optimally detected at different stages of infection. Of particular clinical importance is the early identification of infection, which is pivotal for disease management and the development of blood screening assays. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an early surrogate marker of infection and its detection in serum coincides with detectable viraemia. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterise serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind to NS1 for each of the four DENV serotypes. This was achieved using phage display and a subtractive biopanning strategy to direct the antibody selection towards serotype-specific epitopes. This antibody isolation strategy has advantages over immunisation techniques where it is difficult to avoid antibody responses to cross-reactive, immunodominant epitopes. Serotype specificity to recombinant antigen for each of the antibodies was confirmed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Surface Plasmon Resonance. Confirmation of binding to native DENV NS1 was achieved using ELISA and immunofluorescence assay on DENV infected Vero cells. No cross-reactivity with Zika or Kunjin viruses was observed. A previously isolated pan-reactive antibody that binds to an immunodominant epitope was able to pair with each of the serotype-specific antibodies in a sandwich ELISA, indicating that the serotype specific antibodies bind to epitopes which are all spatially distinct from the immunodominant epitope. These antibodies were suitable for use in a multiplexed assay for simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV NS1 in human serum.

Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to monitor both the immobilization and target binding processes. All three techniques show that the binding is specific for TnI as compared to a streptavidin (SA) control. The response curves obtained at TnI concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, using both QCM and EIS, were also compared.

Although the QCM demonstrated a lower LOD as compared to EIS, the latter technique exhibited a larger linear dynamic range than QCM.

Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope. The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones (Zhou et al., 2002).

Here we present a platform where short unstructured peptides that bind to a desired target are selected using M13 phage display. The selected peptides are then chemically synthesized and immobilized on gold, allowing for detection of the target using electrochemical techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is also used as a diagnostic tool during biosensor development. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by creating a novel peptide-based electrochemical biosensor for the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a well-known biomarker of hepatotoxicity. Biopanning of the M13 phage display library over immobilized ALT, led to the rapid identification of a new peptide (ALT5-8) with an amino acid sequence of WHWRNPDFWYLK. Phage particles expressing this peptide exhibited nanomolar affinity for immobilized ALT (Kd,app\u200a=\u200a85\u00b120 nM). The newly identified ALT5-8 peptide was then chemically synthesized with a C-terminal cysteine for gold immobilization. The performance of the gold-immobilized peptides was studied with cyclic voltammetry (CV), QCM, and EIS. Using QCM, the sensitivity for ALT detection was 8.9\u00b10.9 Hz/(\u00b5g/mL) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 60 ng/mL. Using EIS measurements, the sensitivity was 142\u00b112 impedance percentage change %/(\u00b5g/mL) and the LOD was 92 ng/mL. In both cases, the LOD was below the typical concentration of ALT in human blood. Although both QCM and EIS produced similar LODs, EIS is preferable due to a larger linear dynamic range. Using QCM, the immobilized peptide exhibited a nanomolar dissociation constant for ALT (Kd\u200a=\u200a20.1\u00b10.6 nM).

To accommodate the increased interest in biomedical applications of antibodies, antibody phage display technology has provided an alternative for rapid discovery and broad utilisation of novel, highly specific and fully human antibodies (Schirrmann et al., 2011).\n\nSince the introduction of monoclonal antibody technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, antibodies have become important biomolecules due to their capability to be applied in various fields, and most importantly in diagnostic, therapeutics, and vaccine development (Nissim et al., 2008). The potential of applications of na\u00efve antibodies isolated from na\u00efve libraries in diagnostics had been demonstrated in few publications. Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope. The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the highcopy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones (Zhou et al., 2002). These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture (Weimer et al., 2001), electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) (Yu, 1998), and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) (Yu, 1998).\n\nAnother example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143]."], "score": 0.96533203125}, {"id": "(Schirrmann et al., 2011)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 44841738, "title": "Phage Display for the Generation of Antibodies for Proteome Research, Diagnostics and Therapy", "year": 2011, "venue": "Molecules", "authors": [{"name": "T.
