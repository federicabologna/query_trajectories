This tunability is achieved through molecular design and chemical modifications of the polymer structure, enabling optimization for specific biological applications. Additionally, semiconducting polymers can be processed into various nanoformulations such as nanoparticles, nanodots, and nanofibers, which further enhances their utility for in vivo imaging and tumor detection. Their large absorption coefficients, high quantum yields, and ability to function in the NIR window (where biological tissues have minimal light absorption) give them superior performance characteristics compared to many traditional fluorescent probes and biomaterials. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">", "citations": [], "table": null}, {"title": "Optical Properties and Imaging Advantages", "tldr": "Semiconducting polymers offer superior optical properties including high absorption coefficients, tunable absorption/emission wavelengths, and exceptional photostability that make them ideal for tumor detection.

This heightened sensitivity is crucial for early tumor detection when malignant cell populations are small and difficult to visualize with conventional imaging techniques.\n\nA significant advantage of SPs for tumor detection is their excellent performance in the near-infrared (NIR) windows, particularly NIR-I (700-900 nm) and NIR-II (1000-1700 nm), where biological tissues exhibit minimal light absorption and autofluorescence <Paper corpusId=\"251433792\" paperTitle=\"(Men et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

One key advantage is their significantly enhanced photoacoustic (PA) signal generation\u2014SPNs produce stronger PA signals than commonly used imaging agents such as single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, enabling whole-body lymph node mapping in living mice at remarkably low injection doses <Paper corpusId=\"4107691\" paperTitle=\"(Pu et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"265229155\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This superior signal strength translates directly to improved tumor visualization sensitivity, critical for early cancer detection when malignant cell populations are small.\n\nThe effectiveness of SPNs for tumor detection is further enhanced by their absorption properties in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window (1000-1700 nm), where biological tissues exhibit minimal light absorption and reduced scattering. This characteristic enables deep-tissue imaging with unprecedented penetration depths\u2014some SPN formulations have demonstrated PA signal detection through 6.5 cm of chicken breast tissue in vitro, and visualization of structures beneath 5-5.8 cm of tissue in animal models with acceptable signal-to-noise ratios <Paper corpusId=\"244774866\" paperTitle=\"(Ding et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This deep-tissue imaging capability is particularly valuable for detecting tumors in challenging anatomical locations, such as brain tumors, where SPNs have shown effective accumulation and imaging potential upon intravenous injection <Paper corpusId=\"220371348\" paperTitle=\"(Wen et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276809915\" paperTitle=\"(Rizwan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA notable advantage of SPNs is their ability to function as activatable probes that respond to specific tumor microenvironment characteristics. For example, some SPNs have been designed to detect oxygen levels through oxygen-sensitive afterglow imaging, allowing visualization of tiny peritoneal metastatic tumors that are almost invisible to the naked eye <Paper corpusId=\"51922576\" paperTitle=\"(Cui et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

For instance, the incorporation of vinylene bonds into polymer backbones has been shown to significantly increase mass absorption coefficients (by 1.3-fold) and photothermal conversion efficiencies (by 2.4-fold), resulting in stronger PA signals for more sensitive tumor detection <Paper corpusId=\"206718590\" paperTitle=\"(Lyu et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Advances in the design of various diagnostic and therapeutic agents, and the recent trend of utilizing molecules for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications (i.e. theranostics), still have not achieved the maximum benefits of controlling the navigation and biodistribution of these molecules within the biological system. The key challenges towards the use of these agents, from small molecules to macromolecular drugs (e.g. natural, proteins and nucleic acids-based drugs, or synthetic, polymer-based conjugates, carriers or other systems), are, for example, the loss of activity via rapid clearance or degradation, inefficient delivery to the target sites, and inappropriate probing of the disease states, dependent on the particular disease and its location in the body. The concept of nanotechnology has been initiated early in 1959 by Richard Feynman in his famous historical talk at Caltech \"There\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\", with introduction of the possibility of manipulating materials at the atomic and molecular levels.1 In 1974, Norio Taniguchi, at Tokyo University, first utilized the term \"nanotechnology\" referring to the design of materials on the nanoscale.2 In the early 1990\u2019s and until now, the use of nanomaterials of different nature (organic and inorganic), and for various applications (multiple disciplines) has been greatly expanded, in particular, over the last couple of decades.3-4 In the medical field, nanotechnology has emerged to include non-invasive systems for probing of disease and also capable of carrying cargo for localized high concentration delivery, known as \"nanomedicine\", with reduction of off-target effects. The use of nanomaterials, in particular polymeric nanostructures, has demonstrated efficiency in improving delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the target sites, and the feasibility of incorporating several therapeutic/diagnostic/targeting moieties within specific compartments of the nanoparticles, with control of their navigation in the body and to the target sites. Further understanding of the nature and microenvironments of biological systems (e.g. different pH, temperature, permeability, drainage, or overexpressing proteins, enzymes or receptors), and the barriers towards the delivery of various moieties to their destinations, which could be either intra- or extracellular, has aided the design of nanomaterials that could evade the various physiological barriers. Selective delivery to the site of the disease can increase the therapeutic efficacy, imaging contrast and accuracy, reduce adverse reactions, and reduce the dose and cost of medications. \n \nInitially, platform technologies were the target for nanostructure designs, but with the complications of biological systems, it has been recognized over the past decade that disease- and patient-specific medical treatment is needed for efficacy\u2014this review highlights a few examples developed within the past couple of years, with a focus on in vivo studies together with novel designs and significant advances in syntheses. The advantages of polymeric nanostructures over other types of nanomaterials are based upon the flexibility over which their structures can be modified to yield materials of various compositions, morphologies, sizes, surface properties, with possibility of hierarchical assembly of several nanomaterials of various components into one construct that can be accommodated with a variety of therapeutic, diagnostic and/or targeting moieties, within selective compartments of the nanodevices.

Advances in the design of various diagnostic and therapeutic agents, and the recent trend of utilizing molecules for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications (i.e. theranostics), still have not achieved the maximum benefits of controlling the navigation and biodistribution of these molecules within the biological system. The key challenges towards the use of these agents, from small molecules to macromolecular drugs (e.g. natural, proteins and nucleic acids-based drugs, or synthetic, polymer-based conjugates, carriers or other systems), are, for example, the loss of activity via rapid clearance or degradation, inefficient delivery to the target sites, and inappropriate probing of the disease states, dependent on the particular disease and its location in the body. The concept of nanotechnology has been initiated early in 1959 by Richard Feynman in his famous historical talk at Caltech \"There\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\", with introduction of the possibility of manipulating materials at the atomic and molecular levels.1 In 1974, Norio Taniguchi, at Tokyo University, first utilized the term \"nanotechnology\" referring to the design of materials on the nanoscale.2 In the early 1990\u2019s and until now, the use of nanomaterials of different nature (organic and inorganic), and for various applications (multiple disciplines) has been greatly expanded, in particular, over the last couple of decades.3-4 In the medical field, nanotechnology has emerged to include non-invasive systems for probing of disease and also capable of carrying cargo for localized high concentration delivery, known as \"nanomedicine\", with reduction of off-target effects. The use of nanomaterials, in particular polymeric nanostructures, has demonstrated efficiency in improving delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the target sites, and the feasibility of incorporating several therapeutic/diagnostic/targeting moieties within specific compartments of the nanoparticles, with control of their navigation in the body and to the target sites. Further understanding of the nature and microenvironments of biological systems (e.g. different pH, temperature, permeability, drainage, or overexpressing proteins, enzymes or receptors), and the barriers towards the delivery of various moieties to their destinations, which could be either intra- or extracellular, has aided the design of nanomaterials that could evade the various physiological barriers. Selective delivery to the site of the disease can increase the therapeutic efficacy, imaging contrast and accuracy, reduce adverse reactions, and reduce the dose and cost of medications. \n \nInitially, platform technologies were the target for nanostructure designs, but with the complications of biological systems, it has been recognized over the past decade that disease- and patient-specific medical treatment is needed for efficacy\u2014this review highlights a few examples developed within the past couple of years, with a focus on in vivo studies together with novel designs and significant advances in syntheses.

To reduce side effects, protherapeutic agents that can be activated by overexpressed cancer biomarkers are under development. However, these agents still face certain extent of off-target activation in normal tissues, stimulating the interest to design external-stimuli activatable protherapeutics. In this regard, photoactivatable protherapeutic agents have been utilized for cancer treatments. However, because of the intrinsic features of photolabile moieties, most photoactivatable protherapeutic agents only respond to ultraviolet-visible light, limiting their in vivo applications. Thus, protherapeutic agents that can be activated by near-infrared (NIR) light with minimal phototoxicity and increased tissue penetration are highly desired. In this Account, we summarize our semiconducting polymer nanomaterials (SPNs) as NIR photoactivatable protherapeutic agents for cancer treatment. SPNs are transformed from \u03c0-conjugated polymers that efficiently convert NIR light into heat or singlet oxygen (1O2). With photothermal and photodynamic properties, SPNs can be directly used as photomedicine or serve as light transducers to activate heat or 1O2-responsive protherapeutic agents. The heat-activatable SPN-based protherapeutic agents are developed by loading or conjugating of SPNs with therapeutic agents (e.g., agonist, gene, and enzyme). For instance, photothermally triggered release of agonists specifically activates certain protein ion channels on the cellular membrane, leading to ion overinflux induced mitochondria dysfunction and consequently apoptosis of cancer cells. Moreover, photothermal activation of temperature-sensitive bromelain can promote the in situ degradation of collagens (the major components of extracellular matrix), resulting in an improved accumulation of agents in tumor tissues and thus amplified therapeutic outcome. The 1O2-activatable SPN-based protherapeutic agents are constructed through covalent conjugation of SPNs with caged therapeutic agents via hypoxia- or 1O2-cleavable linkers. Upon NIR photoirradiation, SPNs consume oxygen to generate 1O2, which leads to photodynamic therapy (PDT), and meanwhile breaks hypoxia- or 1O2-cleavable linkers for on-demand release and in situ activation of caged protherapeutic molecules (e.g., chemodrug, enzyme, and inhibitor). Such remote activation of SPN-based protherapeutic agents can be applied to induce DNA damage, ribonucleic acid degradation, inhibition of protein biosynthesis, or immune system activation in tumors of living animals. By synergizing PDT with NIR photoactivation of those biological actions, these protherapeutic agents effectively eliminate tumors and even fully inhibit tumor metastasis.

This multimodal functionality is particularly valuable for improving diagnostic accuracy, as different imaging techniques can compensate for the limitations of individual modalities while providing synergistic information about tumor biology.\n\nThe integration of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities within a single SPN platform represents a significant advancement over traditional tumor detection materials. These theranostic nanoagents combine imaging functionality with therapeutic modalities such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), enabling simultaneous tumor detection and treatment <Paper corpusId=\"246066001\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This multimodal functionality from a single nanoplatform represents a significant advantage over conventional imaging materials that typically provide only single-mode visualization.\n\nThe theranostic capabilities of SPNs have been further enhanced through biomimetic targeting approaches. For instance, activated fibroblast cell membrane-coated SPNs (AF-SPNs) specifically target cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment, leading to enhanced tumor accumulation and stronger NIR fluorescence and PA signals compared to uncoated counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"254688030\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"51909178\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.

These biodegradable SPNs can be cleared through renal and hepatobiliary pathways after fulfilling their imaging and therapeutic functions, minimizing long-term accumulation in the body <Paper corpusId=\"271282317\" paperTitle=\"(Neelamraju et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"58648939\" paperTitle=\"(Jiang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Such biomimetic nanocamouflages comprise a near-infrared (NIR) absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN) coated with the cell membranes of activated fibroblasts. The homologous targeting mechanism allows the activated fibroblast cell membrane coated SPN (AF-SPN) to specifically target cancer-associated fibroblasts, leading to enhanced tumor accumulation relative to the uncoated and cancer cell membrane coated counterparts after systemic administration in living mice. As such, AF-SPN not only provides stronger NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic signals to detect tumors but also generates enhanced cytotoxic heat and singlet oxygen to exert combinational photothermal and photodynamic therapy, ultimately leading to an antitumor efficacy higher than that of the counterparts.
