This approach allows surgeons to visualize cancer tissues with greater accuracy during operations, particularly beneficial when treating complex or hard-to-reach tumors. IGS utilizes various imaging modalities including ultrasound, MRI, CT, PET, and fluorescence imaging to provide real-time feedback during surgical procedures. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe effectiveness of IGS varies significantly based on both cancer type and stage. Certain cancers, such as brain tumors, liver cancer, and prostate cancer, are particularly suitable for image-guided approaches due to their anatomical location or proximity to critical structures. Similarly, the stage of cancer plays a crucial role in determining whether IGS is the optimal treatment choice. Early-stage cancers may benefit from the precision of IGS to completely remove localized tumors while preserving healthy tissue, whereas advanced stages might require IGS as part of a multimodal treatment approach. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe decision to use IGS must be individualized, taking into account the specific characteristics of the cancer, patient factors, and available technology.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of HER2-targeted multimodal imaging using [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW in an orthotopic breast cancer model.MethodsTrastuzumab was conjugated with p-isothiocyanatobenzyl (ITC)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and IRDye800CW-NHS ester and subsequently labeled with 111In. In a dose escalation study, the biodistribution of 10, 30, and 100\u2009\u03bcg [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW was determined 48\u2009h after injection in BALB/c nude mice with orthotopic high HER2-expressing tumors. Also, a biodistribution study was performed in a low HER2-expressing breast cancer model. In addition, multimodal image-guided surgery was performed in each group. Autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemically stained slices of the tumors were compared for co-localization of tumor tissue, HER2 expression, fluorescence, and radiosignal.ResultsBased on the biodistribution data, a 30\u2009\u03bcg dose of dual-labeled trastuzumab (tumor-to-blood ratio 13 \u00b1 2) was chosen for all subsequent studies. [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW specifically accumulated in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 tumors (101 \u00b1 7 %IA/g), whereas uptake in orthotopic low HER2-expressing MCF7 tumor was significantly lower (1.2 \u00b1 0.2 %IA/g, p = 0.007). BT474 tumors could clearly be visualized with both micro-SPECT/CT, fluorescence imaging and subsequently, image-guided resection was performed. Immunohistochemical analyses of BT474 tumors demonstrated correspondence in fluorescence, radiosignal, and high HER2 expression.ConclusionsDual-labeled trastuzumab showed specific accumulation in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 breast tumors with micro-SPECT/CT and fluorescence imaging and enabled image-guided tumor resection. In the clinical setting, [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW could be valuable for preoperative detection of (metastatic) tumors by SPECT/CT imaging, and intraoperative localization by using a gamma probe and fluorescence image-guided surgery to improve radical resection of tumor tissue in patients with HER2-positive tumors."], "score": 0.0}], "table": null}, {"title": "Emerging Technologies and Future Directions", "tldr": "Image-guided surgery is evolving with dual-labeled antibody technologies that combine fluorescent and radioactive markers for more precise tumor visualization and resection.

One significant advancement is the development of dual-labeled antibodies that combine fluorescent and radioactive labels for multimodal imaging. For example, trastuzumab labeled with both IRDye800CW (fluorescent) and 111In (radioactive) has demonstrated specific accumulation in HER2-positive breast tumors, enabling both pre-operative visualization through micro-SPECT/CT imaging and intraoperative guidance during tumor resection. <Paper corpusId=\"238199127\" paperTitle=\"(Naidoo et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"208190966\" paperTitle=\"(Deken et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIn clinical applications, these dual-labeled antibodies could significantly enhance surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to detect tumors preoperatively with SPECT/CT imaging and then precisely locate and remove them intraoperatively using both gamma probes and fluorescence imaging.

For instance, sentinel node (SN) navigation surgery is emerging as a promising less invasive personalized treatment for early-stage esophageal cancer, though further multicenter trials using standardized protocols are still needed to establish its efficacy. <Paper corpusId=\"59410791\" paperTitle=\"(Takeuchi et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> Similarly, for patients with unifocal breast cancer, wire-guided localization (WGL) combined with multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) guided 3D reconstruction techniques are being developed to achieve improved cosmetic outcomes. <Paper corpusId=\"279367129\" paperTitle=\"(Xia et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAdaptive treatment approaches guided by imaging are also showing promise. Researchers have evaluated an image-guided approach to tailor chemotherapy duration based on early response assessment. In this model, response to treatment is monitored every three cycles, and patients achieving radiologic complete response (rCR) are referred for surgery rather than completing a predetermined number of chemotherapy cycles. This approach potentially reduces unnecessary treatment and associated toxicity while maintaining efficacy. <Paper corpusId=\"257326144\" paperTitle=\"(Voort et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIn ovarian cancer management, fluorescence image-guided surgery represents a promising intraoperative guidance technique to improve debulking completeness, which is considered the only modifiable prognostic factor for patients with advanced disease. <Paper corpusId=\"52270092\" paperTitle=\"(Lorenzo et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> This approach could potentially enhance the surgeon's ability to identify and remove microscopic disease that might otherwise be missed with conventional visual and tactile assessment.\n\nRadiation therapy is also evolving with technological advancements that complement surgical approaches. These include intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), radioimmunotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). <Paper corpusId=\"55378429\" paperTitle=\"(Nawab, 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> These technologies allow for more precise targeting of tumors while sparing surrounding healthy tissues, potentially improving both the efficacy and safety profiles of cancer treatments.\n\nAs these emerging technologies continue to develop and undergo clinical validation, they promise to further refine the application of image-guided surgery across different cancer types and stages, potentially expanding treatment options for patients and improving long-term outcomes.", "citations": [{"id": "(Naidoo et al., 2021)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 238199127, "title": "Nanobodies Enhancing Cancer Visualization, Diagnosis and Therapeutics", "year": 2021, "venue": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "authors": [{"name": "D.

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) receptor and dual-labeled trastuzumab with both a fluorophore (IRDye800CW) and a radioactive label (111In) can be used for multimodal imaging of HER2-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of HER2-targeted multimodal imaging using [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW in an orthotopic breast cancer model.MethodsTrastuzumab was conjugated with p-isothiocyanatobenzyl (ITC)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and IRDye800CW-NHS ester and subsequently labeled with 111In. In a dose escalation study, the biodistribution of 10, 30, and 100\u2009\u03bcg [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW was determined 48\u2009h after injection in BALB/c nude mice with orthotopic high HER2-expressing tumors. Also, a biodistribution study was performed in a low HER2-expressing breast cancer model. In addition, multimodal image-guided surgery was performed in each group. Autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemically stained slices of the tumors were compared for co-localization of tumor tissue, HER2 expression, fluorescence, and radiosignal.ResultsBased on the biodistribution data, a 30\u2009\u03bcg dose of dual-labeled trastuzumab (tumor-to-blood ratio 13 \u00b1 2) was chosen for all subsequent studies. [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW specifically accumulated in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 tumors (101 \u00b1 7 %IA/g), whereas uptake in orthotopic low HER2-expressing MCF7 tumor was significantly lower (1.2 \u00b1 0.2 %IA/g, p = 0.007). BT474 tumors could clearly be visualized with both micro-SPECT/CT, fluorescence imaging and subsequently, image-guided resection was performed. Immunohistochemical analyses of BT474 tumors demonstrated correspondence in fluorescence, radiosignal, and high HER2 expression.ConclusionsDual-labeled trastuzumab showed specific accumulation in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 breast tumors with micro-SPECT/CT and fluorescence imaging and enabled image-guided tumor resection. In the clinical setting, [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW could be valuable for preoperative detection of (metastatic) tumors by SPECT/CT imaging, and intraoperative localization by using a gamma probe and fluorescence image-guided surgery to improve radical resection of tumor tissue in patients with HER2-positive tumors."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Takeuchi et al., 2018)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 59410791, "title": "Sentinel node navigation surgery in esophageal cancer", "year": 2018, "venue": "Annals of Gastroenterological Surgery", "authors": [{"name": "H.
