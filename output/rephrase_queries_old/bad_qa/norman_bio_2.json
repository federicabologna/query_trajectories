Understanding the mechanisms underlying liver accumulation is crucial for both optimizing hepatic delivery and developing strategies to overcome this bias for non-hepatic applications.\n\nThe primary mechanism driving LNP liver accumulation involves apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated targeting. After intravenous administration, PEG-lipids with short lipid tails tend to desorb from the LNP surface, allowing blood proteins, particularly ApoE, to adsorb and form a protein corona <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232322928\" paperTitle=\"(Sebastiani et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This physicochemical similarity of LNPs to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) enhances their interaction with ApoE <Paper corpusId=\"268998096\" paperTitle=\"(Rodriguez-Castejon et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have shown that approximately 90% of injected ionizable lipids can be detected in the liver within 4 hours of systemic administration, highlighting the remarkable liver-targeting efficiency of these formulations <Paper corpusId=\"264387007\" paperTitle=\"(Yan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe cellular uptake mechanism in hepatocytes follows a well-defined pathway: ApoE-coated LNPs are recognized by low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on hepatocyte surfaces, triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"238214772\" paperTitle=\"(Kawase et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. Inside endosomes, the acidic environment protonates ionizable lipids such as DLin-MC3-DMA, which destabilizes the endosomal membrane. Combined with the membrane-fusing action of cholesterol, this facilitates endosomal escape, releasing the RNA cargo into the cytoplasm where it can exert its therapeutic effect <Paper corpusId=\"264387007\" paperTitle=\"(Yan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"254671103\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe size of LNPs also influences their distribution within liver cell populations. The diameter of liver fenestrations (50-300 nm) serves as a physiological filter, with LNP size determining whether they preferentially target hepatocytes or cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), including Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, strategically sized LNPs combined with surface modifications, such as mannose grafting, can selectively deliver RNA to LSECs while minimizing uptake by hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nTo overcome the liver accumulation bias for non-hepatic applications, several innovative approaches have emerged. The selective organ targeting (SORT) methodology involves incorporating specific molecules into LNPs to tune delivery to extrahepatic tissues after intravenous administration <Paper corpusId=\"268998096\" paperTitle=\"(Rodriguez-Castejon et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The primary end point was the change from baseline in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, 0 to 304, with higher scores indicating more impairment) at 18 months. Other assessments included the Norfolk Quality of Life\u2013Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL\u2010DN) questionnaire (range, \u20104 to 136, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life), 10\u2010m walk test (with gait speed measured in meters per second), and modified body\u2010mass index (modified BMI, defined as [weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters]\u00d7albumin level in grams per liter; lower values indicated worse nutritional status).

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation.

SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues.

As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo.

Kim et al. demonstrated that LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid content (approximately 68 nm in diameter) exhibited optimal hepatocyte targeting. These smaller LNPs efficiently penetrated liver fenestrations and showed maximum protein expression in hepatocytes. In contrast, increasing the PEG-lipid content beyond 1.5% produced larger LNPs that could not effectively pass through fenestrations, redirecting them to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) instead of hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis size-dependent distribution phenomenon has been leveraged to develop cell-specific targeting strategies within the liver. By combining high PEG-lipid content with surface modifications such as mannose conjugation, researchers have created LNPs that selectively target LSECs while minimizing hepatocyte uptake. The mannose receptor, predominantly expressed on LSECs, provides a mechanism for receptor-mediated endocytosis of these modified LNPs <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor applications requiring extrahepatic delivery, several PEG-based strategies have emerged. While simply increasing PEG-lipid content has not been sufficient to achieve prolonged circulation and redirection to extrahepatic targets, combining PEGylation with targeting ligands has shown promise. For instance, LNPs conjugated with antibodies against vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 or PECAM-1) and CD-4 have successfully redirected LNPs from the liver to the lung, cerebral endothelium, and T cells in both lymph and spleen <Paper corpusId=\"253795111\" paperTitle=\"(Kalita et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAn innovative approach to minimize liver accumulation involves reticuloendothelial system (RES) blockade strategies.

An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."], "score": 0.0}], "table": null}, {"title": "Pre-treatment and RES-Blockade Strategies", "tldr": "Pre-treatment strategies using \"nanoprimers\" can temporarily occupy reticuloendothelial system cells in the liver, reducing LNP clearance and improving therapeutic efficacy for both mRNA and siRNA delivery.

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 247129065, "title": "Anionic Lipid Nanoparticles Preferentially Deliver mRNA to the Hepatic Reticuloendothelial System", "year": 2022, "venue": "Advances in Materials", "authors": [{"name": "Roy Pattipeiluhu", "authorId": "1573589770"}, {"name": "Gabriela Arias-Alpizar", "authorId": "1399158314"}, {"name": "G.

These approaches enable tissue-specific expression patterns even when the LNP predominantly accumulates in the liver.\n\nA particularly promising RNA modification strategy involves the incorporation of hepatic-selective, suppressive microRNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of therapeutic mRNA <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This clever approach exploits the fact that certain miRNAs are highly expressed in specific tissues, including the liver. By incorporating binding sites for liver-enriched miRNAs into the therapeutic mRNA, expression can be selectively suppressed in hepatocytes while remaining active in target tissues where those miRNAs are absent or less abundant. This strategy effectively uses the liver's own regulatory mechanisms to prevent off-target expression while maintaining therapeutic efficacy in the intended tissues.\n\nThis RNA modification approach complements other strategies such as nanoprimer pre-treatment, which physically blocks LNP uptake by reticuloendothelial cells. For instance, research has demonstrated that using liposomal nanoprimers to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance prior to LNP administration results in increased systemic availability of therapeutic RNA and enhanced expression of human erythropoietin mRNA or improved silencing with factor VII siRNA <Paper corpusId=\"250972048\" paperTitle=\"(Kularatne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218480033\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. When combined with miRNA-binding site modifications, these approaches could potentially provide synergistic benefits by both reducing physical accumulation in the liver and suppressing expression in any LNPs that do reach hepatocytes.\n\nUnlike strategies that modify the LNP structure or composition, RNA modification approaches offer the advantage of maintaining the established safety and efficacy profiles of clinically validated LNP formulations while introducing tissue specificity at the genetic level.
