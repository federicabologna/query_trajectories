Here, we present a general and scalable platform entitled \u2018biomolecular implementation of protocellular communication\u2019 (BIO-PC) to engineer distributed multichannel molecular communication between populations of non-lipid semipermeable microcapsules. Our method leverages the modularity and scalability of enzyme-free DNA strand-displacement circuits to develop protocellular consortia that can sense, process and respond to DNA-based messages. We engineer a rich variety of biochemical communication devices capable of cascaded amplification, bidirectional communication and distributed computational operations. Encapsulating DNA strand-displacement circuits further allows their use in concentrated serum where non-compartmentalized DNA circuits cannot operate. BIO-PC enables reliable execution of distributed DNA-based molecular programs in biologically relevant environments and opens new directions in DNA computing and minimal cell technology.Semipermeable proteinosome membranes allow complex DNA message communication through compartmentalization and protect the DNA circuits from degradation in a biological environment."], "score": 0.0}, {"id": "(Young et al., 2010)", "paper": {"corpus_id": 6643227, "title": "Synthetic Biology: Tools to Design, Build, and Optimize Cellular Processes", "year": 2010, "venue": "Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology", "authors": [{"name": "E.
