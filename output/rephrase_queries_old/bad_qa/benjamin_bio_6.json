For maximal intratumoral drug delivery, linkers are required that are highly stable in the systemic circulation, yet allow for efficient drug release at the target site. In this respect, amide bond-based technologies constitute a technological advancement, since the linker half-lives in circulation ( t 1/2 approximately 7 days) are much longer than earlier generation linkers that break down within 1-2 days. The amide linkers, some of which contain peptides, are appended to the mAb carriers through thioether/maleimide adducts. Here, we describe that use of a bromoacetamidecaproyl (bac) in place of the maleimidocaproyl (mc) increases the plasma stability of resulting thioether ADCs. One such ADC, 1F6-C4v2-bac-MMAF, which is directed against the CD70 antigen on lymphomas and renal cell carcinoma, was prepared containing a bac thioether spacer between the drug (MMAF) and the mAb carrier (1F6-C4v2). There was no measurable systemic drug release from this ADC for 2 weeks postadministration in mice. In order to assess the impact of improving linker stability beyond mc containing ADCs, a series of mc and bac-linked 1F6-MMAF conjugates were compared for tolerability, intratumoral drug delivery, and therapeutic efficacy in nude mice with renal cell carcinoma xenografts. There were no statistically significant efficacy differences between sets of mc and bac containing ADCs, although the bac linker technology led to 25% higher intratumoral drug exposure over a 7 day period compared to the corresponding mc linker.

Patients and Methods: This was a phase I, open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study of DLYE5953A administered intravenously every 21 days (Q3W) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies. Results: Sixty-eight patients received DLYE5953A (median, four cycles; range, 1\u201327). No dose-limiting toxicities were identified during dose escalation (0.2\u20132.4 mg/kg; n = 20).

The linker component must strike a delicate balance between maintaining stability in circulation and efficiently releasing cytotoxic payloads at the target site <Paper corpusId=\"263654364\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206539442\" paperTitle=\"(Srinivasarao et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This balance is particularly challenging as existing linker technologies often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity that compromises the therapeutic window <Paper corpusId=\"263654364\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Stability Considerations\n\nA primary design consideration for ADC linkers is stability during preparation, storage, and systemic circulation <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Premature payload release has proven problematic in clinical applications, as demonstrated by gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u00ae), where poor circulation stability of hydrazone linkers resulted in reduced clinical efficacy and safety <Paper corpusId=\"13933508\" paperTitle=\"(Kalim et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. To address this issue, non-cleavable linkers have been developed to prevent premature release in circulation, relying instead on complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the drug with its conjugated amino acid <Paper corpusId=\"13933508\" paperTitle=\"(Kalim et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Conjugation Site Selection\n\nThe conjugation site significantly influences ADC stability during circulation and overall pharmacological activity <Paper corpusId=\"265324669\" paperTitle=\"(Balamkundu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. With numerous site-specific conjugation methods now available, researchers can strategically select optimal attachment points on the antibody <Paper corpusId=\"228079722\" paperTitle=\"(Walsh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Thiol-maleimide Michael addition chemistry remains popular due to its robustness and chemospecificity with either native or engineered cysteine residues <Paper corpusId=\"265324669\" paperTitle=\"(Balamkundu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The importance of conjugation site selection has led to novel approaches such as bioconjugation using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) to assess how site-specific conjugation affects linker stability <Paper corpusId=\"265324669\" paperTitle=\"(Balamkundu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Linker Parameters Optimization\n\nKey linker parameters that require optimization include conjugation chemistry (e.g., maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length, and steric hindrance <Paper corpusId=\"235599751\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195879565\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Precise adjustment of these parameters is essential to achieve the desired balance between stability and payload release efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"263654364\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Addressing Physicochemical Challenges\n\nADC linker design must address several physicochemical challenges, particularly hydrophobicity, aggregation, insufficient drug-loading, and reduced circulatory half-life <Paper corpusId=\"249838184\" paperTitle=\"(Evans et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Researchers have incorporated polymeric components within linker structures to overcome these challenges, focusing on amphiphilic, water-soluble synthetic polymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG) <Paper corpusId=\"249838184\" paperTitle=\"(Evans et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Spacers are often essential extensions of the linker that prevent shielding of the antibody's active site while improving solubility properties of ADCs <Paper corpusId=\"1549757\" paperTitle=\"(Firer et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Release Mechanism Selection\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers represents a fundamental design consideration, driven by the proposed mechanism of action for each specific application <Paper corpusId=\"236174934\" paperTitle=\"(Dean et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Cleavable linkers can be designed to respond to specific environmental factors such as the acidic environment of endosomes and lysosomes, proteases like cathepsin B, or reducing agents like glutathione <Paper corpusId=\"236174934\" paperTitle=\"(Dean et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. For non-internalizing ADCs, drug release relies on extracellular cleavage by glutathione and proteases shed from tumor cell death <Paper corpusId=\"236174934\" paperTitle=\"(Dean et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"207555725\" paperTitle=\"(Perrino et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNon-cleavable linkers, which resist proteolytic degradation and require complete antibody degradation, have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance as the linker-payload complex is no longer a substrate for MDR1 <Paper corpusId=\"236174934\" paperTitle=\"(Dean et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. These linkers must maintain the ADC's stability in the bloodstream while forming an innocuous element after releasing the payload <Paper corpusId=\"271549527\" paperTitle=\"(Perez et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Bystander Effect Considerations\n\nAnother important design consideration is whether the ADC should promote bystander killing. Cleavable linkers can generate membrane-permeable neutral payloads capable of diffusing to neighboring cells, an important factor when targeting heterogeneous tumors <Paper corpusId=\"271549527\" paperTitle=\"(Perez et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This property must be deliberately engineered into the linker design based on the target cancer type and heterogeneity.\n\n## Critical Selection Process\n\nThe selection of appropriate linkers has become increasingly critical after early clinical trial failures, leading to more restricted choices primarily focused on hydrazones, peptides, disulfides, and thioethers <Paper corpusId=\"55679231\" paperTitle=\"(Chauhan et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.
