Recent data have demonstrated that chemical coupling of a Tat-derived peptide (extending from residues 37 to 72) to several proteins allowed their functional internalization into several cell lines or tissues. A part of this same domain can be folded in an \u03b1-helix structure with amphipathic characteristics.

Unexpectedly, the domain extending from amino acid 37 to 47, which corresponds to the \u03b1-helix structure, is not required for cellular uptake and for nuclear translocation. Peptide internalization was assessed by direct labeling with fluorescein or by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody directed against the Tat basic cluster.

Experimental factors, such as head position, volume, and method of administration, and formulation parameters, such as pH, osmolarity, or inclusion of permeation enhancers or mucoadhesives, can influence formulation deposition within the nasal passages and pathways followed into the CNS.

Here we constructed a biomimetic nanocarrier named apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-reconstituted high density lipoprotein nanocarrier (ANC) from recombinant ApoE and synthetic lipids to achieve the above goals. \u03b1-Mangostin (\u03b1-M), a polyphenolic agent that can inhibit the formation of A\u03b2 oligomers and fibrils and accelerate A\u03b2 cellular degradation, was used as the model drug. Compared with the control liposome, ANC demonstrated about 54-fold higher cellular uptake in brain endothelial cell line in vitro in an ApoE-dependent manner and much higher brain delivery efficiency in vivo. Confocal microscopy analysis witnessed the penetration of ANC across the brain vessels and its accumulation at the surrounding of A\u03b2 aggregates. Following the loading of \u03b1-M, the A\u03b2-binding affinity of the nanoformulation (ANC-\u03b1-M) was not reduced but even enhanced.

Following intravenous administration for 2 to 4 weeks, ANC-\u03b1-M exhibited the most efficient efficacy in decreasing amyloid deposition, attenuating microgliosis, and rescuing memory defect in SAMP8 mice, an AD mouse model.
