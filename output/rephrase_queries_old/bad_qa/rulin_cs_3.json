It emerged in 2023 and has rapidly evolved to become one of the leading open-source solutions for visual understanding and reasoning tasks. (LLM Memory)", "text": "\nLLaVA represents a significant advancement in multimodal AI systems by connecting large language models (LLMs) with vision encoders to enable sophisticated understanding and reasoning about visual content. The first LLaVA model was introduced in April 2023 by researchers who aimed to create a simple yet effective multimodal model that could understand and discuss visual information. LLaVA models are typically built by connecting a vision encoder (such as CLIP) with a large language model, creating a system that can process both images and text in an integrated manner. This architecture allows the models to perform various tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, and reasoning about visual content in natural language conversations. LLaVA stands out for its efficiency and strong performance despite its relatively straightforward design, helping democratize access to powerful multimodal AI capabilities through open-source implementations. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">", "citations": [], "table": null}, {"title": "LLaVA Evolution Timeline", "tldr": "The LLaVA model series has rapidly evolved since its initial release in 2023, with each iteration introducing significant improvements in capabilities and performance.
