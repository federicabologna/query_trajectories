Motivation\\n\\nBiomedical discovery today remains throttled by the long turnaround time between a clinician\u2019s research question and delivery of an analysable EHR extract.  Even at data\u2011rich institutions like the University\u202fof\u202fAlabama at Birmingham\u202f(UAB), investigators wait weeks for database developers to interpret requests, craft SQL, check PHI compliance, and generate CSV files that must then be merged with external resources such as MIMIC\u2011III.  The friction slows hypothesis iteration and delays translation of discoveries to the bedside.\\n\\nLarge\u2011language\u2011model (LLM) breakthroughs\u2014especially open\u2011weight models that can run safely behind a firewall\u2014offer a path to disrupt this cycle.  Yet merely dropping an LLM into a clinical stack is insufficient: EHR schemas such as OMOP are highly normalised, governed by strict privacy rules, and constantly evolving.  Without specialised agentic orchestration, an LLM will produce fragile queries, omit provenance, and risk PHI leakage.  AgenticAI addresses these challenges head\u2011on by combining (i) on\u2011premise, high\u2011capacity LLM serving; (ii) an ensemble of purpose\u2011built LangChain agents; and (iii) a first\u2011class privacy layer grounded in differential privacy, federated execution, and Named\u2011Entity\u2011Recognition (NER) redaction.\\n\\n2.

Significance\\n\\nTimely, privacy\u2011compliant access to comprehensive EHR data is a linchpin for precision medicine, real\u2011world evidence studies, and rapid clinical decision support.  Yet the gaps identified above (G1\u2013G5) collectively stall discovery and inflate costs: manual query cycles delay hypotheses; cloud LLM prohibitions deny clinicians modern AI tools; schema ignorance breeds mistrust; and incomplete privacy controls hinder data\u2011sharing collaborations.

LSWT directly influences the formation and mixing of thermal layers within a lake. As the surface warms, the upper layer of water, known as the epilimnion, becomes less dense than the colder, deeper water beneath it, resulting in a separation of layers. This process, called thermal stratification, leads to a more stable epilimnion that resists mixing with the hypolimnion below. The stability of this stratification increases with larger temperature differences, making it more difficult for wind or other forces to mix the water column. Reduced vertical mixing limits the upward transport of nutrients from deeper waters, while allowing more sunlight to reach the surface layer.

Stable Isotope Analysis: \u03b4\u00b9\u00b3C and \u03b4\u00b9\u2078O for carbonate cements \u03b4\u00b3\u2074S and \u03b4\u00b9\u2078O for sulfate minerals \u2078\u2077Sr/\u2078\u2076Sr for fluid source tracing Organic Geochemistry (if accessible): Biomarker analysis (e.g., hopanes, steranes) for microbial activity. Fluid Inclusion Analysis: Estimate temperature and composition of diagenetic fluids. \ufffd\ufffd Study Area & Sample Base Focus on cores from the Seward Member of the Duperow Formation (especially Units with early cementation and anhydrite/celestite presence as per Lake 2004 and Cen & Salad Hersi 2006). \ufffd\ufffd Expected Outcomes A clearer model of early fluid-rock interactions and their diagenetic signatures Identification of microbial versus abiotic processes in cementation and mineralization Insights into reservoir potential in analogous carbonate-evaporite systems A biogeochemical framework that supports future hydrocarbon exploration or CO\u2082 sequestration models", "The biogeochemical evolution of the Duperow Formation, particularly in southern Saskatchewan, remains less well understood due to a lack of significant hydrocarbon production in the region compared to coeval strata like the Leduc reefs of Alberta and the Duperow Formation in North Dakota.

In this study, a Bayesian network is employed to model the carbon emissions of international cereal transportation networks by integrating variables such as transport modes, geopolitical conflict status, trade volumes, and economic indicators (Kucukvar et al., 2014). The network is trained on historical data (2016\u20132021) to identify probabilistic relationships between these variables and predict emissions under varying scenarios (e.g., conflict escalation, shifts to low-emission transport modes) (Smith et al., 2017). Unlike static regression models, BNs dynamically infer how changes in one variable (e.g., trade tariffs, GDP fluctuations) propagate through the network to affect emissions, enabling policymakers to simulate decarbonization strategies (Heckerman et al., 1995).\\n\\nNetwork Structure Learning\\nThe BN structure is learned from data using two complementary approaches (Margaritis, 2003):\\n\\nConstraint-Based Learning: Tests conditional independencies between variables (e.g., whether conflict status and transport mode choice are independent given GDP levels) (Spirtes et al., 2000).

This study introduces a dynamic Bayesian Network (BN) framework to model the probabilistic interdependencies between geopolitical conflict, transport logistics, and carbon emissions across temporal and spatial dimensions. Leveraging structural learning (PC algorithm) and parameterized causal relationships, we analyze country-level data (2016\u20132021) spanning 206 exporting and 169 importing nations, with a focus on cereal trade. Our BN reveals that conflict-driven trade doubles emissions per transaction (6.9M vs. 2.6M kg CO\u2082 under peace) due to heavy road transport reliance (41% of shipments) and elongated routes. Notably, conflict states prioritize regional imports, yet these transactions still emit 50% more CO\u2082 than peaceful counterparts (4.9M vs. 3.26M kg CO\u2082), exposing systemic inefficiencies.\\nScenario analysis demonstrates that resolving high-centrality conflicts (e.g., Russia\u2013Ukraine peace in S3) reduces global carbon emissions by 19.89%. Full peace (S6) yields threshold effects, reducing carbon emissions by 32.20% and eliminating compound logistical inefficiencies. However, partial resolutions risk trade-offs: S5 (USA\u2013Yemen peace) cuts emissions by 23.53% but reduces cereal flows by 14.86%, underscoring the tension between decarburization and food security. The BN framework uniquely quantifies causal pathways, showing that transport mode shifts\u2014not distance\u2014mediate emission spikes, with conflict-driven imports/exports exhibiting 3.3\u00d7 and 17\u00d7 higher carbon burdens, respectively.\\nOur Bayesian Network framework enables policymakers to test and optimize interventions\u2014such as specific mode usage, emission caps, or food security\u2014by simulating their impacts on trade efficiency.

This study develops a transportation network optimization model that reallocates cereal trade flows under assumed geopolitical stability. The study combines econometric assessment with algorithmic modeling to evaluate the effects of conflict resolution on cereal trade efficiency. Using country-level data, an algorithm was built to prioritize proximity and redistribute trade volumes to the nearest viable partners with sufficient surplus. The analysis uses averaged data from 2016\u20132021 and covers 206 exporting and 169 importing countries. The findings reveal that resolving conflicts and optimizing existing routes could reduce global transport costs by nearly $2 billion annually. While the Belt and Road Initiative offers strategic geopolitical advantages, results show underutilization of its infrastructure and substantial room for improvement in trade logistics. The study highlights the critical need for conflict resolution, better use of existing trade corridors, and targeted infrastructure investment to enhance cereal trade efficiency. The model identifies new trade corridors and indicates the need for infrastructure investments and diplomacy, especially in BRI and conflict-prone regions.\",\n        \"wehre I should submit this abstract find a good journal\",\n        \"find me jouanls where to publish the moderating effect of  services on labor productivity\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"cluster_id\": 3,\n      \"queries\": [\n        \"I have these variables\\n(labor productivity)\\n (urbanization of workers  )\\n(services value added)\\n(emission so2 )\\neducation(ppl abve graducate ) and health indiactor\\nfor north east of china , \\nwhat do u think is the best reserach can be perform\",\n        \"I have these variables (labor productivity) (urbanization of workers ) (services value added) (emission so2 ) education(ppl abve graducate ) and health indiactor for north east of china , \\nhow abouth the foloowing hwo does forign investment affect the labor produc tiyt trends\",\n        \"does foreing capital investment in north east of chaina affect urbanization or productivity\",\n        \"FDI is no longer benefical to the labour productivity of china\",\n        \"How does the foreign investment affect the labor productivity positively and negatively\",\n        \"what  is the moderating effect of  foreign investment on (the relationship between urbanization and labor productivity )\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"cluster_id\": 4,\n      \"queries\": [\n        \"is china  or its parts really ready for an econmic war\",\n        \"Why did GDP drop in Dalian or Northeastern", "user_id": "05b76536-b750-4db9-801a-0b48a4444914"}

Restorative justice, which focuses on repairing harm caused by criminal behavior through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders, offers a transformative approach to the traditional punitive justice system. Here\u2019s an analysis of the opportunities and challenges in the Moroccan context:\",\n        \"In Morocco, there are three classes of Child Detention Center: the National Juvenile Centers reserved for serious young offenders, the Centers for the Safeguarding of Childhood which handle those convicted of lesser offences and also houses a social services section which receives and protects children at risk, and the Centers for the Preparation of Reintegration which offer post-incarceration programs for social reintegration. Restorative justice could be introduced at any of these institutions with a view to facilitating indirect or direct dialogue between offenders and victims (or, as in the case of Sycamore Tree, with surrogate victims). Equally, restorative justice could be used to transform the response to resident\u2013resident, staff\u2013resident or staff\u2013staff conflicts in any of these institutions in much the same way that Search for Common Ground has used techniques of mediation in Moroccan prisons to these ends. Irrespective of which approach is taken, such a project would have the potential to benefit the employees and residents of any such institution, as well as their families, victims and Moroccan society as a whole.\",\n        \"In Morocco, it would be possible to build on and learn from the ways in which other Islamic and non-Islamic societies have used restorative justice with crime. It would also be pertinent to examine the Moroccan experience of ADR and the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. Moreover, it is important to recognize the significance of cultural differences in the way that justice is both perceived and done, but not to exaggerate such differences, instead placing emphasis on commonalities and utilizing flexible and responsive techniques, of which restorative justice is just one example. This way, all interested parties might come together to achieve the ultimate goals of respect for human rights, security and a decent standard of living for all Moroccans. This author believes restorative justice to be a particularly interesting and worthwhile area to examine because it transcends time and space; its values of mutual respect, dialogue and the communal ownership of conflicts and their resolution appears to be something that is shared by many nations, societies and cultures.\",\n        \"Rehabilitation and Reintegration of MOROCCAN JUVENILE Offenders:\",\n        \"By focusing on accountability and repairing harm, restorative justice can help offenders reintegrate into society more effectively, reducing recidivism rates.\",\n        \"Victim-Offender Mediation IN MORROCO\",\n        \"Current Policies and Practices OF JUVENILE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE\",\n        \"Current Policies and Practices OF RETORATIVE JUSTICE\",\n        \"Current Policies and Practices OF RETORATIVE JUVENILE JUSTICE\",\n        \"The policy framework for restorative justice has evolved significantly, with major international bodies providing key directives and guidelines.

Mars is now known to have hosted localized, short duration liquid water environments at its surface and shallow subsurface, with potentially extensive liquid water environments deep in its crust, however the duration, depths and geographic distribution of these environments are still poorly known, as are their potential habitability. Identifying locations where water and conditions that could potentially support life have occurred near the surface of Mars, or have persisted for significant periods of time, are of high importance: not just for their scientific significance in understanding the potential implications for biology, but also for identifying shallow subsurface water resources that could be accessed by crewed missions. Secondly, there is a diversity of satellite sensors gathering data across the electromagnetic spectrum, at differing spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. There is a compelling need to combine the data from different sensors to generate new products that have optimised spectral and spatial resolution and mitigate the limitations inherent to any one single sensor.", "Aims: The primary aim of the research project is to map the extent of the habitable regions of Mars throughout time using water/ice related impact morphologies, and identify regions where potential habitable environments may have persisted near to the surface, or for long periods of time. The secondary aim is to develop new algorithms and satellite data products using machine learning based multi-sensor fusion algorithms to combine the products from different sensors on different satellites thereby filling data acquisition gaps.", "Objectives: The objectives of this work are to quantify the extent of potentially habitable environments (PHEs) within the crust of Mars, where a habitable environment can be considered most broadly as one which supports: liquid water of varying plausible chemistries (brines), within a range of temperatures appropriate for terrestrial microorganisms. The existence of habitable conditions will be probed using a subset of impact craters that likely to have formed from the presence of water/ice in the subsurface. A range of satellite datasets will be used by the candidate to constrain the depth to, water concentration, salinity of, and age of the PHE, including: impact crater morphometry, mineralogy, rock and grain-sizes and their distribution. The remote sensing datasets used will include: high resolution camera imagery, elevation, thermal inertia, and multi-and hyperspectral data across the visible, shortwave infrared and thermal wavelengths from a range of sensors and satellites. The candidate will take existing machine learning image fusion algorithms, and further develop them to the unique application of infilling the particular temporal, spectral and spatial gaps of Mars satellite sensors to generate novel satellite data products at enhanced spectral and spatial resolutions than what is currently available. The output of the work will be maps of high priority PHE that occur near-surface, or zones where PHEs cluster and or conditions of habitability are likely to have persisted for a significant period of time.", "Significance: The outcomes of this work are significant for enhancing the knowledge capacity of past, present, current and future space-based datasets, through the development of innovative algorithmic tools specifically designed to address the wide gaps in satellite data coverage, thereby improving the potential knowledge and insights from future Australian\u2019s sensors and contributing key new knowledge for both the Australian and the global space sector.

Rather than relying solely on abstract theory, I integrate my personal journey as a first-time home buyer in Quebec to reflect on how digital innovation can reshape fragmented sectors. This experiential lens allowed me to assess technological disruption not just as an economic trend, but as a human-centered process of systemic change. Drawing on case studies, expert talks, and course insights from GTA6093, I examine how emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, and IoT are redefining industry operations and creating opportunities for transparency, co-creation, and long-term competitive advantage. Despite its economic significance, the real estate sector remains one of the least digitized industries, marked by fragmented processes, opaque pricing, long transaction cycles, and limited user empowerment. Buyers, especially first-time homeowners, often face information asymmetry, scattered documentation, and lack of real-time decision tools. These inefficiencies create friction not only for consumers but also for brokers, lenders, and public institutions\u2014highlighting an urgent need for integrated, transparent, and digitally-enabled solutions.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"cluster_id\": 2,\n      \"queries\": [\n        \"SolarWinds est une entreprise am\u00e9ricaine sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans les logiciels de gestion des infrastructures informatiques et des r\u00e9seaux.

These hacks highlight the need for zero-trust architecture, better vetting of third-party software, and a shift toward sovereign digital infrastructure to resist state-level espionage. The UN (including UNICEF) was compromised in a related timeframe, with attackers gaining access via Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities. These intrusions were suspected to involve state-linked actors \u2014 like SolarWinds \u2014 targeting humanitarian and diplomatic missions. It makes a powerful case for humanitarian organizations to treat cybersecurity as mission-critical, not just IT responsibility.\",\n        \"expand this paper, with good refrences Title suggestion: The United Nations Cyberattack (2019\u20132020): A Humanitarian Wake-Up Call in Light of the SolarWinds Supply Chain Breach This paper analyzes the 2019\u20132020 cyberattack targeting the United Nations, where threat actors exploited an unpatched Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to compromise servers in Geneva and Vienna. Among the affected systems was the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The attackers accessed critical infrastructure, moved laterally across the network, and deleted system logs\u2014making forensic investigation and incident response highly difficult. This event exposed serious technological risks such as weak patch management, lack of standardized data retention, insufficient segmentation, and low incident visibility. More critically, the UN chose not to publicly disclose the breach at the time, raising ethical questions about transparency, accountability, and the duty to protect sensitive humanitarian data. This analysis draws comparisons to the SolarWinds supply chain attack (2020), where malware inserted into Orion software updates compromised thousands of government and enterprise systems. While the UN attack did not involve a supply chain compromise, both incidents highlight systemic issues: overdependence on third-party technologies, failure to apply known security patches, fragmented coordination among internal units, and a lack of resilience in digital governance. Post-incident, the UN reportedly launched internal containment measures and rebuilt compromised systems, but little was shared externally, revealing both a technical and ethical blind spot. Unlike commercial entities bound by breach disclosure laws, international organizations like the UN operate in a legal gray zone, which demands new frameworks for cyber accountability in humanitarian contexts. This case emphasizes the importance of applying Zero Trust Architecture, establishing mandatory patch management protocols, enforcing standardized logging and data retention policies, and aligning with risk governance frameworks like NIST SP 800-161. Ethically, the case underlines the need for proactive disclosure policies and for embedding cybersecurity as part of humanitarian neutrality and protection. Key discussion questions include: Should humanitarian organizations be held to the same cybersecurity accountability standards as governments or private firms? How can neutrality be preserved without compromising digital security?\",\n        \"solarwind casestudy, please review all the academic refrencess\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"cluster_id\": 3,\n      \"queries\": [\n        \"Sujet privacy by design Exemple : Portail \u00ab Clic Sant\u00e9 \u00bb au Qu\u00e9bec Contexte : Le portail Clic Sant\u00e9 permet aux citoyens de prendre des rendez-vous pour des services m\u00e9dicaux (vaccination, d\u00e9pistage, etc.).

When shadows cover portions of a PV array, they create non-uniform irradiance conditions across the modules, resulting in \\\"the highest harm effect on the produced PV array power and its lifetime.\\\"\\n\\n(Yousri et al., 2020)\\n\\nThe impact of partial shading extends beyond simple power reduction, as it creates multiple peaks in the output characteristics, making it difficult for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms to locate the global maximum power point.\\n\\n(Zhu et al., 2020)\\n\\nThe fundamental challenge with partial shading arises from the series-parallel connections in conventional PV arrays. In series-connected modules, the module receiving the lowest irradiance limits the current of the entire string, causing significant power losses even when only a small portion of the array is shaded. This mismatch between modules leads to the formation of bypass diodes, which create multiple power peaks in the P-V characteristic curve and reduce the overall energy harvesting capability of the system. (Ameen et al., 2023)\\nTo mitigate these adverse effects, array reconfiguration has emerged as a promising solution. By dynamically adjusting the electrical connections between PV modules, reconfiguration techniques aim to distribute shadows more effectively across the array and minimize their impact on power production. (Yousri et al., 2020)\\n\\nThis approach is particularly effective because it directly addresses the fundamental issue of current mismatch in partially shaded arrays.\\nTraditional reconfiguration strategies have primarily focused on the principle of irradiance equalization, which aims to distribute modules with similar irradiance levels within the same rows to minimize current mismatch. While this approach works effectively in many shading scenarios, research has shown that it has limitations, particularly \\\"when the irradiance of individual modules differs greatly,\\\" where \\\"no matter how the PV modules are rearranged, a uniform row current cannot be obtained.\\\" \\n(Zhu et al., 2020)\\n\\nIn such cases, irradiance equalization strategies may not yield optimal results and could potentially decrease the maximum output power.\\nMore advanced approaches have been developed to overcome these limitations, including hierarchical-based switching block schemes that enable more flexible reconfiguration of PV arrays. These systems employ multiple levels of switching blocks to adapt effectively to complex shading patterns, offering \\\"a balance between low complexity, scalability, and superior energy harvesting efficiency.\\\"\\n\\n(Ameen et al., 2023)\\n\\nWhen compared to conventional configurations such as bridge-linked (BL), total-cross-tied (TCT), and series-parallel (SP), these dynamic reconfiguration techniques have demonstrated significant improvements in power generation\u2014up to 42.52% increase in some cases\u2014making them valuable solutions for practical PV applications operating under variable shading conditions.\\n\\n(Ameen et al., 2023)\",\n        \"Photovoltaic (PV) array reconfiguration techniques under partial shading conditions have witnessed significant advancements in recent years. The traditional restructuring approach primarily focused on the irradiance equalization principle, which aims to group PV modules with similar levels of radiation within the same rows or columns to reduce current mismatch. However, research has demonstrated limitations of this approach, particularly when irradiance varies widely among units. In such cases, no matter how the solar modules are rearranged, achieving a uniform current across a row is impossible (Chu et al., 2020).\\nUnder these circumstances, the irradiance equalization strategy may not only fail to optimize power output but can even reduce the maximum power generated by the reconfigured array.\\nTo address these limitations, researchers have proposed more advanced approaches that directly assess and maximize the power capacity generated by the solar array. Chu et al. (2020) formulated the reconfiguration problem as a 0-1 Multi-Knapsack Problem and developed a mathematical model that goes beyond simple current balancing to find genuinely optimal configurations. This method marks a significant step forward compared to previous techniques, as it simultaneously considers both current and voltage characteristics during optimization.\\nDynamic reconfiguration algorithms have also emerged as a promising trend. These algorithms modify the electrical connections of PV modules in real time in response to changing shading conditions. Vicenti et al. (2015) introduced a method for dynamic reshaping of arrays connected in a serial-branched form that preserves the physical dimensions of the matrix while reorganizing electrical connections to reduce shading impacts. Their approach relies on Rough Set Theory, enabling fast and efficient control system implementations capable of real-time optimal configuration determination (Vicenti et al., 2015).\\nSimilarly, Cherukuri et al. (2021) proposed a dynamic reconfiguration algorithm based solely on current measurements to estimate shadow dispersion rates and perform reconfiguration. This significantly reduces the number of sensors needed compared to existing PV matrix reconfiguration techniques (Cherukuri et al., 2021).\\nSwitch-based methods have gained growing attention due to their flexibility in implementing various reconfiguration strategies. Vadivel et al. (2021) described an optimization scheme for a 4\u00d74 sequential-branch connected matrix using a switching matrix to ensure equal current flow through each column. Their method divides the array into multiple sections and swaps connections to equalize column currents, producing a P-V curve with a single smooth peak. For situations where full current equalization is unattainable, they proposed supplementing reconfiguration with current injection\u2014injecting current into the column with the lowest current flow equal to the difference between the highest and lowest column currents (Vadivel et al., 2021).\\nMore recently, Fang et al. (2022) developed a dynamic reconfiguration method applicable to both Total-Cross-Tied (TCT) and Series-Parallel (SP) interconnected PV arrays of any size. Their approach uses a switching matrix to create flexible connections between PV strings and inverters, dynamically adjusting electrical connections based on mismatch conditions. Simulation results showed that this method outperforms fixed-topology schemes under various mismatch scenarios, achieving average maximum power point improvements of 8.56% for TCT arrays and 6.43% for SP arrays (Fang et al., 2022).\\nAdvanced architectural approaches have also been explored to enhance reconfiguration capabilities. Niazi et al. (2021) proposed a reconfiguration technique utilizing a switched-capacitor-based voltage equalizer with differential power processing for optimization at cell, subpanel, and panel levels. Their active charge redistribution architecture increases energy yield during mismatch conditions and provides voltage boosting when no mismatch exists by connecting PV cells or panels in series. The system monitors voltage and irradiance across each panel and performs reconfiguration accordingly, switching from series connections to differential power processing upon detecting mismatch (Niazi et al., 2021).\\nPerhaps the most promising recent advancement is the hierarchical-based switching block scheme introduced by Ameen et al. (2023). This design employs multiple levels of switching blocks to enable efficient and flexible PV array reconfiguration under complex shading patterns. The architecture strikes \\\"a balance between low complexity, scalability, and superior energy harvesting efficiency,\\\" making it suitable for practical applications.", "user_id": "095c4d1b-536a-5bd6-a1b5-d28011c46519"}

Among these methods, Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have emerged as particularly accessible and practical approaches for measuring brain function (Arif et al., 2024). EEG operates by directly measuring electrical signals through scalp electrodes, providing immediate feedback on neural activity (Arif et al., 2024) (Praveena et al., 2020). In contrast, fNIRS works by measuring changes in blood oxygen levels in the brain, specifically tracking variations in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations within the 650-1000 nm spectral range (Pollonini et al., 2016). A notable advantage of fNIRS is its practicality - it is non-harmful, portable, and relatively cost-effective compared to other brain imaging methods like fMRI (Pollonini et al., 2016) (Pinti et al., 2018). These characteristics make fNIRS particularly suitable for diverse research settings and participant populations, from newborns to elderly individuals, both within and outside laboratory environments (Pinti et al., 2018). Each technique offers distinct advantages in terms of resolution: EEG provides excellent temporal resolution but limited spatial precision, while fNIRS delivers better spatial resolution but slower temporal response due to the inherent delay in blood oxygen level changes (Arif et al., 2024). 15 \u062e\u0637 \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 \u0627\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0647 \u06a9\u0646"]}, {"cluster_id": 2, "queries": ["\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0631 \u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u0647 \u062a\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u06a9\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0632 eeg  \u0648 fnirs  \u06cc\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u06a9\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0633\u06cc \u06cc\u0627 \u06a9\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0646\u06cc"]}], "common_transition_types": ["request for summary/introduction to detailed explanation", "language switch (Persian to English)", "expansion (request for longer/more detailed text)", "topic shift (general overview to specific application/invention)"], "user_id": "0a155f75-1e54-530b-a851-a3b52f1a4237"}
