It has recently been proposed that a 10 M\u2295 object with an orbit of 700 AU semi major axis and 0.6 eccentricity can explain the observed distribution of Kuiper belt objects around Sedna. Here we use the INPOP planetary ephemerides model as a sensor for testing for an additional body in the solar system. We test the possibility of adding the proposed planet without increasing the residuals of the planetary ephemerides, fitted over the whole INPOP planetary data sample. We demonstrate that the presence of such an object is not compatible with the most sensitive data set, the Cassini radio ranging data, if its true anomaly is in the intervals [\u2212130\u00b0: \u2212100\u00b0 ] or [\u221265\u00b0:85\u00b0 ]. Moreover, we find that the addition of this object can reduce the Cassini residuals, with a most probable position given by a true anomaly v = 117.8\u00b0+11\u00b0-10\u00b0 .",

Very recently, this quest has reached a new level with the publication by Batygin & Brown (2016) of a proposal of a ninth planet to explain the clustering of the distant KBO in the vicinity of 2012 VP 113 . The gravitational interaction with this object (which we will call P9 from now on) should have scattered the bodies that are not confined in the vicinity of the central island of a pseudo resonance1 with P9. To be able to remove the bodies that were originally evenly distributed in a disk, P9 needs to be massive enough and not too far, with high eccentricity. Batygin & Brown (2016) propose a 10 M \u2295 planet with 0.6 eccentricity and a 700 AU semi major axis. In the present work, we examine the contraints given by the analysis of the dynamics of the solar system on the possibility of such a new planet.",

Manche, M. Gastineau\n## Abstract\nTo explain the unusual distribution of Kuiper belt objects, several authors have advocated the existence of a super-Earth planet in the outer solar system. It has recently been proposed that a 10 M\u2295 object with an orbit of 700 AU semi major axis and 0.6 eccentricity can explain the observed distribution of Kuiper belt objects around Sedna. Here we use the INPOP planetary ephemerides model as a sensor for testing for an additional body in the solar system. We test the possibility of adding the proposed planet without increasing the residuals of the planetary ephemerides, fitted over the whole INPOP planetary data sample. We demonstrate that the presence of such an object is not compatible with the most sensitive data set, the Cassini radio ranging data, if its true anomaly is in the intervals [\u2212130\u00b0: \u2212100\u00b0 ] or [\u221265\u00b0:85\u00b0 ]. Moreover, we find that the addition of this object can reduce the Cassini residuals, with a most probable position given by a true anomaly v = 117.8\u00b0+11\u00b0-10\u00b0 .\n## Introduction\nThe question of the existence of a massive object in the outer solar system thus becomes important for studying the present solar system's architecture and understanding its formation. Very recently, this quest has reached a new level with the publication by Batygin & Brown (2016) of a proposal of a ninth planet to explain the clustering of the distant KBO in the vicinity of 2012 VP 113 . The gravitational interaction with this object (which we will call P9 from now on) should have scattered the bodies that are not confined in the vicinity of the central island of a pseudo resonance1 with P9. To be able to remove the bodies that were originally evenly distributed in a disk, P9 needs to be massive enough and not too far, with high eccentricity. Batygin & Brown (2016) propose a 10 M \u2295 planet with 0.6 eccentricity and a 700 AU semi major axis. In the present work, we examine the contraints given by the analysis of the dynamics of the solar system on the possibility of such a new planet.",

Individual objects with orbits exterior to Neptune's-known as trans-Neptunian objects, or TNOs-are challenging to detect; owing to the steep, F\uf0a0\u221d\uf0a01/r 4 diminution of reflected flux, only the brightest such objects have been discovered.

Therefore, some recent studies suggest that Planet Nine could be a dark object, such as a primordial black hole. In this article, we show that the probability of capturing large trans-Neptunian objects by Planet Nine to form a satellite system in the scattered disk region (between the inner Oort Clouds and the Kuiper Belt) is large. By adopting a benchmark model of Planet Nine, we show that the tidal effect can heat up the satellites significantly, which can give sufficient thermal radio flux for observations, even if Planet Nine is a dark object.

                    "text": "Currently, there are 8 planets officially identified in our solar system. Most of the newly discovered large astronomical objects outside Neptune are dwarf planets or large asteroids called trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). In view of the TNOs, the new discovery of 2012 VP113 and some potential members of the inner Oort cloud has revealed a strange clustering in orbital elements (Trujilio & Sheppard 2014). The perihelion distance have arguments of perihelia \u03c9 clustered approximately round zero (Trujilio & Sheppard 2014;Batygin & Brown 2016a). Later analysis shows that the chance for this strange clustering due to random is just 0.0007% (Batygin & Brown 2016a). Therefore, a dynamical mechanism involving a new planet located at more than 100 AU has been suggested (Batygin et al. 2019). Many studies have constrained the mass and the orbital properties of the hypothesized planet 9 (P9) (Batygin & Brown 2016b;Sheppard & Trujillo 2016;Gomes, Deienno & Morbidelli 2016;Becker et al. 2018;Sheppard et al. 2019). Current benchmark models suggest that P9 has mass M 9 \u223c 5 \u2212 10M \u2295 , orbital semi-major axis a 9 \u223c 400 \u2212 800 AU and eccentricity e 9 \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.5 (Batygin et al. 2019). However, the in-situ formation of P9 is strongly disfavored so that P9 might be a captured planet from the free-floating objects nearby the solar system (Batygin et al. 2019;Kenyon & Bromley 2016). A more detailed assessment of the probability of capture can be found in Li & Adams (2016). \n\nCurrent benchmark models of P9 suggest that it has a temperature \u223c 40 K and a radius \u223c 3 \u2212 4R \u2295 (Batygin et al. 2019). The possible location of P9 in the celestial sphere is also constrained (Batygin et al. 2019;Fienga et al. 2016;Socas 2022).",

Chan\n## Abstract\nIn the past decade, numerical simulations started to reveal the possible existence of Planet Nine in our solar system. The Planet Nine scenario can provide an excellent explanation for the clustering in orbital elements for Kuiper Belt objects. However, no optical counterpart has been observed so far to verify the Planet Nine scenario. Therefore, some recent studies suggest that Planet Nine could be a dark object, such as a primordial black hole. In this article, we show that the probability of capturing large trans-Neptunian objects by Planet Nine to form a satellite system in the scattered disk region (between the inner Oort Clouds and the Kuiper Belt) is large. By adopting a benchmark model of Planet Nine, we show that the tidal effect can heat up the satellites significantly, which can give sufficient thermal radio flux for observations, even if Planet Nine is a dark object. This provides a new, indirect way for examining the Planet Nine hypothesis and revealing the basic properties of Planet Nine.\n## Introduction\nCurrently, there are 8 planets officially identified in our solar system. Most of the newly discovered large astronomical objects outside Neptune are dwarf planets or large asteroids called trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). In view of the TNOs, the new discovery of 2012 VP113 and some potential members of the inner Oort cloud has revealed a strange clustering in orbital elements (Trujilio & Sheppard 2014). The perihelion distance have arguments of perihelia \u03c9 clustered approximately round zero (Trujilio & Sheppard 2014;Batygin & Brown 2016a). Later analysis shows that the chance for this strange clustering due to random is just 0.0007% (Batygin & Brown 2016a). Therefore, a dynamical mechanism involving a new planet located at more than 100 AU has been suggested (Batygin et al. 2019). Many studies have constrained the mass and the orbital properties of the hypothesized planet 9 (P9) (Batygin & Brown 2016b;Sheppard & Trujillo 2016;Gomes, Deienno & Morbidelli 2016;Becker et al. 2018;Sheppard et al. 2019). Current benchmark models suggest that P9 has mass M 9 \u223c 5 \u2212 10M \u2295 , orbital semi-major axis a 9 \u223c 400 \u2212 800 AU and eccentricity e 9 \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.5 (Batygin et al. 2019). However, the in-situ formation of P9 is strongly disfavored so that P9 might be a captured planet from the free-floating objects nearby the solar system (Batygin et al. 2019;Kenyon & Bromley 2016). A more detailed assessment of the probability of capture can be found in Li & Adams (2016). \n\nCurrent benchmark models of P9 suggest that it has a temperature \u223c 40 K and a radius \u223c 3 \u2212 4R \u2295 (Batygin et al. 2019). The possible location of P9 in the celestial sphere is also constrained (Batygin et al. 2019;Fienga et al. 2016;Socas 2022).",

The  version of Planet Nine functions by explaining both the apsidal and ascending node alignment of a selection of objects in the Kuiper Belt. The objects under consideration in  were two overlapping sets of objects: first, those that have perihelion distance > q 30 au and semimajor axis > a 150 au, while being dynamically stable in the presence of Neptune; second, any objects that have > q 30 au and semimajor axis > a 250 au, all of which exhibit clustering in \u03d6 (when \u03d6 is defined as the longitude of perihelion, v w = + W). The orbit for Planet Nine presented in  was a rough estimate, with semimajor axis a = 700 au, eccentricity e = 0.6, inclination i = 30\u00b0, longitude of ascending node \u03a9 = 113\u00b0, and argument of perihelion w = 150\u00b0. The authors estimated the planet to have a mass of roughly 10 Earth masses, but all of these orbit predictions were noted as approximate. This mass estimate was supported in a follow-up effort by the predicting authors , which placed constraints on the orbital elements of the potential Planet Nine by using N-body simulations to determine which Planet Nine realizations lead to clustered TNOs in simulations. In this work, the authors determined that a 10-Earth-mass Planet Nine was more likely to recreate the observed clustering than a 20-Earth-mass Planet Nine.\n\nThe possibility of a new planet has led to a great deal of recent work, for example, to evaluate the likelihood of Planet Nine's existence given the known properties of the solar system. For example, Fienga et al. (2016) and Holman & Payne (2016) examined the measured Earth-Saturn distance and determined that Planet Nine is likely to have a true anomaly near 117\u00b0(based on the upper limit to the amplitude of the residuals for that distance measurement).

Adams, T. Khain, S. Hamilton, D. Gerdes\n## Abstract\nWe evaluate the dynamical stability of a selection of outer solar system objects in the presence of the proposed new solar system member Planet Nine. We use a Monte Carlo suite of numerical N-body integrations to construct a variety of orbital elements of the new planet and evaluate the dynamical stability of eight trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in the presence of Planet Nine. These simulations show that some combinations of orbital elements ( ) result in Planet Nine acting as a stabilizing influence on the TNOs, which can otherwise be destabilized by interactions with Neptune. These simulations also suggest that some TNOs transition between several different mean-motion resonances during their lifetimes while still retaining approximate apsidal antialignment with Planet Nine. This behavior suggests that remaining in one particular orbit is not a requirement for orbital stability. As one product of our simulations, we present an a posteriori probability distribution for the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the proposed Planet Nine based on TNO stability. This result thus provides additional evidence that supports the existence of this proposed planet. We also predict that TNOs can be grouped into multiple populations of objects that interact with Planet Nine in different ways: one population may contain objects like Sedna and 2012 VP113, which do not migrate significantly in semimajor axis in the presence of Planet Nine and tend to stay in the same resonance; another population may contain objects like 2007 TG422 and 2013 RF98, which may both migrate and transition between different resonances.\n## Introduction\nperiod TNOs could force the TNOs to keep their \u03c9 confined to be near either 0\u00b0or 180\u00b0(for example, this could occur via the Kozai mechanism).  also suggested the existence of an additional planet (Planet Nine), which is differentiated from the potential planet discussed in Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) in the way it interacts with the TNOs. The  version of Planet Nine functions by explaining both the apsidal and ascending node alignment of a selection of objects in the Kuiper Belt. The objects under consideration in  were two overlapping sets of objects: first, those that have perihelion distance > q 30 au and semimajor axis > a 150 au, while being dynamically stable in the presence of Neptune; second, any objects that have > q 30 au and semimajor axis > a 250 au, all of which exhibit clustering in \u03d6 (when \u03d6 is defined as the longitude of perihelion, v w = + W). The orbit for Planet Nine presented in  was a rough estimate, with semimajor axis a = 700 au, eccentricity e = 0.6, inclination i = 30\u00b0, longitude of ascending node \u03a9 = 113\u00b0, and argument of perihelion w = 150\u00b0. The authors estimated the planet to have a mass of roughly 10 Earth masses, but all of these orbit predictions were noted as approximate. This mass estimate was supported in a follow-up effort by the predicting authors , which placed constraints on the orbital elements of the potential Planet Nine by using N-body simulations to determine which Planet Nine realizations lead to clustered TNOs in simulations. In this work, the authors determined that a 10-Earth-mass Planet Nine was more likely to recreate the observed clustering than a 20-Earth-mass Planet Nine.\n\nThe possibility of a new planet has led to a great deal of recent work, for example, to evaluate the likelihood of Planet Nine's existence given the known properties of the solar system. For example, Fienga et al. (2016) and Holman & Payne (2016) examined the measured Earth-Saturn distance and determined that Planet Nine is likely to have a true anomaly near 117\u00b0(based on the upper limit to the amplitude of the residuals for that distance measurement). In complementary work, Malhot\n...\nFienga et al. (2016) and Holman & Payne (2016) examined the measured Earth-Saturn distance and determined that Planet Nine is likely to have a true anomaly near 117\u00b0(based on the upper limit to the amplitude of the residuals for that distance measurement). In complementary work, Malhotra et al. (2016) evaluated the potential resonant behavior that Planet Nine could invoke in the population of long-period TNOs, and they predicted that Planet Nine should have a semimajor axis of a = 665 au in order to support stability-boosting resonances. Other authors (de la Fuente Marcos et al. 2016;Lawler et al. 2016) have examined the dynamical effects that Planet Nine would have on the populations of objects that exist in the solar system. Finally, additional work was carried out to explain how Planet Nine would fit into our existing picture of the solar system. For example, multiple groups found that the existence of such a ninth planet can be invoked to explain the six-degree obliquity of the Sun (Bailey et al. 2016;Lai 2016;Gomes et al. 2017).

This work aims to find Planet Nine candidates by taking advantage of two far-infrared all-sky surveys, which are IRAS and AKARI. The epochs of these two surveys were separated by 23 years, which is large enough to detect Planet Nine\u2019s \u223c 3\u2032/year orbital motion. We use a dedicated AKARI Far-Infrared point source list for the purpose of our Planet Nine search \u2014 AKARI-FIS Monthly Unconfirmed Source List (AKARI-MUSL), which includes sources detected repeatedly only in hours timescale, but not after months. AKARI-MUSL is more advantageous than the AKARI Bright Source Catalogue (AKARI-BSC) for detecting moving and faint objects like Planet Nine with a twice-deeper flux detection limit. We search for objects that moved slowly between IRAS and AKARI detections given in the catalogues. First, we estimated the expected flux and orbital motion of Planet Nine by assuming its mass, distance, and effective temperature to ensure it can be detected by IRAS and AKARI, then applied the positional and flux selection criteria to narrow down the number of sources from the catalogues. Next, we produced all possible candidate pairs including one IRAS source and one AKARI source whose angular separations were limited between 42\u2032 and 69.6\u2032, corresponding to the heliocentric distance range of 500 \u2013 700 AU and the mass range of 7 \u2013 17M\u2295. There are 13 candidate pairs obtained after the selection criteria. After image inspection, we found one good candidate, of which the IRAS source is absent from the same coordinate in the AKARI image after 23 years and vice versa. However, AKARI and IRAS detections are not enough to determine the full orbit of this candidate. This issue leads to the need for follow-up observations, which will determine the Keplerian motion of our Planet Nine candidate.",

Next, we produced all possible candidate pairs including one IRAS source and one AKARI source whose angular separations were limited between 42\u2032 and 69.6\u2032, corresponding to the heliocentric distance range of 500 \u2013 700 AU and the mass range of 7 \u2013 17M\u2295. There are 13 candidate pairs obtained after the selection criteria. After image inspection, we found one good candidate, of which the IRAS source is absent from the same coordinate in the AKARI image after 23 years and vice versa. However, AKARI and IRAS detections are not enough to determine the full orbit of this candidate. This issue leads to the need for follow-up observations, which will determine the Keplerian motion of our Planet Nine candidate.\n## Discussions\nIt is essential to figure out solutions for these issues. The follow-up observation using Dark Energy Camera (DECam) Imager mounted on the Blanco telescope with 3 deg 2 field of view k can offer a promising opportunity to examine the Keplerian motion of our good candidate pair. Figure 9 in Brown and Batygin (2021) indicates that the predicted r-band magnitude of Planet Nine is less than 26. Such an upper limit of 26 AB mag only needs roughly one hour to reach a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 using the r-band filter of DECam l . Brown, Holman, and Batygin (2024) pointed out that 9 detections are required to evaluate a linked Keplerian orbit with improved processing speed and reduce the number of false positives. The method of the follow-up analysis should be similar to this study. We can start to estimate the expected orbital motion over 18 years (from 2006 to 2024), which varies between 33 \u2032 and 54.7 \u2032 , corresponding to the heliocentric distance range of 500 -700 AU. If the existence of Planet Nine can be confirmed by observations in the near future, it will improve our understanding of the history and structure of the entire solar system in early stages.",

Schlegel, S. Kenyon, E. Schlafly, K. Dawson\n## Abstract\nA distant, as yet unseen ninth planet has been invoked to explain various observations of the outer solar system. While such a \u201cPlanet Nine,\u201d if it exists, is most likely to be discovered via reflected light in the optical, it may emit much more strongly at 3\u22125 \u03bcm than simple blackbody predictions would suggest, depending on its atmospheric properties. As a result, Planet Nine may be detectable at 3.4 \u03bcm with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, but single exposures are too shallow except at relatively small distances ( au). We develop a method to search for Planet Nine far beyond the W1 single-exposure sensitivity, to distances as large as 800 au, using inertial coadds of W1 exposures binned into \u223c1 day intervals. We apply our methodology to a \u223c2000 square degree testbed sky region which overlaps a southern segment of Planet Nine\u2019s anticipated orbital path. We do not detect a plausible Planet Nine candidate, but are able to derive a detailed completeness curve, ruling out its presence within the parameter space searched at W1 < 16.66 (90% completeness). Our method uses all publicly available W1 imaging, spanning 2010 January to 2015 December, and will become more sensitive with future NEOWISE-Reactivation releases of additional W1 exposures. We anticipate that our method will be applicable to the entire high Galactic latitude sky, and we will extend our search to that full footprint in the near future.\n",

            "abstract": "Uranus\u2019s startlingly large obliquity of 98\u00b0 has yet to admit a satisfactory explanation. The most widely accepted hypothesis involving a giant impactor that tipped Uranus onto its side encounters several difficulties with regard to Uranus\u2019s spin rate and prograde satellite system. An obliquity increase that was driven by capture of Uranus into a secular spin\u2013orbit resonance remains a possible alternative hypothesis that avoids many of the issues associated with a giant impact. We propose that secular spin\u2013orbit resonance could have excited Uranus\u2019s obliquity to its present-day value if it was driven by the outward migration of an as-yet-undetected outer solar system body commonly known as Planet Nine. We draw support for our hypothesis from an analysis of 123 N-body simulations with varying parameters for Planet Nine and its migration. We find that in multiple instances, a simulated Planet Nine drives Uranus\u2019s obliquity past 98\u00b0, with a significant number falling within 10% of this value. We note a significant caveat to our results in that a much faster than present-day spin axis precession rate for Uranus is required in all cases for it to reach high obliquities. We conclude that while it was, in principle, possible for Planet Nine (if it exists) to have been responsible for Uranus\u2019s obliquity, the feasibility of such a result hinges on Uranus\u2019s primordial precession rate.",

                    "text": "We now examine simulations of a Solar System dynamical model that includes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Planet Nine. To save computation time the terrestrial planets were not included, as their effects are negligible. For each simulation, we initialize Planet Nine at 40 AU. The \u03c4 a parameter, as seen in Kostov et al. (2016), parameterizes the rate of change in the system. The evolution of Planet Nine's semi-major axis is given by a = a 0 e t/\u03c4a , ( \n\nIn practice, perturbative influences from the other planets lead to slightly more complex realized semi-major axis evolution and hence a non-deterministic final a. We set \u03c4 a = 4 \u00d7 10 7 years for each of our simulations -for this value, the semi-major axis progresses through 2.5 e-folding timescales. We emphasize that our choice of initial a and \u03c4 a do not reflect Planet Nine's true initial position or migratory trajectory -recall that Planet Nine is believed to have originated with the giant planets. Rather, the value of 40 AU is picked to encapsulate as much of the evolutionary trajectory as possible, without sacrificing the stability of the simulation. As the effect of Planet Nine on the Uranian \u2126 only increases for smaller semi-major axis (per secular theory), bringing Planet Nine's initial position closer in would serve to bring the ratio \u03b1/g down, which favors resonant capture. Therefore, in principle any smaller initial a 9 and any \u03c4 a satisfying the adiabatic criterion should yield similar or larger obliquities than our simulations. We also emphasize that the given migration scheme does not represent the most accurate physical evolutionary pathway of Planet 9's semimajor axis. In reality, Planet 9's outward migration was likely not smooth and its expansion rate likely decreased with time. We will discuss a more realistic migration scheme in Section 5.4 -for now, the simple exponential model of semimajor axis growth is selected for ease of use and is sufficient to draw firstorder conclusions, given that as long as the evolution remains within the adiabatic limit the precise evolution of the semimajor axis should not significantly impact the dynamics.",

                    "text": "Short of full numerical simulations that track the Uranian node, significant physical intuition can be gained from the linear approximation provided by Laplace-Lagrange secular theory. Secular theory describes the orbital motion of planetary orbits as an averaged approximation of their long term motions. Terms in the gravitational disturbing function that include the mean longitude are ignored in this approximation, as they vary relatively rapidly and in the long term average to zero. In the late 1700s, it was determined that to lowest order, the time dependence of the eccentricities e (Laplace 1775) and the inclinations I (Lagrange 1778) of a planetary system with k bodies are described by a system of first-order linear differential equations \n\nWhich was applied to the motion of the solar system planets by Laplace (1784) (for an in-depth review of the development of Laplace-Lagrange secular theory, see (Laskar 2013)). Here z \u2261 e exp \u221a \u22121 and \n\nwhere the quantities \u03b4 j , \u03b1 ij , \u03b3 j , \u03b2 ij are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the A k and B k matrices, respectively. The i and j indices range from 1 to k and represent each planet in the system. Of particular interest to our analysis is the quantity \u03b4 j , which determines the \"forcing frequency\" at which the jth body perturbs \u2126. \n\nA slightly modified version of the foregoing theory that is specific to the Solar System (and which partially accounts for additional Jupiter-Saturn interactions) was developed by Brouwer & van Woerkom (1950), and was notably reprinted in (Murray & Dermott 2000). \n\nGiven the time evolution of z i and \u03b6 i , the orbital elements (see Equation 11) including \u2126 can be recovered. Figure 5 shows the inclination evolution of the four outer planets implied by secular theory, as well as the evolution of the Uranian g. Planet Nine is a hypothesized body in the outer Solar System whose existence has been inferred from the apparent apsidal confinement of long-period trans-Neptunian objects (Batygin & Brown 2016).

We incorporated orbit-averaged physical forces to simulate the outward migration of Planet Nine using the modify orbits forces implementation (Kostov et al. 2016) in the REBOUNDx package (Tamayo et al. 2019). \n\nAn overview of our modeling procedure is as follows. A REBOUND simulation is initialized with the Sun and the four outer planets in their present-day configuration, with orbital element values from the NASA HORIZONS database. Planet Nine is then initialized in its starting position. Free parameters associated with Planet Nine include its mass, its eccentricity, and its inclination. We set the initial semi-major axis and \u03c4 a (which parameterizes the migration rate as seen in Kostov et al. (2016)) constant. The system as thus specified is in the frame of the ecliptic. We then determine the invariant plane of the Solar System with Planet Nine accounted for, via the method outlined by Souami & Souchay (2012). The normal vector to the invariant plane is \n\nwhere m j , r j , v j are the mass, barycentric position, and barycentric velocity of the jth body, respectively. We recalculate the inclination of each planet in the invariant frame by taking the angle between Ltot and the planet's own orbital angular momentum vector.

The results of the REBOUND simulation (namely, values for the Uranian inclination, eccentricity, \u2126, and ) are used to construct time evolutions of the orbital elements e(t), p(t), q(t).

Laughlin\n## Abstract\nUranus\u2019s startlingly large obliquity of 98\u00b0 has yet to admit a satisfactory explanation. The most widely accepted hypothesis involving a giant impactor that tipped Uranus onto its side encounters several difficulties with regard to Uranus\u2019s spin rate and prograde satellite system. An obliquity increase that was driven by capture of Uranus into a secular spin\u2013orbit resonance remains a possible alternative hypothesis that avoids many of the issues associated with a giant impact. We propose that secular spin\u2013orbit resonance could have excited Uranus\u2019s obliquity to its present-day value if it was driven by the outward migration of an as-yet-undetected outer solar system body commonly known as Planet Nine. We draw support for our hypothesis from an analysis of 123 N-body simulations with varying parameters for Planet Nine and its migration. We find that in multiple instances, a simulated Planet Nine drives Uranus\u2019s obliquity past 98\u00b0, with a significant number falling within 10% of this value. We note a significant caveat to our results in that a much faster than present-day spin axis precession rate for Uranus is required in all cases for it to reach high obliquities. We conclude that while it was, in principle, possible for Planet Nine (if it exists) to have been responsible for Uranus\u2019s obliquity, the feasibility of such a result hinges on Uranus\u2019s primordial precession rate.\n## Laplace-Lagrange Secular Theory\nShort of full numerical simulations that track the Uranian node, significant physical intuition can be gained from the linear approximation provided by Laplace-Lagrange secular theory. Secular theory describes the orbital motion of planetary orbits as an averaged approximation of their long term motions. Terms in the gravitational disturbing function that include the mean longitude are ignored in this approximation, as they vary relatively rapidly and in the long term average to zero. In the late 1700s, it was determined that to lowest order, the time dependence of the eccentricities e (Laplace 1775) and the inclinations I (Lagrange 1778) of a planetary system with k bodies are described by a system of first-order linear differential equations \n\nWhich was applied to the motion of the solar system planets by Laplace (1784) (for an in-depth review of the development of Laplace-Lagrange secular theory, see (Laskar 2013)). Here z \u2261 e exp \u221a \u22121 and \n\nwhere the quantities \u03b4 j , \u03b1 ij , \u03b3 j , \u03b2 ij are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the A k and B k matrices, respectively. The i and j indices range from 1 to k and represent each planet in the system. Of particular interest to our analysis is the quantity \u03b4 j , which determines the \"forcing frequency\" at which the jth body perturbs \u2126. \n\nA slightly modified version of the foregoing theory that is specific to the Solar System (and which partially accounts for additional Jupiter-Saturn interactions) was developed by Brouwer & van Woerkom (1950), and was notably reprinted in (Murray & Dermott 2000). \n\nGiven the time evolution of z i and \u03b6 i , the orbital elements (see Equation 11) including \u2126 can be recovered. Figure 5 shows the inclination evolution of the four outer planets implied by secular theory, as well as the evolution of the Uranian g. Planet Nine is a hypothesized body in the outer Solar System whose existence has been inferred from the apparent apsidal confinement of long-period trans-Neptunian objects (Batygin & Brown 2016). For a more detailed review of the evidence for Planet Nine, see (Batygin et al. 2019).\n\n## Numerical Simulations\nThe Laplace-Lagrange theory assumes constant semimajor axes for all planets, and additionally fails in the limit of significant short-period terms (Camargo et al. 2018), so a migrating Planet Nine cannot be modelled in this framework. We instead turn to full N-body integrations that employ the REBOUND package with the adaptive high-order IAS15 integrator (Rein & Spiegel 2015). We incorporated orbit-averaged physical forces to simulate the outward migration of Planet Nine using the modify orbits forces implementation (Kostov et al. 2016) in the REBOUNDx package (Tamayo et al. 2019). \n\nAn overview of our modeling procedure is as follows. A REBOUND simulation is initialized with the Sun and the four outer planets in their present-day configuration, with orbital element values from the NASA HORIZONS database. Planet Nine is then initialized in its starting position. Free parameters associated with Planet Nine include its mass, its eccentricity, and its inclination. We set the initial semi-major axis and \u03c4 a (which parameterizes the migration rate as seen in Kostov et al. (2016)) constant. The system as thus specified is in the frame of the ecliptic. We then determine the invariant plane of the Solar System with Planet Nine accounted for, via the method outlined by Souami & Souchay (2012). The normal vector to the invariant plane is \n\nwhere m j , r j , v j are the mass, barycentric position, and barycentric velocity of the jth body, respectively. We recalculate the inclination of each planet in the invariant frame by taking the angle between Ltot and the planet's own orbital angular momentum vector. Each simulation is then integrated forward for 10 8 years. The results of the REBOUND simulation (namely, values for the Uranian inclination, eccentricity, \u2126, and ) are used to construct time evolutions of the orbital elements e(t), p(t), q(t). The orbital elements at each timestep are then passed into the spin axis equation of motion (eq. 10) to track the motion of the spin axis.\n\n## Solar System Model\nWe now examine simulations of a Solar System dynamical model that includes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Planet Nine. To save computation time the terrestrial planets were not included, as their effects are negligible. For each simulation, we initialize Planet Nine at 40 AU. The \u03c4 a parameter, as seen in Kostov et al. (2016), parameterizes the rate of change in the system. The evolution of Planet Nine's semi-major axis is given by a = a 0 e t/\u03c4a , ( \n\nIn practice, perturbative influences from the other planets lead to slightly more complex realized semi-major axis evolution and hence a non-deterministic final a. We set \u03c4 a = 4 \u00d7 10 7 years for each of our simulations -for this value, the semi-major axis progresses through 2.5 e-folding timescales. We emphasize that our choice of initial a and \u03c4 a do not reflect Planet Nine's true initial position or migratory trajectory -recall that Planet Nine is believed to have originated with the giant planets. Rather, the value of 40 AU is picked to encapsulate as much of the evolutionary trajectory as possible, without sacrificing the stability of the simulation. As the effect of Planet Nine on the Uranian \u2126 only increases for smaller semi-major axis (per secular theory), bringing Planet Nine's initial position closer in would serve to bring the ratio \u03b1/g down, which favors resonant capture. Therefore, in principle any smaller initial a 9 and any \u03c4 a satisfying the adiabatic criterion should yield similar or larger obliquities than our simulations. We also emphasize that the given migration scheme does not represent the most accurate physical evolutionary pathway of Planet 9's semimajor axis. In reality, Planet 9's outward migration was likely not smooth and its expansion rate likely decreased with time. We will discuss a more realistic migration scheme in Section 5.4 -for now, the simple exponential model of semimajor axis growth is selected for ease of use and is sufficient to draw firstorder conclusions, given that as long as the evolution remains within the adiabatic limit the precise evolution of the semimajor axis should not significantly impact the dynamics.",

The disk we consider represents the early debris disk a remnant from the Sun's formation era. For a short time interaction of a planet and a ring of debris around it, see Lee & Chiang (2016). We show that Planet Nine, due to its large sma, dominates the evolution of the outer disk between 1000 \u2212 5000AU. This results in a spheroidal structure at 1100AU aTAUS 1500AU where TAUS stands for \"Thousand AU Sphere\", surrounded by an inclined disk aligned to Planet Nine orbital plane and a warped disk towards the ecliptic plane. This structure serves as a new source of Sun grazing comets, penetrating the inner solar system by long term secular evolution and dynamical interaction with Planet Nine. \n\nOur paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the numerical simulation. In section 3 we describe the results of the numerical runs in comparison to the standard Hills cloud formation mechanism, i.e. a fly-by event in the early stages of the solar system. In section 4 we present the implications of TAUS to the morphology of the outer solar system as well as the rate and orientation of comets originating from this region. Finally, we summarize the results and their implications in section 5.",

Additionally, Li & Adams (2016) calculated the survival rates and the interaction cross section of the proposed planet, and Lawler et al. ( 2016) investigated the impact of Planet Nine of the Kuiper belt objects. Perets & Kouwenhoven (2012) described a mechanism of a planet captured from a different star system or a rouge planet, and predicted a wide, eccentric and inclined orbit of the captured planet. \n\nIn this work we explore the interaction of a captured Planet Nine with an initially flat ecliptic disk around the Sun. The disk we consider represents the early debris disk a remnant from the Sun's formation era. For a short time interaction of a planet and a ring of debris around it, see Lee & Chiang (2016). We show that Planet Nine, due to its large sma, dominates the evolution of the outer disk between 1000 \u2212 5000AU. This results in a spheroidal structure at 1100AU aTAUS 1500AU where TAUS stands for \"Thousand AU Sphere\", surrounded by an inclined disk aligned to Planet Nine orbital plane and a warped disk towards the ecliptic plane. This structure serves as a new source of Sun grazing comets, penetrating the inner solar system by long term secular evolution and dynamical interaction with Planet Nine. \n\nOur paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the numerical simulation. In section 3 we describe the results of the numerical runs in comparison to the standard Hills cloud formation mechanism, i.e. a fly-by event in the early stages of the solar system. In section 4 we present the implications of TAUS to the morphology of the outer solar system as well as the rate and orientation of comets originating from this region. Finally, we summarize the results and their implications in section 5.",

In this work, we characterize the dynamical processes at play from semi-analytic grounds. We begin by considering a purely secular model of orbital evolution induced by Planet Nine and show that it is at odds with the ensuing stability of distant objects. Instead, the long-term survival of the clustered population of long-period Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) is enabled by a web of mean-motion resonances driven by Planet Nine. Then, by taking a compact-form approach to perturbation theory, we show that it is the secular dynamics embedded within these resonances that regulate the orbital confinement and perihelion detachment of distant KBOs. Finally, we demonstrate that the onset of large-amplitude oscillations of the orbital inclinations is accomplished through the capture of low-inclination objects into a high-order secular resonance, and we identify the specific harmonic that drives the evolution. In light of the developed qualitative understanding of the governing dynamics, we offer an updated interpretation of the current observational data set within the broader theoretical framework of the Planet Nine hypothesis.",

Brown\n## Abstract\nThe six-degree obliquity of the Sun suggests that either an asymmetry was present in the solar system\u2019s formation environment, or an external torque has misaligned the angular momentum vectors of the Sun and the planets. However, the exact origin of this obliquity remains an open question. Batygin & Brown have recently shown that the physical alignment of distant Kuiper Belt orbits can be explained by a planet on a distant, eccentric, and inclined orbit, with an approximate perihelion distance of \u223c250 au. Using an analytic model for secular interactions between Planet Nine and the remaining giant planets, here, we show that a planet with similar parameters can naturally generate the observed obliquity as well as the specific pole position of the Sun\u2019s spin axis, from a nearly aligned initial state. Thus, Planet Nine offers a testable explanation for the otherwise mysterious spin\u2013orbit misalignment of the solar system.\n## INTRODUCTION\nTo this end, ALMA observations of misaligned disks in stellar binaries (Jensen & Akeson 2014;Williams et al. 2014) have provided evidence for the feasibility of this effect. Although individually sensible, a general qualitative drawback of all of the above mechanisms is that they are only testable when applied to the extrasolar population of planets, and it is difficult to discern which (if any) of the aforementioned processes operated in our solar system. \n\nRecently, Batygin & Brown (2016) determined that the spatial clustering of the orbits of Kuiper Belt objects with semi-major axis a 250 AU can be understood if the solar system hosts an additional m 9 = 5 \u2212 20 m \u2295 planet on a distant, eccentric orbit. Here, we refer to this object as Planet Nine. The orbital parameters of this planet reside somewhere along a swath of parameter space spanning hundreds of AU in semi-major axis, significant eccentricity, and tens of degrees of inclination, with a perihelion distance of roughly q 9 \u223c 250 AU\n\n## DISCUSSION\nApplying the well-established analytic methods of secular theory, we have demonstrated that a solar obliquity of order several degrees is an expected observable effect of Planet Nine. Moreover, for a range of masses and orbits of Planet Nine that are broadly consistent with those predicted by Batygin & Brown (2016); Brown & Batygin (2016), Planet Nine is capable of reproducing the observed solar obliquity of 6 degrees, from a nearly coplanar configuration. The existence of Planet Nine therefore provides a tangible explanation for the spinorbit misalignment of the solar system. \n\nWithin the context of the Planet Nine hypothesis, a strictly null tilt of the solar spin-axis is disallowed. However, as already mentioned above, in addition to the longterm gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine, numerous other physical processes are thought to generate stellar obliquities (see e.g. Crida & Batygin 2014 and the references therein). A related question then, concerns the role of Planet Nine with respect to every other plausible misalignment mechanism. Within the context of our model, this question is informed by the present-day offset between the longitudes of ascending node of Planet Nine and the Sun, \u2206 \u2126.

Particularly interesting objects are the newly discovered retrograde ETNOs with relatively small  and large , which have been shown to belong to the same dynamical class as the already known prograde ETNOs and Centaurs. These objects are dynamically unconnected when Newtonian dynamics is used. MOND produces the clustering of orbital planes as well as the apsidal confinement, but these features are not particularly strong in this model. On the other hand, the observations are still inconclusive. More new objects are clearly needed to enrich the sample and confirm or rule out the anomalous features of ETNOs.",

The probable parameters of its orbit are: the semimajor axis a = 400 \u2212 1000 au, the eccentricity e = 0.2 \u2212 0.5 and the inclination 30 \u2212 60 \u2022 . A planet with similar orbital parameters could also be captured in the solar system [10,15]. In the work [16], the hypothesis was proposed that the 9th planet is a captured primordial black hole (PBH). \n\nIn the above works, the capture into an already formed planetary system was considered. In this paper, we point out the existence of another (additional) capture mechanism at the stage before the formation of a planetary system and even before the formation of a star. We are considering the capture of free-floating planets in a contracting protostellar cloud. When a planet passes by a static gravitating object, the planet first gains kinetic energy, and then loses exactly the same kinetic energy. If a planet flies into a contracting protostellar cloud, then when moving to the center of the cloud, a smaller force of attraction acts on the planet than when moving further away from the center, because the density of the cloud increases over time, and the force of gravity at a fixed radial distance from the center increases with time. As a result, a planet floating into the cloud at the stage of approaching the center of the cloud acquires less kinetic energy than it loses at a subsequent fly out from the center. With a sufficiently large difference between the lost and acquired energies, the planet may end up in a finite elliptical orbit. \n\nIn this paper, we performed statistical modelling and found the probability of capturing planets in a contracting cloud. With certain plausible assumptions about the structure of the cloud and the structure of the surrounding region of star formation, it turns out that the probability of capture into the cloud is comparable to the probability of capture into an already formed planetary system. Due to this, the overall probability of capturing the planets increases by about 70%.",

Eroshenko\n## Abstract\nNone\n## INTRODUCTION\nIn the works [13,14], indications were obtained that * e-mail: eroshenko@inr.ac.ru the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects are correlated in a certain way, which may point to the presence of 9th planet with a mass 5 \u2212 10M \u2295 on the periphery of the solar system. The probable parameters of its orbit are: the semimajor axis a = 400 \u2212 1000 au, the eccentricity e = 0.2 \u2212 0.5 and the inclination 30 \u2212 60 \u2022 . A planet with similar orbital parameters could also be captured in the solar system [10,15]. In the work [16], the hypothesis was proposed that the 9th planet is a captured primordial black hole (PBH). \n\nIn the above works, the capture into an already formed planetary system was considered. In this paper, we point out the existence of another (additional) capture mechanism at the stage before the formation of a planetary system and even before the formation of a star. We are considering the capture of free-floating planets in a contracting protostellar cloud. When a planet passes by a static gravitating object, the planet first gains kinetic energy, and then loses exactly the same kinetic energy. If a planet flies into a contracting protostellar cloud, then when moving to the center of the cloud, a smaller force of attraction acts on the planet than when moving further away from the center, because the density of the cloud increases over time, and the force of gravity at a fixed radial distance from the center increases with time. As a result, a planet floating into the cloud at the stage of approaching the center of the cloud acquires less kinetic energy than it loses at a subsequent fly out from the center. With a sufficiently large difference between the lost and acquired energies, the planet may end up in a finite elliptical orbit. \n\nIn this paper, we performed statistical modelling and found the probability of capturing planets in a contracting cloud. With certain plausible assumptions about the structure of the cloud and the structure of the surrounding region of star formation, it turns out that the probability of capture into the cloud is comparable to the probability of capture into an already formed planetary system. Due to this, the overall probability of capturing the planets increases by about 70%.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nThe presence of exoplanets with wide orbits, the possible existence of 9th planets in our solar system [13,14] and the discovery of a population of free-floating planets [1] led to the hypothesis of the capture of free-floating planets in planetary systems due to the variable gravitational field of a star and a giant planet [7,8,11,15]. In the case of the solar system, it is the Sun and Jupiter. In [9], detailed calculations of the capture cross-section were performed. \n\nIn this paper, we have shown that capture into an already formed planetary system is not the only capture option, but there is also the possibility of capture into a collapsing protostellar cloud at the stage before the formation of a star. Despite the fact that the compression of the cloud in the free fall mode lasts for a short time, during this period there is a strong change in the gravitational potential. In addition, the size of the collapsing cloud is much larger than the size of Jupiter's orbit. Both of these factors lead to the fact that the probability of capture in a collapsing cloud is comparable to the probability of capture in an already formed planetary system. \n\nThe capture of free-floating planets is most likely in a protostellar cloud that exists as part of the star formation region, where the number density of lost planets is quite large. According to modern concepts, confirmed by isotope analysis, the solar system at an early stage of its life was in a stellar association formed during the fragmentation of a single giant cloud. Subsequently, this association dissipated as a result of dynamic processes. \n\nThe 9th planet, the evidence of which on the periphery of the solar system was obtained by Batygin et al. [13,14], could be captured both in a planetary system and in a contracting protosolar cloud. It is also possible to capture the PBHs from the Galactic halo into a planetary system or into a contracting cloud. However, the PBH capture probability is extremely small due to the large velocity dispersion of the objects in Galactic halo. \n\nThis work is supported by the Russian Science Foundation grant 23-22-00013, https://rscf.ru/en/project/23-22-00013/",

We assumed that it is a smaller version of Uranus and Neptune. \nAims. We modeled the temporal evolution of the radius, temperature, intrinsic luminosity, and the blackbody spectrum of distant ice giant planets. The aim is also to provide estimates of the magnitudes in di\u21b5erent bands to assess whether the object might be detectable. \nMethods. Simulations of the cooling and contraction were conducted for ice giants with masses of 5, 10, 20, and 50 M that are located at 280, 700, and 1120 AU from the Sun. The core composition, the fraction of H/He, the e ciency of energy transport, and the initial luminosity were varied. The atmospheric opacity was set to 1, 50, and 100 times solar metallicity. \nResults. We find for a nominal 10 M planet at 700 AU at the current age of the solar system an e\u21b5ective temperature of 47 K, much higher than the equilibrium temperature of about 10 K, a radius of 3.7 R , and an intrinsic luminosity of 0.006 LX. It has estimated apparent magnitudes of Johnson V, R, I, L, N, Q of 21.7, 21.4, 21.0, 20.1, 19.9, and 10.7, and WISE W1-W4 magnitudes of 20.1, 20.1, 18.6, and 10.2. The Q and W4 band and other observations longward of about 13 \u03bcm pick up the intrinsic flux. \nConclusions. If candidate Planet 9 has a significant H/He layer and an e cient energy transport in the interior, then its luminosity is dominated by the intrinsic contribution, making it a self-luminous planet. At a likely position on its orbit near aphelion, we estimate for a mass of 5, 10, 20, and 50 M a V magnitude from the reflected light of 24.3, 23.7, 23.3, and 22.6 and a Q magnitude from the intrinsic radiation of 14.6, 11.7, 9.2, and 5.8.

As a last non-nominal model with M=10 M \u2295 , we also examined the possibility that candidate Planet 9 might be a super-Earth without any significant atmosphere and an Earth-like interior. We found that the planet would have a radius of about 1.9 R \u2295 . Assuming that the silicate mantel has a chondritic abundance of radionuclides (Mordasini et al. 2012), we found that its radiogenic luminosity is at the current age of the solar system about 6.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 L , which is remarkably only eight times lower than the total luminosity in the nominal case and about five times higher than the Earth's intrinsic luminosity (Kamland Collaboration et al. 2011). For the Earth it is estimated that about half of the intrinsic luminosity is radiogenic, and the other half originates from delayed secular cooling. The effective temperature is 38 K, only 9 K lower than in the nominal case because of the smaller radius, and the apparent magnitudes in V and Q are 23.2 and 15.2. \n\nEffect of the mass. In the bottom right panel of Fig. 3 we show apparent magnitudes in the V and Q band for the nominal planet and planets where the mass relative to the nominal case was varied.

Since in the V band the reflected light of the Sun is visible, the objects become slightly brighter with time, corresponding to the evolution of the Sun. By contrast, the Q band shows the intrinsic radiation of the planet, and the planets slowly become fainter as a result of cooling. In addition to the nominal 10 M \u2295 case, the apparent magnitude evolution is shown in the figure for planets of 5, 20, and 50 M \u2295 .

The survivability of Planet Nine due to passing stars has also been investigated (Li & Adams 2016). Additional planets which orbit the Sun also could exist but evidence for their presence has yet to be marshalled. \n\nTwo points not emphasized in the above studies are: (1) how our knowledge of the fate of the Solar system changes with the presence of planets beyond Neptune's orbit, and (2) the deeper fundamental issue of what the implications are for similarly-constructed systems and more generally exoplanetary science.

Planets are formed as by-products of star formation processes, resulting in the formation of a planetary system around a central star or central multiple stars. \n\nOur solar system consists of one single star, the Sun, and eight planets. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are the closest to the Sun (approximately 0.4 to 1.5 AU, where 1 AU is the mean distance between the Sun and Earth) and the lowest-mass planets (approximately 0.06 to 1.0 Earth masses). They are mainly composed of rocks and are called rocky planets or Earth-like planets. Jupiter and Saturn are situated in the middle of the solar system (approximately 5.2 and 9.6 AU) and are the most massive planets (approximately 320 and 95 Earth masses). They are mainly composed of gas and are thus called gas giant planets, or Jovian planets. Uranus and Neptune are the furthest planets (approximately 19 and 30 AU) and are of median mass (approximately 15 and 17 Earth masses). They are mainly composed of ice and are thus called icy giant planets, or Neptunian planets. Pluto, recently flown-by and directly imaged in detail by the New Horizons mission, is not a planet, but rather has been categorized as a dwarf planet since 2006. \n\nThis configuration of our planets has been fairly well explained by the \"standard\" planet formation theory (see Section 2), which was based on the sole known example of our Solar System. We do not know whether this planetary configuration is universal or not. \n\nThe first 20 years of indirect planet hunting observations have detected about 1900 exoplanets and more than 3500 candidates (see http://exoplanet. eu/ and http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/kepler). This success has largely been due to the precise radial velocity (RV) method and accurate transit photometry, especially by the Kepler mission, which discovered 4700 exoplanets including candidates. Figure 1 summarizes the distribution of exoplanets discovered by various techniques as of November 2015, except for the Kepler planets whose masses are not yet determined.",

            "text": "In the past decade, numerical simulations started to reveal the possible existence of Planet Nine in our solar system. The Planet Nine scenario can provide an excellent explanation for the clustering in orbital elements for Kuiper Belt objects. However, no optical counterpart has been observed so far to verify the Planet Nine scenario. Therefore, some recent studies suggest that Planet Nine could be a dark object, such as a primordial black hole. In this article, we show that the probability of capturing large trans-Neptunian objects by Planet Nine to form a satellite system in the scattered disk region (between the inner Oort Clouds and the Kuiper Belt) is large. By adopting a benchmark model of Planet Nine, we show that the tidal effect can heat up the satellites significantly, which can give sufficient thermal radio flux for observations, even if Planet Nine is a dark object. This provides a new, indirect way for examining the Planet Nine hypothesis and revealing the basic properties of Planet Nine.",

            "text": "Planet 9 \n\nOver the last decade scientific evidence with simulations have indicated that a large Neptune sized planet was created, during the formation of the solar system, and then during the period of the giant planet migration, about 4 Ga ago, was scattered into the distant solar system. This planet is known by the name of Planet 9 or Planet X with a mass of 5-10 Earth masses. Simulations indicate that Planet 9 could have been scattered initially into a highly eccentric orbit and over time, by an unknown process, was circularized to about 400-800 AU (Batygin (2019)). Today the clues as to the current location of Planet 9 are found in the most distant Kuiper belt objects (KBO), which have been perturbed into highly elliptical orbits, within approximately the same plane, and have an unexpected clustering in their arguments of perihelion that can only reasonably be explained by a dynamical interaction with the proposed Planet 9 (Batygin (2016)). Analysis of the scattered KBOs led to a prediction as to the location in the sky where Planet 9 maybe found to be near the galactic plane in the direction of Orion. \n\nThis proposed Planet 9 is orbiting the Sun at such a distance that F G,S may have a substantial effect on its motion over time. Several aspects should now be reconsidered. Assuming the nominal magnitude, FG = 1.8 x 10 \u221210 m/s 2 (GC centred) and the length of time it has been in the distant solar system of \u223c 4 Ga, then it could have moved into an orbit that is substantially different than expected or could have even escaped the solar system all together. The analysis of this problem requires a lengthy analysis that is beyond the scope of this paper.",

            "text": "The solar system has a surprising architecture compared to other planetary systems that have been glimpsed so far. The Sun hosts four terrestrial planets within 1.5 AU, followed by the asteroid belt at 2-3 AU. Beyond the 'snow line' at roughly 2.7 AU, where water ice was stable in the Sun's protoplanetary disk in a near-vacuum, is Jupiter at 5.2 AU, the most massive and most dynamically dominant planet in the solar system. Beyond Jupiter, the remaining three outer planets become less massive and more metal rich. Notably, all eight planets in our solar system orbit in the same direction as the rotation of the Sun, and all have nearly circular orbits. Beyond the orbit of Neptune lies another belt of relatively small objects, the Kuiper belt, which is estimated to be substantially more massive than the asteroid belt.  Ocean glint causes Earth-like planets to appear brighter and redder at crescent phase than predicted without oceans (adapted from Robinson (2017) based on the validated model described in Robinson et al. (2011). Apparent albedo is defined as the albedo a Lambert sphere (with radius equal to the planetary radius) would need to reproduce the observed brightness of the planet, and values larger than unity imply forward scattering.\n\nThis architecture was fairly clearly explained in a number of papers before the discovery of exoplanets (e.g., Kokuba andIda 1998, Pollack et al. 1996). These models invoked in situ formation of the planets within the Sun's protoplanetary disk to explain the features of our solar system, with little-to-no migration of the planets from their birth sites. Granted, theorists had identified a number of problems with this simplistic model (e.g., Weidenschilling 1995), but they all seemed surmountable.\n\nThe discovery of 51 Peg b (Mayor and Queloz 1995), a giant exoplanet with a mass similar to Jupiter's but with an orbital period of only ~4 days (the first example of a what is now known as a \"hot Jupiter\"), led to the questioning of the entire paradigm of solar system formation models. Models generically predict that gas giant planets (primarily made of hydrogen and helium) must form beyond the snow line (e.g., Lin et",

More specifically, we are interested in understanding whether the planetary and orbital properties in our solar system are typical or extremely unusual compared to those of extrasolar planets.\n\nThe solar system contains eight planets and two main belts (the asteroid belt and the Kuiper Belt). While tens of debris disks and warm dust belts (similar perhaps to the solar system\u02bcs asteroid belt) have been observed and resolved, belts with dust masses as low as those in the solar system would currently be undetectable in extrasolar systems (e.g., Wyatt 2008;Pani\u0107 et al. 2013). Consequently, we can quantitatively assess in detail how special the solar system is, only on the basis of its planetary components and properties such as its age and metallicity. However, there are now hundreds of unresolved debris disk candidates (e.g., Chen et al. 2014). Of these, about two-thirds are better modeled by a two-component dust disk rather than a single dust disk. The two temperature components likely arise from two separate belts (Kennedy & Wyatt 2014). Thus, the two belt configuration of our own solar system is plausibly fairly typical. Beer et al. (2004) made an initial attempt to explore to what extent Jupiter\u02bcs periastron could be considered atypical compared to that of the giant planets known at the time. Their analysis, however, only included fewer than 100 exoplanets, most of which had been detected via radial velocity measurements. Consequently, selection effects dominated their conclusions-a possibility fully acknowledged by the authors. In the present work we re-examine the question of how special the solar system is. In Section 2 we use the much larger currently available database to consider the planetary orbital parameters.\n\nWe identify the semi-major axis of the innermost planet as the most discrepan",

To this goal, we employ a mathematical transformation that allows for a meaningful, statistical comparison. We find that the masses and densities of the giant planets in our solar system are very typical, as is the age of the solar system. While the orbital location of Jupiter is something of an outlier, this is most likely due to strong selection effects toward short-period planets. The eccentricities of the planets in our solar system are relatively small compared to those in observed exosolar systems, but are still consistent with the expectations for an 8-planet system (and could, in addition, reflect a selection bias toward high-eccentricity planets). The two characteristics of the solar system that we find to be most special are the lack of super-Earths with orbital periods of days to months and the general lack of planets inside of the orbital radius of Mercury. Overall, we conclude that, in terms of its broad characteristics, our solar system is not expected to be extremely rare, allowing for a level of optimism in the search for extrasolar life.",

            "text": "The planets of our Solar System are divided into two main classes: the terrestrial planets, populating the inner Solar System, and the giant planets, which dominate the outer Solar System. The giant planets, in turn, can be divided into the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, whose mass is mostly constituted of H and He, and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune, whose bulk composition is instead dominated by the combination of the astrophysical ices H 2 O, NH 3 and CH 4 with metals and silicates. While H and He constitute more than 90% of the masses of the gas giants, they constitute no more than 15-20% of those of the ice giants (Lunine 1993). The terrestrial planets and the gas giants have been extensively studied with ground-based observations and with a large numbers of dedicated space missions. The bulk of the data on the ice giants, on the contrary, has been supplied by the NASA mission Voyager 2, which performed a fly-by of Uranus in 1986 followed by one of Neptune in 1989. \n\nThe giant planets likely appeared extremely early in the history of the Solar System, forming across the short time-span when the Sun was still surrounded by a circumstellar disk of gas and dust and therefore predating the terrestrial planets. The role of the giant planets in shaping the formation and evolution of the young Solar System was already recognized in the pioneering works by Oort and Safronov in 1950-1960. In particular, Safronov (1969) suggested that Jupiter's formation would have injected new material, in the form of planetesimals scattered by the gas giant, in the formation regions of Uranus and Neptune. More recently, a revised interpretation of planetary formation, obtained by studying extrasolar planetary systems, gave rise to the idea that the Solar System could have undergone a much more violent evolution than previously imagined (e.g. the Nice Model for the Late Heavy Bombardment, Tsiganis et al. 2005), in which the giant planets played a major role in shaping the current structure of the Solar System.",

            "text": "The planets of our Solar System are divided in two main classes: the terrestrial planets, populating the inner Solar System, and the giant planets, which dominate the outer Solar System. The giant planets, in turn, can be divided between the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, whose mass is mostly constituted by H and He, and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune, whose bulk composition is instead dominated by the combination of the astrophysical ices H 2 O, NH 3 and CH 4 with metals and silicates. While in the case of the gas giants H and He constitutes more than 90% of their masses, in the case of the ice giants these gaseous envelopes are more limited, amounting to only 1-4 Earth masses (De Pater and Lissauer 2010). The terrestrial planets and the gas giants have been extensively studied with groundbased observations and with a large numbers of dedicated space missions. The bulk of the data on the ice giants, on the contrary, has been supplied by the Voyager 2 mission, which performed a fly-by of Uranus in 1986 followed by one of Neptune in 1989. \n\nThe giant planets appeared extremely early in the history of the Solar System, forming across the short time-span when the Sun was still surrounded by a circumstellar disk of gas and dust and therefore predating the terrestrial planets. The role of the giant planets in shaping the formation and evolution of the young Solar System was already recognized in the pioneering works by Oort and Safronov in 1950-1960. In particular, Safronov (1969) suggested that the formation of Jupiter would inject new material, in the form of planetesimals scattered by the gas giant, in the formation regions of Uranus and Neptune. More recently, the renewed understanding of planetary formation we obtained by the study of extrasolar planetary systems gave rise to the idea that the Solar System could have undergone a much more violent evolution than previously imagined (e.g. the Nice Model for the Late Heavy Bombardment, Tsiganis et al. 2005), in which the giant planets played the role of the main actors in shaping the current structure of the the Solar System.",

It is not obvious how such a large planet could have made its way into the outer solar system. It could not have formed in situ (Batygin & Brown 2016) and is unlikely to have been captured in the Sun's natal star-forming region (Parker et al. 2017). However, Thommes et al. (1999) and Levison & Morbidelli (2007) demonstrate that massive protoplanets, forming alongside the ice giants in the early solar system, can be scattered outward onto high eccentricity orbits while the young giants are clearing debris from their orbital domains. Li & Adams (2016) show that the probability of this occurring is \uf0885%. If Planet 9 exists and was formed by such processes, it would be a challenge to explain its currently low (er) eccentricity, which is predicted to be \u223c0.5-0.8 (Batygin & Morbidelli 2017). This is because scattering Planet 9 from the inner solar system onto a high semimajor axis orbit would inevitably leave it with a perihelion still in the region of the giant planets. Could the hypothetical Planet 9 have been scattered outward in the distant past and then decreased its orbital eccentricity via our detachment mechanism? As before, we maximize the interaction term \u03b4 and minimize Planet 9\u02bcs equilibrium eccentricity by assuming that it interacts with a disk equivalent to its mass. If we assume it was scattered from \u223c10 au, it would have an initial eccentricity of = e 0.99 M 0\n\n. It's minimum equilibrium eccentricity would then be = e 0.97 eq M . This value is far higher than Planet 9\u02bcs predicted eccentricity which tells us that Planet 9 could not have reached its current eccentricity via this mechanism. Figure 9. \u03b4 vs. disk mass. The interaction term \u03b4 approaches unity for sufficiently high and low disk masses. The maximum interaction (or transfer of angular momentum) occurs when nm\uf0a0\u223c\uf0a0M. The lowest equilibrium eccentricity a massive body is able to attain is determined by maximizing \u03b4.",

            "text": "Following the discovery of Ceres in 1801, numerous asteroids were discovered at approximately the same orbital distance. The region in which these asteroids were found lies between Mars and Jupiter and it is known as the Asteroid Belt. No planet could form in this region because of the gravitational perturbations of Jupiter that has prevented the accretion of the asteroids into a small planet. Ceres, with its spherical shape of \u223c500 Km radius, is just the largest asteroid and the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. \n\nA curious mathematical relationship linking the four terrestrial inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) and the four giant gaseous outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) exists (Geddes and King-Hele, 1983). The semi-major axes of these eight planets appear to reflect about the asteroid belt. This mirror symmetry associates Mercury with Neptune, Venus with Uranus, Earth with Saturn and Mars with Jupiter. Geddes and King-Hele (1983) found that the mutual relations among the planets could all be approximately given as relations between the mean frequency notes in an octave: b = 2 exp(1/8). \n\nFor example, using the semi-major axis lengths reported in Table 1 for the eight planets and labeling these distances with the first two letters of the planet's name, it is easy to obtain: \n\nwhere we have b 2 \u2248 1.19, and \n\nwhere we have b 12 \u2248 2.83. Combining the equations yields: \n\nand \n\nThese relations relate the four inner and the four outer planets of the solar system. Even if Geddes and King-Hele rule is not perfect, it does suggest the existence of a specific ordered structure in the planetary system where the asteroid belt region plays a kind of mirroring boundary condition between the inner and outer regions of the solar system. Geddes and King-Hele (1983) concluded: \"The significance of the many near-equalities is very difficult to assess.",

            "text": "Fienga et al. (2016) and Holman & Payne (2016) examined the measured Earth-Saturn distance and determined that Planet Nine is likely to have a true anomaly near 117\u00b0(based on the upper limit to the amplitude of the residuals for that distance measurement). In complementary work, Malhotra et al. (2016) evaluated the potential resonant behavior that Planet Nine could invoke in the population of long-period TNOs, and they predicted that Planet Nine should have a semimajor axis of a = 665 au in order to support stability-boosting resonances. Other authors (de la Fuente Marcos et al. 2016;Lawler et al. 2016) have examined the dynamical effects that Planet Nine would have on the populations of objects that exist in the solar system. Finally, additional work was carried out to explain how Planet Nine would fit into our existing picture of the solar system. For example, multiple groups found that the existence of such a ninth planet can be invoked to explain the six-degree obliquity of the Sun (Bailey et al. 2016;Lai 2016;Gomes et al. 2017). Several previous works have also suggested that the mechanism by which Planet Nine shapes the orbits of the TNOs may be orbital resonances (Beust 2016; Malhotra et al. 2016;Millholland & Laughlin 2017).\n\nThe conclusion in  was based only on six of the (at the time) 13 discovered extreme TNOs. These six TNOs (2004VN 112 , 2007TG 422 , 2010GB 174 , 2012VP 113 , 2013 , and Sedna) were chosen because they exhibit clustering in \u03d6 and have > a 250 au, meaning they are expected to be influenced by Planet Nine. Sheppard & Trujillo (2016) also announced the discovery of two new objects (2014 SR 349 and2013 FT 28 ) that also fit into the class of objects used by  to predict the existence of Planet Nine. In order for Planet Nine to be capable of forcing the orbits of the TNOs into aligned configurations, the TNOs must remain dynamically stable on secular timescales, to allow apsidal alignment to occur. Objects whose orbital elements are affected by short-period scattering events can be used to understand the scattering event itself, but not the long",

The distance between the planets and their central star is shown on the x-axis and their mass is shown with the dark circles of different size, given for each planet.\n\nIn the figure, only Jupiter and Saturn are shown, because we do not find any artificial planetary system with the exact mass and location of all the giant planets in our Solar system. Then, the solar system shown in the figure harbours only two giant planets that match with our Solar system. For the formation of the artificial solar system, we assume that \u03b3 = 0.5 and the planetary migration is not considered. As was said, a system with a very large value of \u03b3 does not favour the formation of several giant planets in the same system and is located farther away from the central star. On the other hand, a faster migration rate would locate the planets in the inner disc and the system would become a hot and warm Jupiter system. Thus, a small value of \u03b3 and a slow migration rate are the best conditions when trying to reproduce our Solar system.\n\nLooking at the architecture of the 100 solar systems detected so far (where we include our Solar system), it can be noted that only  five of them have more than one giant planet and, with the exception of our Solar system, all of them harbour two giant planets. Since we do not know if this sample is representative of all solar systems or is due to an observational bias, we analyse statistically our numerical results. Fig. 5 displays histograms showing the percentage of solar systems that harbour one, two or three planets with masses larger than 15 M \u2295 . This figure is analogous to Fig. 2, where the columns show the results when different migration rates are considered and the three rows show the results when different disc profiles are assumed.\n\nThe figure shows that solar systems with two giant planets are pretty common and those with three giant planets are very rare. This is because according to the core instability model a large amount of solid material is needed to form two giant planets. This allows rapid formation of very massive cores, which starts gas accretion, leading to the formation of giant planets. This usually occurs in the snow line region, which is the preferred formation zone for these planets. If the disc is very massive and has a high metallicity, another",

Eventually the solid grains settle into a thin disk, whereupon aggregation into larger bodies begins. Dust grains grow to become pebbles, then boulders, then kilometer-sized and hundred-kilometer-sized planetesimals -comets and asteroids -the building blocks of solid planets. Planet formation has led to the clearing of the sun's disk inside about ~30AU. Many planetesimals in the inner Solar System were incorporated into the present day terrestrial planets, but many persist as 1-to 1000-km asteroids. \n\nPlanetesimals that formed in the region of the gas giants were either incorporated into the planets or rapidly ejected. Most escaped the Solar System entirely, but a large population was captured by stellar and galactic perturbations into the Oort cloud. Oort comets may be gravitationally scattered back into the inner Solar System to appear as dynamically new long-period comets, some of which are eventually captured into Halley-family short-period orbits. \n\nThe heavyweights of our Solar System are the giant gaseous planets. These formed from the planetesimals, like the terrestrial planets, but were able to also incorporate nebular material directly from the protoplanetary disk into their makeup, and were thus able to retain even the most volatile of molecular species found in the proto-solar nebula, like CO, CH 4 , H, and He. With more than 200 known Jupiter-to-Neptune mass planets known to be orbiting other stars, this process of giant-planet formation is clearly ubiquitous. Jupiter and its kin hold clues to understand the processes that govern planets in other planetary systems. \n\nFigure 2.

In this work, we present a targeted observational search for Planet Nine, motivated by a possible gravitational interaction with the interstellar meteoroid responsible for the CNEOS14 bolide. Our observations span two campaigns over 2022 and 2023, covering a 98-square-degree region where Planet Nine's position is most likely if the messenger hypothesis holds. Our data and search methodology, based on the detection of parallax position shifts between consecutive nights, provide 85% confidence exclusion limits for objects with Sloan r-band magnitudes brighter than between 21.0 and 21.4, with an average sensitivity limit of 21.3. No credible Planet Nine candidates were identified within this field and magnitude limits. A caveat to our approach is that it would miss a candidate if its position were affected by scattered light from bright stars in at least one of the nights. However, we estimate that the probability for this is very low, around 0.4%. We discuss several possible reasons for our Planet Nine non-detection. Our study complements prior searches, particularly those using archival survey data that are limited in the Galactic plane or at fainter brightness limits. While our consecutive-night observation approach offers high sensitivity to minimal motion, extending the search for Planet Nine to fainter magnitudes (which may be crucial, according to recent predictions), will require higher sensitivity instrumentation.",

            "text": "the complete outer solar system. The qualitative features of particles' secular evolution remain unchanged: apsidally anti-aligned libration islands are present at high eccentricity on crossing orbits with Planet Nine. The other giant planets' contribution to particle semimajor axis evolution is expected to be negligible compared to Neptune's. This is easily demonstrated by applying the mapping method used in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 to model the influence of the other outer solar system planets.\n\nMost anti-aligned particles in our fiducial simulation have semimajor axes exterior to Planet Nine's. Consequently, in Section 4 we focused on the dynamics of anti-aligned exterior particles. It is straightforward to adapt the mapping model in Section 4.4 to describe the evolution of particles interior to Planet Nine\uf0a0by simply considering stroboscopic snapshots at Planet Nine's perihelion passage rather than the particle's. Many of the qualitative features of the dynamics remain the same as can be seen in the top panel of Figure 8: the phase space consists of regular resonant islands embedded in a chaotic sea caused by close encounters and resonance overlap. The structure of resonance locations repeats between successive N : 1 resonances. (These resonances become progressively more tightly spaced toward smaller semimajor axes at the left of the plot.) While we find that most anti-aligned particles orbit exterior to Planet Nine, the observational sample of clustered TNOs that motivate the Planet Nine\uf0a0hypothesis are mainly interior to Planet Nine's orbit. On its face, this would suggest that our simulations do not support the Planet Nine\uf0a0hypothesis. However, TNOs on orbits exterior to Planet Nine\uf0a0spend a larger fraction of their orbit at distances where they are unobservable. Therefore, there is a strong observational bias toward TNOs on orbits interior to Planet Nine\uf0a0even if there are significantly more on orbits exterior to Planet Nine. Additionally, relaxing our coplanar assumption may reduce Planet Nine's disruptive effect on particles initialized interior to it by allowing particles to avoid close encounters.\n\nEven modest mutual inclinations between TNOs and Planet Nine\uf0a0can yield a rich range of additional dynamical behaviors not captured by coplanar simulations. Three-dimensional simulations produce a chaotic anti-aligned population similar to that seen in",

A number of lines of evidence suggest that the Sun formed in a sizeable cluster of a few thousand stars (see Adams 2010;Pfalzner et al. 2015, for reviews), and previous dynamical studies have shown that orbiting bodies at large radii can be transferred between stars in the slow (\u223c 1 km s \u22121 ) close encounters typical in open clusters (Clarke & Pringle 1993;Kenyon & Bromley 2004;Morbidelli & Levison 2004;Pfalzner et al. 2005;Levison et al. 2010;Malmberg et al. 2011;Belbruno et al. 2012;J\u00edlkov\u00e1 et al. 2015); and we show that it is indeed possible for the Sun to have captured such a planet from another star in a close encounter in its birth cluster. Our study is complementary to the recent work of Li & Adams (2016), who also identify capture in a cluster as a possible source for Planet 9. Whereas these authors consider the capture of planets initially on circular or moderatelyeccentric orbits, we focus on a scenario in which the Sun captures a highly-eccentric planet with a semi-major axis of several hundred au but a pericentre of \u223c 10 au. In Section 2 we present our simulations for the capture of eccentric planets by the Sun; we show how suitable source planets may exist on highly eccentric orbits around their parent star for many Myr during eras of planet-planet scattering in Section 3; and we discuss our results in Section 4.",

            "text": "Currently, there are 8 planets officially identified in our solar system. Most of the newly discovered large astronomical objects outside Neptune are dwarf planets or large asteroids called trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). In view of the TNOs, the new discovery of 2012 VP113 and some potential members of the inner Oort cloud has revealed a strange clustering in orbital elements (Trujilio & Sheppard 2014). The perihelion distance have arguments of perihelia \u03c9 clustered approximately round zero (Trujilio & Sheppard 2014;Batygin & Brown 2016a). Later analysis shows that the chance for this strange clustering due to random is just 0.0007% (Batygin & Brown 2016a). Therefore, a dynamical mechanism involving a new planet located at more than 100 AU has been suggested (Batygin et al. 2019). Many studies have constrained the mass and the orbital properties of the hypothesized planet 9 (P9) (Batygin & Brown 2016b;Sheppard & Trujillo 2016;Gomes, Deienno & Morbidelli 2016;Becker et al. 2018;Sheppard et al. 2019). Current benchmark models suggest that P9 has mass M 9 \u223c 5 \u2212 10M \u2295 , orbital semi-major axis a 9 \u223c 400 \u2212 800 AU and eccentricity e 9 \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.5 (Batygin et al. 2019). However, the in-situ formation of P9 is strongly disfavored so that P9 might be a captured planet from the free-floating objects nearby the solar system (Batygin et al. 2019;Kenyon & Bromley 2016). A more detailed assessment of the probability of capture can be found in Li & Adams (2016). \n\nCurrent benchmark models of P9 suggest that it has a temperature \u223c 40 K and a radius \u223c 3 \u2212 4R \u2295 (Batygin et al. 2019).

In this work, we propose that the primordial nebula-driven process responsible for retention of Jupiter and Saturn at large orbital radii and sculpting Mars\u2019 low mass is also responsible for clearing out the Solar System\u2019s innermost region. Cumulatively, our results place the Solar System and the mechanisms that shaped its unique orbital architecture into a broader, extrasolar context. The statistics of extrasolar planetary systems indicate that the default mode of planet formation generates planets with orbital periods shorter than 100 days and masses substantially exceeding that of the Earth. When viewed in this context, the Solar System is unusual. Here, we present simulations which show that a popular formation scenario for Jupiter and Saturn, in which Jupiter migrates inward from a > 5 astronomical units (AU) to a \u2248 1.5 AU before reversing direction, can explain the low overall mass of the Solar System\u2019s terrestrial planets, as well as the absence of planets with a < 0.4 AU. Jupiter\u2019s inward migration entrained s \u2273 10\u2212100 km planetesimals into low-order mean motion resonances, shepherding and exciting their orbits. The resulting collisional cascade generated a planetesimal disk that, evolving under gas drag, would have driven any preexisting short-period planets into the Sun. In this scenario, the Solar System\u2019s terrestrial planets formed from gas-starved mass-depleted debris that remained after the primary period of dynamical evolution.",

We chose the simplest structure of a debris disk that is initially flat and circular. Our initial conditions are conservative in the sense that disk, that is more inclined or eccentric would have a lower specific angular momentum and therefore would tend to be more influenced by Planet Nine. We have found that a spheroidal structure (TAUS) is created around the Sun at \u223c 1200AU and is surrounded by an inclined disk beyond \u223c 1500AU. \n\nThere is another plausible channel where Planet Nine formed in the disk around the Sun. In this case, we except the disk to be eccentric and inclined. The interaction of Planet Nine with the disk in this scenario goes beyond the scope of this paper. 4.1 New structure in the solar-system \n\nThe TAUS is a spheroidal structure. It does not represent a perfect sphere because the particles' longitude of the ascending nodes is not uniformly distributed. This mean that some parts of the sphere are populated more than others. The number of particles in the TAUS is not well constrained, as it dependence on the initial number of particles in the disk and the specific surface density power law. We assumed the latter to be \u03b3 = \u22121. Unlike the Oort cloud at \u223c 10 5 AU or even the Hills cloud at\u223c 10 4 AU which are far away the TAUS is relatively close and perhaps could be detected by an infrared survey. \n\nFigure 7 implies that at the early stage of the solar system evolution, around 300Myr after formation, there was a spike in the rate of ejected objects from the disk into the inner solar systems, by up to two order of magnitude relative to the current rate. This fact implies that there was an epoch were a large number of objects from the region of \u223c 1000AU crossed the orbits of the planets, similarly to the \"heavy bombardment\" epoch described in the Nice model (Levison et al. 2008).",

Was the migration fast or slow? Smooth or jumpy? Did the planets migrate at the same rate, or form and move at different times? 4 The answer to all these questions may lie in the evidence left behind by that migration -the distribution of the Solar system's small bodies. \n\nIn this work, we present the first preliminary results of a new dynamical study of the influence of planetary migration on the structure of the Solar system's small body reservoirs. In section two, we describe the set-up of our model, and discuss the various migration scenarios we will 1 Objects moving on highly excited orbits have orbits with high eccentricities and/or inclinations. Such orbits stand in stark contrast to the relatively unexcited orbits of the planets in the Solar system. In this work, we use the terms \"dynamically hot\" and \"dynamically cold\", together with talking about \"excited orbits\", when discussing the orbital properties of the Solar system's small body populations. A dynamically hot population is composed of objects moving on excited orbits, whilst a dynamically cold population is one in which the members move on orbits with negligible eccentricity (i.e. on near-circular orbits) and with very low inclinations (i.e. essentially within the plane of the Solar system). 2 Following its reclassification as a dwarf planet, Pluto was added to the list of minor planets, and given the minor planet number 134340. Therefore, technically, it should be referred to as minor planet 134340 Pluto. 3 For brevity, we hereafter use the abbreviation \"MMR\" for mean-motion resonance.",

            "text": "There is a great variation in chemical composition in the different bodies of the solar system. Due to the temperature gradient throughout the solar nebula (see figures in Hartogh et al. 2011;Lis et al. 2013), the D/H ratio varies radially through the disk, as we have also seen in our results (see Figure 4). The same behavior has been observed in the solar nebula from observations of small solar system bodies (Robert et al. 2000): the D/H ratios increase with radial distance from the Sun. Due to sedimentation in the planetary cores and reprocessing in their atmospheres, the D/H ratios in planetary bodies of the solar system are not a direct measure of the pristine D/H ratio.\n\nWhile we can understand the rough composition of most of the planets in the solar system, the more important discussion is the composition of small solar system bodies, i.e., asteroids and comets. Their origin is less constrained, but we can derive boundary conditions from the Grand Tack scenario , the most successful theory of the formation and evolution of the solar system. In this scenario, Jupiter migrated inward after its formation, only to be stopped at \u223c1.5 AU by a mean motion resonance with Saturn, after which both giant planets move back outward to their present positions and before Jupiter had managed to diminish the available material in the inner disk for buildup of the terrestrial planets. In this theory, many of the observed features of the solar system today can be reproduced, such as the smaller mass of Mars . As Jupiter moved through the asteroid belt at \u223c2-3 AU twice, it scattered much of the belt material. This might explain the mix of C-and S-type asteroids in the inner and outer asteroid belts .\n\nCarbonaceous chondrites have measured water D/H ratios very similar to that of Earth's oceans . Comets, or more specifically Oort-family comets, on the other hand, have been observed with enhanced D/H ratios relative to the Earth's oceans. Observations reveal values of \u223c1.8-6.0 \u00d710 \u22124 (see Table 2), an enhancement to the Earth ocean value by a factor of a few. These values would put their formation origin in our models around 10-20 AU. However, new experimental studies of ice sublimation suggest that the D/",

Our method provides a statistical target for planet formation models, no longer requiring the tuning of models to match just one system, e.g., the solar system, TRAPPIST-1, or some other peculiar system of interest. Just as Galileo used the Jovian satellite system as a conceptual model for the Copernican solar system, by looking at a much larger sample of exoplanetary systems, we can begin to see the system-level trends and whether such an identification has strong foundations.",

            "text": "If Velocimetry is applied to our solar system, only Jupiter could be identified. NASA's Kepler mission will solve this problem, scientists hope. \n\nDespite the difficulties encountered in detecting smaller astronomers, astronomers have identified the first land-based planet that does not revolve around the Sun. The discovery, baptized \"poetic\" OGLE 2005-BLG-390Lb, is the extrasolar with the smallest of the masses known so far (only 5.5 times the mass of the Earth) and is located against its star at a distance of two and a half higher than the Sun's Earth. Composed of rocks and almost devoid of atmosphere, it contrasts with the rest of the giant planets, which are gaseous, just like Jupiter. The novelty among extras is different from its suits and other features. The star around which gravitates, at 22,000 light-years from the Earth, is the type of the smallest and weakest of the stars, it is red and its mass represents about one-fifth of the sun's mass. With ten billion years of existence, she is twice as old as our solar system. But as the OGLE 2005-BLG-390Lb is far away from its star, which emits a hundred times less light than our Sun, the amount of energy it receives is very low. Therefore, the surface temperature should not exceed 220\u00b0C Celsius. The planet's soil is composed of rocks and ice, so if we compare it to one of the planets of our solar system, OGLE would resemble Pluto rather than Earth-like astrologers like Earth or Venus. \n\nThe distance between OGLE and the star also raises the problem of the presence of liquid water. The surface temperature is extremely low, the existence of oceans to cover the planet is impossible. But liquid water could be found between a surface frozen crust and a layer of compressed ice that surrounds a stony region (in analogy with Europe, a Jupiter satellite). Maintaining liquid water would depend on the heat generated by the disintegration of the radioactive elements inside the rocks. This internal heating phenomenon takes place in a time frame comparable to the age of the planet.",

            "text": "The outer reaches of the solar system, at distances d\uf0a0\uf0a070 au, remain largely unexplored. Individual objects with orbits exterior to Neptune's-known as trans-Neptunian objects, or TNOs-are challenging to detect; owing to the steep, F\uf0a0\u221d\uf0a01/r 4 diminution of reflected flux, only the brightest such objects have been discovered. Indeed, at the time of writing, fewer than 100 detached Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), with perihelia q\uf0a0\uf089\uf0a040 au and no direct interactions with the known solar system planets, have been discovered.\n\nThese objects, however, are of exceptional interest due to the unique window that they provide into the dynamical evolution of the outer solar system. The observed apsidal and nodal alignment of detached KBOs, combined with the unexpectedly high inclinations and eccentricities of several outer solar system small body populations, has led to the proposition that a ninth, super-Earth sized planet, commonly known as \"Planet Nine,\" may reside in the distant solar system (Trujillo & Sheppard 2014;Batygin & Brown 2016;Malhotra et al. 2016). Dynamical simulations reveal that in order to account for this observed alignment among KBOs, Planet Nine would likely possess a large semimajor axis (a\uf0a0=\uf0a0400-800 au), a high inclination (i\uf0a0=\uf0a015\u00b0-25\u00b0), and a substantial eccentricity (e\uf0a0=\uf0a00.2-0.5; Batygin et al. 2019). The best-fit orbital solution for Planet Nine found by Batygin et al. (2019), with a\uf0a0=\uf0a0500 au and aphelion distance Q\uf0a0=\uf0a0625 au, corresponds to magnitude V\uf0a0=\uf0a019.0-22.2, where the exact value is determined by the planet's location along the orbit and its inferred albedo.\n\nSeveral recent and ongoing searches have placed observational constraints on the properties of Planet Nine. Meisner et al. (2018) applied data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010) to search for the proposed planet at high Galactic latitudes, ruling out a bright planet (W1\uf0a0<\uf0a016.7, where the W1 bandpass is centered at 3.4 \u03bcm) at 90% completeness over 3\u03c0\uf0a0radians on the",

Moreover, HR8799 is perhaps currently one of the most promising systems for understanding the formation of the Solar System, as both harbour four giant planets in addition to internal and external populations of debris. \n\nThe outer belt around HR8799 has recently been subject to observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) (Booth et al. 2016). These observations provide the highest resolution images of the outer belt to date and suggest that the position of the inner edge of the belt is too far out to be carved by dynamical interactions with the outermost known planet. Booth et al. 2016 postulate therefore that an additional planet might be present around HR8799, external to the outermost known planet and below current detection thresholds, which is responsible for the structure  1.

In \u00a73 we use N-body simulations to model how the four known planets interact with the outer planetesimal belt and how well this predicts the ALMA observations. In \u00a74 we include an additional planet in our simulations, which is external to the outermost known planet, to investigate whether the predicted outer belt agrees more strongly with the ALMA observations. In \u00a75 we consider whether this additional planet can replenish the mass of the inner belt, through inward scattering of material from the outer planetesimal belt, before finally summarizing and concluding in \u00a76.",

These achievements were the result of observations dating from ancient times until the present day but were accomplished predominantly through exploratory missions such as Voyager, Galileo, Cassini and many more. The three aforementioned missions provided information about the moons of several planets situated beyond the orbit of Mars. These 'icy moons' have distinctive characteristics, which are unique in our solar system (Lorenz, 2006). \n\nIcy moons are small celestial bodies whose surfaces are partially, if not principally, covered by ice. They exhibit some features similar to planets (Johnson, 2004). Representative bodies of this category include several satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune (Fig. 1). The most remarkable icy moons are, respectively to the planets mentioned, Ganymede, Triton, Miranda and Titan with a variety of size, composition and temperature (Johnson, 2004).

This clustering is not likely to be a result of observational bias (de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2014), and may be explained by one or more planets which exist beyond the orbit of Neptune but are so far invisible to us (Iorio 2014;Luhman 2014;Trujillo & Sheppard 2014;Gomes, Soares & Brasser 2015;Iorio 2015).

            "text": "Over the last decades, the exploration of the outer solar system has produced a wealth of new observations, often surprising, that have reshaped our understanding of the solar system's origin and evolution (Gladman & Volk 2021). Many trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have been discovered and characterized, revealing a vast and diverse population of objects that helped us understand the early stages of the solar system and its planetary migrations (e.g. Tsiganis et al. 2005;Levison et al. 2008;Walsh et al. 2011;Raymond & Morbidelli 2014), but also provides intriguing clues that our current picture is not complete. Something is missing in our understanding of the outer solar system, possibly a still undiscovered large and very distant planet (at least). \n\nThe modern Planet Nine hypothesis, not to be confused with earlier conjectures of new solar system planets, has its roots in the discovery of an extreme TNO population (ETNOs) nearly twenty years ago (Gladman et al. 2002;Brown et al. 2004). This population is characterized by very large semi-major axis (typically a \u2273 150 AU) and perihelia further than the orbit of Neptune (q \u2273 35 AU), which makes them gravitationally detached from the planets. Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) noted a statistically unlikely clustering of orbital parameters in the population of known ETNOs and considered the possibility that a massive \"unseen perturber\" was responsible for the anomaly. The ETNO orbital clustering was further understood by Batygin & Brown (2016), who recognized that the orbits were geometrically aligned in physical space and performed a large number of detailed simulations to constrain the orbital parameters of the hypothetical Planet Nine (e.g., Brown & Batygin 2016;Khain et al. 2018;Brown & Batygin 2021). A recent improvement to this approach by Siraj et al. (2024) selects a sample of ETNOs based on their secular stability and finds a statistically significant apsidal alignment (clustering in longitude of perihelion) at the 3-\u03c3 level in the orbits of the 51 stable or metastable ETNOs currently known.",

            "text": "These can be grouped into two categories: Systems where the largest planets have attained high eccentricities (e.g. A1.7, A1.23), and systems in which, although the planets have low eccentricities, they are more numerous and crowded than in our own terrestrial region (e.g. A1.13, A1.19). \n\nFig. 3 shows a set of plots which summarize the outcomes of all the Set A1 runs in a compact form. First, it shows (top left) a combined plot of all planets in all 30 systems. From this, we see that the majority of planets have eccentricities of a few times 10 \u22122 , comparable to the Solar System. There is a tendency for smaller planets to have lower eccentricities; these are predominantly the members of the group of more crowded systems (i.e. having undergone fewer mergers) mentioned above. \n\nThe figure also shows (top right) a plot of the radial mass concentration versus the angular momentum deficit of each system. Past simulations of late-stage terrestrial planet formation have systematically failed to reproduce values similar to the Solar System for these two key quantities (Chambers 2001), thus we focus on them in quantifying whether or not a given outcome resembles the Solar System. The radial mass concentration is a measure of the degree to which mass is radially localized, used by Chambers (2001): \n\nThe quantity in brackets measures the crowdedness of the system at a given value of r; the value we compute for RM C is the maximum value this quantity takes on throughout the final terrestrial planet system. The angular momentum deficit is a measure of the system's overall deviation from circular, coplanar orbits. In normalized form, it is given by: (Laskar 1997). Plotted values are normalized to the values for the Solar System's terrestrial planets. We choose RM C > 0.5RM C Solar System and AM D < 2AM D Solar System as conditions for a terrestrial planet system to be \"Solar System-like\". Additionally, we impose the conditions that the system contain at least two planets with mass > 0.5 M \u2295 , but not more than four planets in total. Systems which satisfy these two latter conditions are plotted as filled circles.",

            "text": "In the solar system our understanding of the planets is enriched by our understanding of their moons. The Moon is thought to influence Earth's habitability (Laskar et al. 1993). The Galilean moons help constrain the early evolution of Jupiter (Heller et al. 2015;Ronnet et al. 2018). The equatorial alignment of Uranus's moons helps us understand the origin of the planet's tilt (Kegerreis et al. 2018). As a community we would benefit immensely from conducting similar science for moons of extrasolar planets (exomoons).\n\nDetecting analogs of the solar system moons is challenging due to their small size. Photometry is thought to be the most promising technique (Kipping et al. 2009), either through observing individual moon transits (Sartoretti & Schneider 1999), multiple averaged moon transits (Simon et al. 2012;Heller 2014;Teachey et al. 2017), or inferring the moon's existence based on the planet's transit timing variations (TTVs) and transit duration variations (TDVs; Sartoretti & Schneider 1999;Kipping 2009aKipping , 2009bKipping , 2011Heller et al. 2016). Other techniques with potential include gravitational microlensing (Bennett et al. 2014;Hwang et al. 2018) and observations of self-luminous giant exoplanets to detect a variation in polarization (Sengupta & Marley 2016) or in radial velocity (Vanderburg et al. 2018).\n\nThe most plausible exomoon to date is in the Kepler-1625 system. The planet (Kepler-1625b) itself is unremarkable: a gas giant on a 287 day orbit. The surprise, however, is the size of the moon (Kepler-1625b-i), as it is potentially similar in mass and radius to Neptune. Such a large moon is without precedent in our solar system, but one must remember that so were the first exoplanet discoveries.\n\nThe moon was originally suspected based on three planet transits within the original Kepler mission (Teachey et al. 2017;Heller 2018). Asymmetries in the transit profile teased the presence of a moon, but neither TTVs nor TDVs were detected to confirm it. The moon's existence became more likely",

(2011). Comparing our simpler analysis with their more sophisticated calculations still indicates a relatively good agreement: Havel et al. (2011) derive for Kepler-9b and an age of 5 Gyrs as in our calculation a possible range of Z between 0.19 and 0.56, with a nominal value of 0.37. For Kepler-9c, also at 5 Gyr, they derive a Z between 0.17 to 0.58, with a nominal value of 0.37. Our simulations indicate a heavy element fraction for Kepler-9b of 0.24 to 0.30 with a nominal value of 0.25, while for Kepler-9c values of 0.16 to 0.36 with a nominal value of 0.30 are found. The allowed ranges thus agree in the two analyses. The smaller nominal values in our analysis are not surprising, as the effect of additional heating in the envelope of the planet due to stellar irradiation is not taken into account in our simulations. Therefore, lower core masses are sufficient to explain the observed radius. In Havel et al. (2011), the effect of irradiation leads to an uncertainty of about 30% for the value of Z. The error bars in their analysis are larger (and more realistic) because more sources of uncertainties like atmospheric opacities are taken into account. \n\nFor Jupiter, we find that the closest synthetic planet contains about 31 M \u2295 of heavy elements, similar as in Paper I. This is in good agreement with the allowed range for the total amount of heavy elements found by Guillot (1999) of 11 to 41 M \u2295 . For Saturn, the derived heavy element mass is 25.6 M \u2295 , also in good agreement with Guillot (1999) who finds masses between 19 and 31 M \u2295 . For the ice giants, we find that they contain about 10 to 12% of gas, similar as e.g. Hubbard et al. (1991).",

The follow-up observation using Dark Energy Camera (DECam) Imager mounted on the Blanco telescope with 3 deg 2 field of view k can offer a promising opportunity to examine the Keplerian motion of our good candidate pair. Figure 9 in Brown and Batygin (2021) indicates that the predicted r-band magnitude of Planet Nine is less than 26. Such an upper limit of 26 AB mag only needs roughly one hour to reach a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 using the r-band filter of DECam l . Brown, Holman, and Batygin (2024) pointed out that 9 detections are required to evaluate a linked Keplerian orbit with improved processing speed and reduce the number of false positives. The method of the follow-up analysis should be similar to this study. We can start to estimate the expected orbital motion over 18 years (from 2006 to 2024), which varies between 33 \u2032 and 54.7 \u2032 , corresponding to the heliocentric distance range of 500 -700 AU. If the existence of Planet Nine can be confirmed by observations in the near future, it will improve our understanding of the history and structure of the entire solar system in early stages.",

If the HR 8799 system represented low-mass examples of such a population, brown-dwarf companions to young massive stars would be plentiful. Nearby young star surveys [27][28][29] and our nearly-complete survey of 80 stars with similar masses and ages to HR 8799, have discovered no such population of brown dwarf companions. HR 8799e and possibly d are close enough to the primary star to have formed by bottom-up accretion in situ 24 , but planets b and c are located where the collisional time-scale is conventionally thought to be too low for core accretion to form giant planets before the system's gas is depleted. A hybrid process with different planets forming through different mechanisms cannot be ruled out but seems unlikely with the similar masses and dynamical properties of the four planets. It is possible that one mechanism dominated the other and the planets later migrated to their current positions. \n\nThe HR 8799 debris disk is especially massive for a star of its age or any older age main sequence star 17 , which could indicate an extremely dense protoplanetary disk. Such a disk could have induced significant migration, moving planets formed by disk-instability inward or the disk could have damped the residual eccentricity from multi-planet gravitational interactions that moved core-accretion planets outward. The massive debris disk and the lack of higher-mass analogs to this system do suggest that HR 8799 represents the high-mass end of planet formation. The HR 8799 system does show interesting similarities with the Solar system with all giant planets located past the system's estimated snow line (~2.7 AU for the Solar system and ~6 AU for HR 8799) and their debris belts located at similar equilibrium temperatures (see Figure 4). With its more massive planets, massive debris belts and large scale, the HR 8799 planetary system is also an amazing example of Nature's ability to produce extreme systems. \n\nReceived November 5 th , 2010; accepted November 18, 2010.",

Following the set-up in Khain et al. (2018a), we carry out N-body integrations that span 4 Gyr of integration time, and utilize the mercury6 software package (Chambers 1999), employing the hybrid Wisdom-Holman/ Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm.\n\nWe consider a simplified model of the solar system, which includes Neptune and Planet Nine as active bodies, but replaces Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus with a solar J 2 moment as in Batygin & Brown (2016). That is, we account for the gravitational potential of the three planets by adding a nonzero quadrupolar field to the Sun, and extending its radius to Uranus' semimajor axis. This approximation of the giant planets as a quadrupolar term on the Sun's potential has been used commonly in the literature in order to make the computational problem more tractable (ex: Batygin & Brown 2016;Batygin & Morbidelli 2017;Millholland & Laughlin 2017;Becker et al. 2018;Eriksson et al. 2018;Khain et al. 2018a), although we note that some works insetad use fully active particles for the giant planets (ex: de la Fuente Marcos et al. 2016;Shankman et al. 2017;C\u00e1ceres & Gomes 2018;Clement & Kaib 2020). In all works mentioned above, the TNOs are treated as non-interacting particles, whose orbits are affected by the gravitational influence of the star and planets but not each other. The treatment of TNOs as massless 5 test particles represents well the true behavior of TNOs since the outer solar system has a very low density of objects and TNOs are not signficantly pertrubed by other TNOs.\n\nIn our semi-averaged model, we introduce a non-inclined 10 m \u2295 Planet Nine with semimajor axis a 9 \uf0a0=\uf0a0700 au, eccentricity e 9 \uf0a0=\uf0a00.6, and set the timestep to 16 yr (one-tenth of Neptune's orbital period).

However, we choose to neglect the planet in the remainder of this study as it would lead to more complex dynamical behaviour of the additional, fictitious terrestrial world that is under investigation in this work. Its role is subject to an ongoing investigation. We perform simulations of an aquaplanet (fully water-covered planet) on a variety of orbits to find habitable climates for fixed CO 2 concentrations both in the Kepler-35 and in our own solar system for reference. The planet is deemed uninhabitable, if either the planet becomes fully ice covered at the surface (so-called 'Snowball state') or the limit of upper atmospheric water vapour for rapid loss of water (so-called 'Moist Greenhouse state') is exceeded 15,16 .\n\nBy comparing key atmospheric indicators of the circumbinary planet with results from a planet on a circular orbit around a sunlike star, we find that the periodic forcing of the atmosphere alters the planet's climate. Signatures of the binary's as well as the planet's periods can be found in most climate indicators such as global-mean precipitation and global-mean temperatures. Understanding the climate of planets with periodic variations in insolation is thus crucial to interpreting observations of such planets correctly. The mean climate of the circumbinary planet is similar to that of an identical planet in our solar system, although the planet is slightly cooler in a priori cold states.",

We note that terrestrial planets may exist inside the warm belt of HR 8799; those would not be detectable using current telescopes. \n\nThe interaction between the giant planets of HR 8799 and the debris belts have been studied by Contro et al. (2015Contro et al. ( , 2016)); Read et al. (2018); Go\u017adziewski & Migaszewski (2018). Numerical simulations by Contro et al. (2016) indicate that the inner belt is structured, with gaps at the locations of mean motion resonances with the innermost planet similar to the Kirkwood gaps in the MAB. Moreover, the simulations suggest that the belt is located between 6 AU and 8 AU and collisions within the belt occur at velocities of the order of 1.2 km/s or less, lower than the collisional velocities in the MAB, which are of order 5 km/s.",

            "text": "all such predictions have been fruitful: Nemesis, a hypothetical red dwarf companion to the Sun with semimajor axis a N \u223c 10 5 au (Davis et al. 1984), was invoked to explain periodic extinctions in the fossil record and provides a cautionary example. 4 As outlined below, this Letter places significant constraints on possible formation scenarios and dynamical histories for Planet Nine.\n\nDynamical scattering interactions between the solar system and passing stars can take place over a wide range of parameter space. This paper focuses on interactions that affect the orbit of Planet Nine, which we consider to be dynamically decoupled from the rest of the solar system. Specifically, the giant planets (Jupiter through Neptune) are too far inside the orbit of Planet Nine to affect its dynamics during close encounters, whereas KBOs have too little mass. The results of this Letter support this decoupling hypothesis (Section 2).\n\nHere, we consider two background environments for scattering interactions: the solar birth cluster and the field. Most stars form within stellar clusters of some type (Lada & Lada 2003;Porras et al. 2003). Based on its observed properties, including radioactive enrichment levels and wellordered orbits, our solar system is likely to have formed within a cluster containing N * = 10 3 \u2212 10 4 members (Adams & Laughlin 2001;Portegies Zwart 2009;Adams 2010;Pfalzner 2013); these same considerations suggest that the time spent in the birth cluster is \u223c100 Myr (see also Pfalzner et al. 2015). Within the cluster, with relative velocity dispersion v b \u223c 1 km s \u22121 , the Sun samples a range of stellar densities, with mean * \u00e1 \u00f1\u00f1 100 pc \u22123 . After leaving its birth environment, the solar system has lived an additional \u223c4.5 Gyr in the solar neighborhood, which is characterized by stellar density * \u00e1 \u00f1\u00f1 0.1 pc \u22123 and velocity v b \u223c 40 km s \u22121 (Binney & Tremaine 2008). Although the solar system spends more time in the diffuse environment of the field, interactions are more likely in the solar birth cluster due to the increased stellar density and larger cross sections (smaller v b ).\n\nSeveral types of scattering interactions are of interest. First, because planet formation is difficult on wide orbits (Dodson-Robinson",

As we move from planet detection toward detailed characterization and ultimately a search for life on these transiting planets, a natural question arises: would theoretical observers in a particular planetary system be able to detect any planets in   our own solar system via transits? We define any transiting planet geometrically capable from their perspective of seeing at least one solar system planet transit as a reciprocally transiting planet. \n\nAll reciprocally transiting planets will be located near the ecliptic along the eight planes of our solar system planets' orbits. Because K2 is the first and only space-based transit mission to observe along the ecliptic to date, K2 planets will dominate the known population of reciprocally transiting planets (at least until a potential TESS extended mission along the ecliptic). This idea was first explored by Wells et al. (2018), who identified 68 known planets or planet candidates (not all of which transit) around 50 unique stars in zones of the sky that could detect at least one solar system planet's transit; only seven had been discovered via K2. \n\nAmong the 818 planet candidates presented here, 154 of them (around 138 stars) are reciprocally transiting; 73 of these are new planet candidates in this work. Just one system, the previously known K2-101 b (EPIC 211913977, presented in Wells et al. 2018), can detect three transiting solar system planets: it is in the two-in-a-million alignment capable of observing transits of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Nineteen other single-planet systems (nine of them new in this work) are reciprocally transiting with two solar system planets. \n\nAmong our multiplanet systems, nine of our two-planet systems are capable of seeing one of our solar system planets transit. The previously known and validated three-planet system K2-58 (EPIC 206026904) would be able to see transits of Venus. The four-planet system EPIC 211939692 (all new planet candidates in this work) is capable of seeing Jupiter and Saturn transit from its perspective.",

The  version of Planet Nine functions by explaining both the apsidal and ascending node alignment of a selection of objects in the Kuiper Belt. The objects under consideration in  were two overlapping sets of objects: first, those that have perihelion distance > q 30 au and semimajor axis > a 150 au, while being dynamically stable in the presence of Neptune; second, any objects that have > q 30 au and semimajor axis > a 250 au, all of which exhibit clustering in \u03d6 (when \u03d6 is defined as the longitude of perihelion, v w = + W). The orbit for Planet Nine presented in  was a rough estimate, with semimajor axis a = 700 au, eccentricity e = 0.6, inclination i = 30\u00b0, longitude of ascending node \u03a9 = 113\u00b0, and argument of perihelion w = 150\u00b0. The authors estimated the planet to have a mass of roughly 10 Earth masses, but all of these orbit predictions were noted as approximate. This mass estimate was supported in a follow-up effort by the predicting authors , which placed constraints on the orbital elements of the potential Planet Nine by using N-body simulations to determine which Planet Nine realizations lead to clustered TNOs in simulations. In this work, the authors determined that a 10-Earth-mass Planet Nine was more likely to recreate the observed clustering than a 20-Earth-mass Planet Nine.\n\nThe possibility of a new planet has led to a great deal of recent work, for example, to evaluate the likelihood of Planet Nine's existence given the known properties of the solar system. For example, Fienga et al. (2016) and Holman & Payne (2016) examined the measured Earth-Saturn distance and determined that Planet Nine is likely to have a true anomaly near 117\u00b0(based on the upper limit to the amplitude of the residuals for that distance measurement).

Space exploration, for example, is a perfect example of when we need to know the exact positions of the planets in our solar system. Since it takes many years to send a rover or satellite to a planet, we will need to be able to predict the position of that planet many years into the future. Therefore, I present a second order Runge-Kutta simulation to predict the future position and velocity of the planets in our solar system based on Newtonian laws of motion. The equations of motion are implemented into a Mathematia script which animates the motion of each planet by generating a single static plot at each iteration within the while loop, stepping forward in time, re-plotting overtop the previous frame. This step-by-step numerical simulation is typically overlooked as an animation technique available in Mathematica.

            "text": "The continued unveiling of the outer solar system by astronomical surveys has revealed a puzzling orbital clustering among the distant Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs). Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) were the first to note a peculiar grouping in the argument of perihelion of long-period KBOs. Subsequently, Batygin & Brown (2016a) found that the orbits of KBOs with semimajor axes a\uf0a0\uf089\uf0a0250 au and perihelion distances q\uf0a0>\uf0a030 au are in fact anomalously aligned in physical space, i.e., these objects exhibit statistically significant clustering in longitude of perihelion as well as ascending node. To explain this persistent orbital grouping, Batygin & Brown (2016a) proposed the existence of a Neptune-like perturber-\"Planet Nine\"-that is apsidally anti-aligned with the aforementioned KBOs and generates their orbital confinement through a complex interplay of resonant and secular effects (Batygin & Morbidelli 2017;Becker et al. 2017).\n\nWhile this orbital clustering constitutes the most visually striking line of evidence for the existence of Planet Nine , it is by no means the only one. In particular, the detachment of high perihelion (q\uf0a0\uf089\uf0a036 au) KBOs from Neptune requires an extra gravitational influence, which a distant perturber can successfully provide. In addition, Planet Nine naturally explains the dynamics of highly inclined large semimajor axis centaurs (Gomes et al. 2015;Batygin & Brown 2016a), as well as retrograde KBOs with a\uf0a0<\uf0a0100 au, such as Drac and Niku (Batygin & Brown 2016b). Lastly, the presence of an inclined distant planet in our solar system and the associated secular torque can explain the otherwise mysterious six-degree obliquity of the Sun (Bailey et al. 2016;Lai 2016; Gomes et al. 2017).\n\nGiven the inferred distant and eccentric orbit of Planet Nine, a natural question that arises concerns its formation. To this end, three main mechanisms have been considered in the literature. In the first scenario, Planet Nine is captured into its current orbit, either from another solar system, or as a freefloating planet (Li & Adams 2016;Mustill et",

The result is the number of moons increase for the soil planets as we go further from the Sun while this number decrease for the gaseous planets with distance from the Sun which means that the distribution of moons of the soil planets is directly proportional to their distance from the Sun but have no relation with their mass whereas for the gaseous planets, the number of moons of the planets decreases with increasing their distance from the Sun and decreasing their mass.

In the favored core accretion theory, the gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn are believed to form through the accumulation of small icy planetesimals into solid cores of about 5-15 M \u2295 in the region beyond the snow line at a snow \u2248 2.7(M h /M e ) (Ida & Lin 2004;Laughlin et al. 2004;Kennedy et al. 2006), where the protoplanetary disk is cold enough for ices (especially water-ice) to condense. However, such a scenario cannot form smaller ice giants like Uranus and Neptune at their current orbital positions, due to the low density of planetesimals and slow evolution in these orbits (Pollack et al. 1996). One idea is that Uranus and Neptune formed in the Jupiter-Saturn region between \u223c5 and \u223c17 au, then migrated outwards to their current positions (Fernandez & Ip 1984;Thommes et al. 1999;Helled & Bodenheimer 2014).\n\nThe formation of super-Earth exoplanets with a Neptune-like orbit is even less understood. This is partly because we do not even know if they exist, unlike in the case of Neptune. They are also not expected based on the standard core accretion theory for the same reason as the ice giants mentioned above (Ida & Lin 2004). Their formation may be similar or related to the formation of Neptune-like ice giants.\n\nThe distribution of such cold ice-giant planets and super-Earths in other solar systems is important for understanding the formation of our own cold ice giants. Also, in our own solar system, the distribution of Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) is dominated by gravitational interactions with Neptune. Since KBOs hold large amounts of water and other volatiles needed for life, it could be that exo-Neptunes play an important role in the development of life in some exoplanetary systems, whether or not they play this role in our own solar system.\n\nIn the 20 years since the first exoplanet discovery (Mayor & Queloz 1995), there have been repeated discoveries of planets that are quite different from those in our own Solar System. However, the detection of planets similar to those in our own Solar System has been more difficult.",

            "text": "The HR 8799 system is a directly imaged system of four self-luminous giant planets in orbit around a young, chemically peculiar, debris disk hosting A-type star. The system presents a number of challenges to our understanding of planet formation and evolution, and has remained emblematic since its discovery. The photometric variability and chemical peculiarity of HR 8799 A was noted during the late 20th century (Gehren 1977;Schuster & Nissen 1986;Rodriguez & Zerbi 1995), and the star was subsequently classified as an A-type \u03bb Bootis (meaning sub-solar iron-peak abundances, but nearsolar C, N, O, S abundances), \u03b3 Dor variable (Zerbi et al. 1999;Gray & Kaye 1999;Moya et al. 2010;Wright et al. 2011;S\u00f3dor et al. 2014;Wang et al. 2020a;Sepulveda et al. 2023;Hubrig et al. 2023). The system's parallax as determined by the Gaia spacecraft is \u03c0 = 24.462\u00b10.0455 mas (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022), which corresponds to a distance of 40.80\u00b10.08 pc. HR 8799 A's proper-motion makes it a probable, though somewhat isolated, member3 of the \u223c 40 Myr Columba association (e.g., Doyon et al. 2010;Zuckerman et al. 2011;Bell et al. 2015;Gagn\u00e9 et al. 2018). The star's radius has been measured with optical interferometry (R \u22c6 = 1.44 \u00b1 0.06 R \u2299 ), which provides a precise age and mass constraint when coupled with literature pho-tometry and distance measurements (33 +7 \u221213 Myr and M \u22c6 = 1.516 +0.038 \u22120.024 M \u2299 , Baines et al. 2012). In addition, the star's mass has been estimated using the Keplerian orbits of the 4 known giant planets (1.43 +0.06 \u22120.07 M \u2299 , Sepulveda & Bowler 2022).",

            "text": "The makeup of our Solar System differs from most exoplanetary systems found to date, even after accounting for observational biases (e.g.Winn and Fabrycky 2015; Horner et al. 2020).The stable circular orbits of the planets in our own Solar System suggest that they formed on paths similar to their present-day orbits, with no significant changes.In contrast, the majority of exo-solar systems exhibit minimal resemblance to our well organised Solar System as they often host planets that could not form in-situ, such as close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes (e.g.Howard et al. 2010), and many other objects showing evidence for past significant planet-planet interactions (e.g.Juri\u0107 and Tremaine 2008;Carrera et al. 2019;Bowler et al. 2020).Consequently, the peculiarity of the Solar System in the context of extra-solar planets appears to be intimately linked to two key processes: orbital migration and dynamical instabilities.However, as it is discussed in the previous sections, orbital migration and dynamical instabilities can lead to planet engulfment events whichin turn -can be responsible of specific variations in the chemical pattern of stars.\n\nGiven these premises, it is tempting to search for a possible connection between the unusually ordered architecture of the Solar System to the chemical pattern of the Sun in comparison with those of other stars: is the chemical composition of the Solar atmosphere anomalous?If so, can this presumed anomaly be somehow liked to the unusual architecture of the Solar System?Finding answers to these questions is an extremely difficult challenge because -contrarily to stellar components of binary systems -there are no stars against which we can compare our Sun to determine whether it has an anomalous composition or not.The best strategy one can possibly embrace is to compare our Sun to the other stars in the Solar vicinity.However, note that process of stellar migration and Galactic chemical evolution -if neglected -could lead us to wrong conclusions.\n\nFollowing this approach Mel\u00e9ndez et al. (2009) compared the chemical pattern of the Sun to that of 11 Sun-like stars finding that the Sun has indeed a peculiar chemical composition, characterised by a lower refractory-to-volatile abundance ratio.",

These are celestial bodies that fulfill the new definitions of planet. We have not considered in these analysis trans-Neptunian objects or small Solar System bodies, due to their negligible effects on the global system dynamics. \n\nTable 1 presents the values of the parameters used to evaluate the phase curves for the planets of the Solar System. Complementary, Table 2 includes some average physical values related to the Sun. Data from Tables 1 and 2 reflect the fact that our planetary system is clearly a non-compact planetary system. \n\nDespite of its main characteristics, the Solar System could easily be compared with some compact systems, e.g. with Kepler-11, which has 6 planets concentrated in a radius \u223c 0.250AU around their host star [3], or with TRAPPIST-1, with 7 planets within a radius of \u223c 0.063AU from their central star [4]. Kepler multi-planetary system can be considered to have a quasicircular orbit [10]. In fact, an important eccentricity in a multi-planetary system is generally due to the presence of a hot Jupiter that has enough mass to perturb neighborhood bodies during its migration. These kind of orbital influence is not present in the case of our Solar System. The orbital eccentricities (e) of the Solar System planets are relatively weak, except for Mercury (e \u223c 0.206). Furthermore, the orbits are quasi-coplanar with the only exception, once again, of Mercury. This planet has an orbit inclination of \u223c 7.005 \u2022 with respect to the ecliptic plane. On the other hand, in the Solar System, the orbital periods (P ) vary from 88 days (Mercury) to 165 years (Neptune). Meanwhile, in compact multi-planetary systems, P are commonly few days [3,4]. Another interesting feature is the location of the habitable zone; it depends on the type of the host star. For dwarf-star planetary systems, the habitable zone is located in the neighborhood of the star.",

For example, it is significantly higher if one considers just the giant planets orbital periods instead of their position relative to the system's habitable zone as key to architectural characterization; considering as analogs those systems composed of inner lowermass planets and outer giants whose orbits are longer than one year this fraction amounts to 15.57% of known multiple systems, and to 19.67% if the lower limit on giant planets orbital period is instead set at 100 days. \n\nAlthough low, this fraction is an encouraging sign that a sizeable number of planetary systems may reproduce our own planetary architecture, featuring at least one gas giant on a long-period orbit and lower-mass planets on inner orbits; another positive clue can be identified in the findings of Ciardi et al. (2013), suggesting that in up to 60% of Kepler candidate planet pairs the innermost one has a smaller radius than the outer body, and that this fraction rises up to 68% if the pair contains one Neptunesized planet. Winn & Fabrycky (2015) also reports that approximately half of Sun-like star host at least one small planet (from 1 to 4 R \u2295 ) with an orbital period less than one year. \n\nDuring the aforementioned preliminary search through the RV-observed known systems we found 229 single-planet systems, 195 of which contain a single long-period (P\u22651 yr) giant and 34 containing a single Neptune-like or super-terrestrial planet. In this context, it is clear that this large fraction of single known long-period giant planet systems may represent an unparalleled opportunity for the search of yet undetected inner, smaller planets and therefore of scaled-down Solar System analogs; however, known systems with giant planets are not usually subject to follow-up observations to search for additional, lower mass planetary companions at short orbital period. Furthermore, the available data published on most of these systems do not provide by itself enough solid ground on which to base such a search, being characterized by a sampling frequency and in some case integration time or instrument setup not suited for detecting low-mass and short period planets.",

When Venus is excluded from the analysis of the inner solar system, there is an additional large peak in the relative likelihood at \u223c190 days, slightly interior to the actual orbit of Venus at 224 days.

            "text": "For decades the solar system was assumed to be the prototype for planetary system formation. With the detection of over a thousand confirmed exoplanets and many more candidates, it has become apparent that many planetary systems exist that differ substantially in their structural properties from our solar system. Nevertheless the formation of the solar system is still of special interest for several reasons. First, it is only for the solar system that we can directly examine material that is left over from the formation process in the form of meteorites. Second, only for the solar system do we have detailed structural information about the entire system including its smaller bodies. Last but not least, it is only for the solar system that we know for sure that life exists.\n\nThe three major sources about the formation of the solar system are meteorites, the present solar system structure and contemporary young planet-forming systems. We start by reviewing the current status of meteorite research concerning the chronology of early solar system formation including the formation of the terrestrial planets in section 2. In this context the question of the origin of short-lived radioactive nuclei in these meteorites is of special interest. Some of these can only be produced in supernovae events of high-mass stars-different possibilities are discussed in section 3.\n\nOther sources of information are young stars surrounded by accretion discs from which planetary systems might form. In section 4 the properties of these discs-masses, gas content and chemical composition-are discussed. Estimates of the life times of these discs are given and the consequences for planet formation scenarios are discussed. Section 5 provides a closer look at the different stages of planet formation. Starting from dust grains, then considering pebble-sized objects to planetismals the current state of research is presented. This is followed by the final step in which planets form.\n\nMany of these young systems are part of a cluster of stars. There are several indications that our own solar system also formed as part of a star cluster. Section 6 gives the arguments for such an early cluster environment and discusses the possibilities of finding today stars that formed in the same cluster as our Sun did. Not only the location and masses of the planets but also those of the asteroid and Kuiper belt are characteristics of our solar system that might potentially give clues to its formation. In section 7 the early dynamical evolution of the Kuiper belt is illustrated. Possible scenarios for the late",

            "text": "Of all the planetary systems known to date, our solar system remains undoubtedly the one for which we have the largest number of accurate observational constraints to be used for modeling the evolution of the giant planets up to their current orbital configuration. \n\nReconstructing this evolution as far back in time as possible is very important, because it can constrain the orbits on which the planets formed, and in turn, shed new light onto their formation mechanism. In particular, knowledge of these aspects may allow us to understand why our solar system looks so different from the extra-solar systems discovered so far. Two differences are particularly striking. First, our giant planets are all far from the Sun, whereas giant planets in the very vicinity of their host stars are numerous in extra-solar systems. Observational biases favor the discovery of these planets, but the very fact that they exist in other systems and not in our own is real and remarkable. Thus, we need to understand in which conditions planets can avoid large-range radial migration towards the central star. Second, the orbital eccentricities of extra-solar planets, including those at distances of several AUs from the central star, are generally much larger than the eccentricities of the giant planets of our system. The latter, equal to several percent, are nevertheless non-negligible. Planet eccentricities are believed to be the result of mutual perturbations (Rasio and Ford, 1996;Marzari and Weidenschilling, 2002). It is important to understand which perturbations are responsible for the moderate eccentricities of the giant planets of the Solar System and why the orbital excitation could be much stronger in most extra-solar cases. \n\nOur group has recently proposed two models that aim to reconstruct two different phases of the evolution of the solar system: the one that was dominated by the gas disk and the one that occurred after the disappearance of the gas. \n\nThe first model addresses specifically the migration of Jupiter and Saturn in the proto-planetary gas disk. If considered individually, these planets should have evolved towards the Sun, as the result of Type II migration. However, Masset and Snellgrove (2001, MS01 hereafter) showed that Saturn tends to get locked in the 2:3 MMR with Jupiter.",

Subsequent analysis of previous imaging data from Keck II in 2007(Metchev et al. 2009), Subaru in 2002 (Fukagawa et al. 2009), and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 1998 ) revealed several pre-discoveries of the HR 8799 planets and confirmed their common proper and orbital motions. Dynamical modeling of this system suggests a small (but non-zero) inclination and two-or three-body resonances among the planets (Go\u017adziewski & Migaszewski 2009;Reidemeister et al. 2009;Fabrycky & Murray-Clay 2010). Thermal emission has been detected from a warm inner debris disk around HR 8799 at \u223c10 AU and an outer massive disk at 100 AU, implying an architecture analogous to our Solar System with giant planets surrounded by \"exo-asteroid\" and \"exo-Kuiper\" belts (Sadakane & Nishida 1986;Mo\u00f3r et al. 2006;Williams & Andrews 2006;Rhee et al. 2007;Chen et al. 2009;Su et al. 2009;Reidemeister et al. 2009).\n\nThe atmospheric properties of the HR 8799 planets have been investigated in several studies. All three planets exhibit redder near-infrared colors than field T dwarfs with similar absolute magnitudes, which suggests the presence of dusty clouds in their atmospheres (Marois et al. 2008b;Metchev et al. 2009;Lafreni\u00e8re et al. 2009). Additionally, non-equilibrium CO/CH 4 chemistry in the atmospheres of HR 8799 c and d has been suggested by Hinz et al. (2010) based on mid-infrared (3.3 \u03bcm, Lband, and M-band) photometry. Likewise, Janson et al. (2010) presented a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) 3.88-4.10 \u03bcm spectrum of HR 8799 c and suggested that the disagreement with atmospheric models based on chemical equilibrium may hint at the influence of non-equilibrium chemistry.\n\nMethane forms at temperatures 1400 K (e.g., Fortney et al. 2008), so under equilibrium conditions",

            "text": "The Earth is unique in our Solar System. It is the only planet with plate tectonics and liquid water on the surface. It is not known, however, the extent to which the Earth is unique among all terrestrial planets beyond our Solar System. The Kepler mission's discoveries establish that Earth-sized planets are common in the Galaxy, with as many as 11% of Sun-like stars hosting planets 1-2 times the radius of the Earth and receiving comparable solar flux (Marcy et al. 2014;Fulton et al. 2017). Together with other discovery campaigns, we know now of many exoplanets with masses and radii consistent with being terrestrial, rock/metal-dominated planets, rather than gas-dominated. The degree to which these planets can maintain surface oceans, plate tectonics or even be considered \"Earth-like\" is not known and is a complex function of the planet's composition, formation, and dynamical state (e.g. Foley 2015;Foley & Driscoll 2016). We assert that for a planet to be \"Earth-like\" and habitable, it must be habitable in the same manner as the Earth. At a minimum this means the planet must sustain surface liquid water for millions to billions of years. . Because stable liquid water exists in a relatively narrow range in temperatures and pressures, the planet must have a process to regulate atmospheric temperatures. On the Earth, moderate temperatures are maintained by the incoming solar radiation combined with moderate greenhouse warming from CO 2 , H 2 O, and CH 4 . Therefore, supply and regulation of these gases is key to Earth's, and thus \"Earth-like\" planet's climate. This definition is in contrast to the typical one for \"Earth-like,\" in which a planet is defined simply as one with a bulk density characteristic of being roughly that of a mixture of metal \u00b1 rock. \n\nThe Earth's atmospheric regulatory processes and aqueous chemistry arise from tectonics: the recycling of material between a planet's surface and mantle. For Earth, the recycling process manifests as special case of tectonics, plate tectonics, in which oceanic crust continuously subducts into the interior and convective upwellings returning some material to the surface.",

A wealth of data, collected over many decades through observations, space missions, and field and laboratory studies, have been used to formulate our ever-evolving theories of how Earth, the other planets, and their satellites formed and how the system has dynamically evolved towards its current state.\n\nIn the context of astrobiology, understanding the origin of water and other materials essential for life, on Earth and on other, possibly habitable environments in the Solar System, is of profound importance. The chemical composition of the first planetesimals-the building blocks of planets-and how they evolved as a function of distance from the Sun can be inferred by studying collected extraterrestrial materials and by analyzing remote sensing data of comets and asteroids. New amazing results from the ESA Rosetta space mission demonstrate the presence of organic material on the nucleus of the Jupiter-family comet 67P/Churiumov-Gerasimenko, probably formed by the interaction of ices (H 2 O, CO 2 , CO) with solar radiation (Capaccioni et al., 2015). The measured D/H ratio of the comet 67P was found to be larger than that previously measured in comets, and this finding opens up new questions about the formation mechanisms of comets and the chemical models of the protoplanetary solar nebula (Altwegg et al., 2015). Models are necessary to explain the present Solar System architecture. These models are continuously refined by feedback both from observations of our own and other planetary systems and from laboratory simulation experiments. Nevertheless, many gaps remain. These observations should involve protoplanetary discs for which the only known species are CO, CN, HCN, or HCO + , and future observations are needed to build up more robust chemistry models (Beuther et al., 2014, and references therein;Dutrey et al., 2014).\n\nSince the observation of the first exoplanet orbiting a Sunlike star (Mayor and Queloz, 1995), astrophysicists have realized that planet formation should include orbit migration involving chaotic phases in planetary systems, which makes it difficult to reconstruct the initial configuration of the protoplanets.\n\nStars and planets are the end products of",

The present study has also the merit to fix the conditions to be satisfied by a planet belonging to the Solar System. This point is extremely important as it is obvious that the Solar System cannot contain infinite celestial objects. On the other hand, the similarities shown in this paper through Table  1 between atomic configurations and the Solar System indicate that our atomic model of the Solar System may play an important role in the implementation of the quantum theory of freedmons.

            "text": "With the rapid pace at which exoplanets are being discovered, many efforts have now been dedicated to identifying which planets are expected to have the ingredients necessary for the development of life. In this work we explore the relative disposition of the essential elements carbon and nitrogen in each stage of star and planet formation, using the Earth and our solar system as grounding data. Our results suggest that planets like the Earth are readily supplied with these key elements, but their relative amounts on the surface and in the atmosphere will be highly variable.\n\nii) Owing to low levels of observed nitrogen, particularly in ices (e.g., N 2 ), comets have elevated C/N ratios compared with the Sun (15). Based on the relative disposition of C and N in the ISM this can be partially achieved as comets accrete ISM carbonaceous dust with low nitrogen content. In this light, Halley is inferred to have more N in solid dust than its gaseous coma (15), which is also higher than estimates for interstellar dust (Fig. 2). There is also a sharp difference in the absolute C and N content of Halley compared with the Sungrazing comets, which have chondritic abundances. However, their C/N ratios are comparable. Anhydrous interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), which are argued to be of cometary origin (16), are also characterized by a high carbon content, (C/Si) IDP \u223c 2 (17). iii) Carbonaceous, enstatite, and ordinary chondrites have elevated C/N ratios compared with both the Sun and comets. All meteorites are carbon poor compared with the Sun, ISM dust, and comet Halley, but the key distinction is owing to comparative nitrogen depletion in chondrites. Among meteorites, carbonaceous and enstatite chondrites have similar ratios, but ordinary chondrites have higher and more variable C/N, with mean values closer to those of the bulk silicate Earth. iv) For the Earth, both the surface reservoir and bulk silicate\n\nEarth have elevated C/N ratios compared with the Sun. The surface reservoir is comparable to chondritic, owing to preferential volcanic degassing of N 2 , leading to the N-rich atmosphere",

            "text": "timing and duration of transits can yield both a mass and radius for the moon [41]. Coupled with the mass and radius of the host planet, one can begin to deduce basic information about how the moon may have formed. The effect of an exomoon (or moons) on the behavior of a transiting planet is strongly dependent on the satellite-to-planet mass ratio [41][42][43][44], so systems with a single large satellite are the most likely to be found.\n\nThe Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler (HEK) team reports that their survey can plausibly detect a planetary moon 0.1 Earth masses, or roughly the mass of Mars. This is about ten times larger than the largest planetary satellites in our Solar System. At present, it is not clear how moons of this size may form [33], or how common they might be. This is because very little is known about how the satellite formation processes proposed for our Solar System might scale to different planetary masses and stellar conditions.\n\nHere, I discuss the present state of knowledge of satellite formation in our Solar System, and prospects for extrapolating these theories to predict satellite sizes in exoplanetary systems. In Section 2, I discuss the classes of satellites observed in our Solar System. Formation of satellites around rocky and icy planets is described in Section 3. Gas giant satellite formation is discussed in Section 4. Satellite formation methods proposed for planetary satellites which have been ruled out because they do not match one or more Solar System observations are discussed in Section 5. Exomoon detection methods are summarized in Section 7. The paper concludes with a discussion about the possibilities for, and limitations of extrapolating Solar System theories to other systems, and avenues for future work. Table 1 lists the largest satellites of each of the planets in our Solar System, including the satellites of the dwarf planet Pluto. Any object executing a prograde orbit that is roughly co-planar with the equator of a larger planetary body is considered to be a regular satellite. Thus, Earth's Moon, Phobos and Deimos at Mars, the satellites of Pluto, and the large moons of the outer planets are considered to be regular satellites. The semi-major axes of the major regular satellites range from a few to a few tens of planetary radii, indicating that the",

            "text": "Uranus, the seventh planet in the solar system and the first planet to be \"discovered\" by telescopic observation, is an oddity in multiple senses. From its unique magnetospheric configuration to its quiescent atmosphere and heating imbalance to its dense and narrow rings and incredibly dark and tectonized icy satellites, the Uranian system hosts a range of outstanding and compelling mysteries of interest to disciplines across space science. The only in-situ observations of the Uranian magnetosphere to-date are from the 1986 Voyager 2 flyby (e.g., Stone and Miner 1986), which have left us with several outstanding mysteries regarding its magnetospheric dynamics (e.g., Kollmann et al. 2020;Paty et al. 2020). As such, the study of the Uranian magnetosphere is a crucial step for testing the limits of our understanding of magnetospheric dynamics; this is especially important as the community uses its collective knowledge of planets to guide the understanding of even more exotic regimes like exoplanets and brown dwarf stars (e.g., Schrijver 2009;Nichols et al. 2012;Kislyakova et al. 2014;Hallinan et al. 2015). \n\nUranus, and its sister Ice Giant, Neptune, remain the only two planets in the solar system that have yet to be thoroughly explored by an orbiting mission.

            "text": "Over the past two decades, many observations have unveiled an abnormal structure of distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), which cannot be explained by the known eight-planet solar system alone [1,2]. While a new ninth planet in our Solar System could account for this dynamical phenomenon [3,4]. Planet Nine (P9) is predicted with a mass of \u223c5-10 M \u2295 , semi-major axis of a 9 \u223c400-800 AU and eccentricity between e 9 \u223c0.2-0.5 [4]. The probability of P9 has been discussed for scattering the planet from a smaller orbit, ejecting it from the solar system or capturing it from another system as a free-floating planet [4][5][6]. It would indicate that the current theories for forming planets need to be updated. Further studies have also been carried out for the possible magnitudes [7], the mass and radius [8] of the P9. \n\nConsidering the absence of an apparent optical counterpart by now, the authors in Ref. [9] discussed the possibility of a primordial black hole (BH) as the P9. It aims to explain two anomalies: the orbits of TNOs and the microlensing events in the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) with an object mass of M\u223c0.5-20 M \u2295 [10,11]. However, the primordial BH is not the only dark component in the mass range of approximately M \u2295 beyond the standard models [12][13][14][15][16]. Other hybrid objects were also discussed by several groups. For example, in Ref. [17,18], the authors proposed the possibility of small neutron stars which consist of a small compact matter core in a dark matter halo. However, considering the minimum mass of neutron stars \u223c0.1 M [19] is higher than the mass of P9, it is out of consideration here. \n\nHere, we discuss the possibility of a mirror planet act-ing as the P9 which is formed by mirror dark matter, another possible dark matter candidate. In this scenario, the mirror sector is the exact copy of the standard model sector to keep the full Poincar\u00e9 symmetry [14].",

Here, we take the starting configurations to be circular orbits with a range of semimajor axes a 0 = 200-800 au. The final system parameters that represent successful production require orbital eccentricity 0.4 < e f < 0.9, semimajor axis a f = 400-1500 au, and inclination angle i f < 60\u00b0 (Batygin & Brown 2016). Figure 2 shows the scattering optical depths for producing Planet Nine as a function of the starting semimajor axis. The formation probabilities are low unless the starting semimajor axis is large, a 0 \uf089 400 au, comparable to the required final values of a 9 . Even for a 0 = 600 au, the preferred final value, the probability of scattering Planet Nine into its required orbit is only \u223c25%. The probabilities fall to \u223c3% for a 0 = 200 au. Planets starting with orbits in the giant-planet region of our solar system have a negligible chance of scattering into the required orbit. This finding is consistent with previous results (Adams & Laughlin 2001;Li & Adams 2015), which show that eccentricity and inclination angles are much more readily altered than semimajor axes during scattering interactions.\n\nNext, we consider the probability of removing Planet Nine from its orbit. Here, we consider a range of initial orbital elements, with semimajor axis a 9 = 400-1000 au and eccentricity e 9 = 0.4-0.8. These ejection simulations are carried out for both the solar birth cluster (v b = 1 km s \u22121 ) and the solar neighborhood (v b = 40 km s \u22121 ). Figure 3 shows the resulting optical depths for ejecting Planet Nine from our solar system, plotted versus initial semimajor axis a 9 . The scattering optical depths are of order unity for the cluster environment (solid curves) but are lower, 0.003-0.03, for the field (dashed curves). Moreover, the interaction rates increase with orbital eccentricity. These results suggest that lower eccentricities and late formation times are preferred.\n\nNext,",

Some evidence pointing on its possible mass in 10 Earth\u2019s mass; its distance from Sun at perihelion can be ~200AU, at aphelion 600-1200AU, and orbital period about 15000 years. Authors suggest that in early SS about 4.5 billion years ago, planet has been pushed out of the field of planets formation near the Sun. But all these conclusions are based on computer calculations of orbits of several known trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), including Sedna, 2004VN112, 2012VP113, 2010GB174, 2007TG422, 2013RF98. We draw attention to the fact that these 6 TNOs found at perihelion, when their brilliance for terrestrial observers be maximal, and orbital speed was greatest. But just only after 50-100 years, they depart from this convenient location in space to open them. And then for thousands years, these objects will move in remote parts of their orbits. Our estimates show that the actual number of TNO with the same orbits as 6 taken into account in calculations objects should be several orders of magnitude greater. But for the moment they are invisible for terrestrial observer, because they are very far from perihelion point. Therefore, on the basis of purely probabilistic assumptions, it should be very large number of TNOs with very eccentric orbits. Then real results of calculation for the entire ensemble of existing remote objects is strikingly different from the primary. And therefore problem of ninth planet is still on the agenda. Most likely, it is necessary to raise the question of finding the many thousands of TNOs on highly elongated orbits, and very far from terrestrial observer.",

The structure contains clues of the past giant planet migrations (as suggested by the NICE and Grand Tack models) and reveals the current influence of the giant planets (Jupiter's role in the structure of the asteroid belt and Neptune's role in that of the Kuiper belt). Any debris system with similar structures may be signaling the presence of planets. One of the best examples is the HR 8799 system. From the marginally resolved images and detailed SED modeling, two major dust components are inferred: cold Kuiper-belt and warm asteroid-belt analogs (Su et al. 2009). The four directly imaged massive planets lie between them, as expected if orbital resonances maintain the debris disk structure. Resonance structures are not limited to massive planets -our terrestrial planets are known to create asymmetric features in the circumsolar ring (Reach et al. 2010, Stenborg et al. 2018). Resolved debris images provide constraints on unseen planets through their interactions with the disks (details see reviews by Wyatt 2008 andHughes et al. 2018), which manifest as variations in debris width and eccentricity, creating offsets and asymmetries in debris belts. By resolving the structure of debris disks around stars of different ages, we would learn the planetary configurations at different times. Doing so with a large sample, we can explore the full evolution of planetary systems and determine whether our Solar System's architecture (terrestrial planets, asteroid belt, giant planets and ice giants and Kuiper belt, right panel of Fig. 1) is unique or not, putting our Solar System into context. \n\nBecause the debris is mostly generated by collisional cascades of planetesimals, a wide range of particle sizes is present in debris belts, with a typical power-law size distribution. Depending on its stellocentric distance, the emission of the debris peaks at different wavelengths: \u223c25 \u00b5m for the warm asteroid-like belts and \u223c60 \u00b5m for the cold Kuiper-belt analogs.",

            "text": "For example, there were some suggestions that the nearresonant gravitational interactions between giant outer planets and smaller inner planets can shape the configuration of an inner system's asteroid belt (e.g., Williams & Faulkner 1981;Minton & Malhotra 2011). Hence, it was suggested that our solar system's inner planets are of a second generation, which came after Jupiter migrated inward to its current orbit (e.g., Batygin & Laughlin 2015). Furthermore, secular resonance pdenham629@gmail.com snaoz@astro.ucla.edu may be the cause of water being delivered to earth (Scholl & Froeschle 1986;Morbidelli 1994), the potential instability of Mercury's orbit (Neron de Surgy & Laskar 1997;Fienga et al. 2009;Batygin & Laughlin 2008;Lithwick & Wu 2011), and the obliquity of the exoplanets' in general (e.g., Naoz et al. 2011;Li et al. 2014b). \n\nRecently, several studies showed that the presence of a giant planet can affect the ability to detect an inner system (e.g., Hansen 2017;Becker & Adams 2017;Mustill et al. 2017;Jontof-Hutter et al. 2017;Huang et al. 2017). Specifically, dynamical interactions from a giant planet, having a semi-major axis much greater than the planets in the inner system, can excite eccentricities and inclinations of the inner planets. A possible effect is that the inner system becomes incapable of having multiple transits or completely unstable. Volk & Gladman (2015) showed that observed multi-planet systems may actually be the remnants of a compact system that was tighter in the past but lost planets through dynamical instabilities and collisions (see also Petrovich et al. 2014). Interestingly, verifying these problems could reconcile the Kepler dichotomy (e.g., Johansen et al. 2012;Ballard & Johnson 2016;Hansen 2017). \n\nIn this work, we investigate the stability of compact sub-Jovian inner planetary systems in the presence of a distant giant planet (see Figure 2 for an illustration of the system).",

            "text": "Short of full numerical simulations that track the Uranian node, significant physical intuition can be gained from the linear approximation provided by Laplace-Lagrange secular theory. Secular theory describes the orbital motion of planetary orbits as an averaged approximation of their long term motions. Terms in the gravitational disturbing function that include the mean longitude are ignored in this approximation, as they vary relatively rapidly and in the long term average to zero. In the late 1700s, it was determined that to lowest order, the time dependence of the eccentricities e (Laplace 1775) and the inclinations I (Lagrange 1778) of a planetary system with k bodies are described by a system of first-order linear differential equations \n\nWhich was applied to the motion of the solar system planets by Laplace (1784) (for an in-depth review of the development of Laplace-Lagrange secular theory, see (Laskar 2013)). Here z \u2261 e exp \u221a \u22121 and \n\nwhere the quantities \u03b4 j , \u03b1 ij , \u03b3 j , \u03b2 ij are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the A k and B k matrices, respectively. The i and j indices range from 1 to k and represent each planet in the system. Of particular interest to our analysis is the quantity \u03b4 j , which determines the \"forcing frequency\" at which the jth body perturbs \u2126. \n\nA slightly modified version of the foregoing theory that is specific to the Solar System (and which partially accounts for additional Jupiter-Saturn interactions) was developed by Brouwer & van Woerkom (1950), and was notably reprinted in (Murray & Dermott 2000). \n\nGiven the time evolution of z i and \u03b6 i , the orbital elements (see Equation 11) including \u2126 can be recovered. Figure 5 shows the inclination evolution of the four outer planets implied by secular theory, as well as the evolution of the Uranian g. Planet Nine is a hypothesized body in the outer Solar System whose existence has been inferred from the apparent apsidal confinement of long-period trans-Neptunian objects (Batygin & Brown 2016). For a more detailed review of the evidence for Planet Nine, see (Batygin et al. 2019).",

After introducing the three dwarf planets Eris, Haumea, and Makemake, we find that system III has a significant increase in \u2206i m up to 1263 mas, as shown in Table 4. Such an i m difference is two orders of magnitude larger than that for system II including only PCPV in Souami & Souchay (2012). Thus we propose that these three big bodies must be taken into account to determine the invariable plane. Indeed, the contributions from minor planets to the variation of the invariable plane are linearly addible, that is, we have \n\nwhere the number in parentheses refers to the n-th sample. Then more specifically, the i m difference caused by the inclusion of Eris, Haumea, and Makemake is \u2206 (EHM) i m \u223c 1254 mas. It is important to point out that the quantified effect of certain minor planet(s) on the invariable plane, for example, \u2206 (EHM) i m , is independent from any other additional contributions to the solar system's angular momentum. Finally, we evaluate the inclinations i m of the invariable plane for the even more complete systems IV, V, and VI, which include the 279 minor planet samples with measured masses, the 135325 samples with measured masses or diameters, and all the 718041 nominal samples, respectively. Although these systems may have uncertainties in the angular momenta of the faint minor planets, the results show that the i m differences with respect to the basic system I are always greater than 1000 mas, that is, over 100 times larger than that for system II. According to Eq. (9), besides system III samples, the additional i m contribution from the rest of the minor planets in the solar system could be around \u2206 (rest) i m = \u2212220 mas.",

            "text": "Several papers have recently suggested the possible presence of a ninth planet (Planet X) that might explain the gravitational perturbations of a number of detached Trans-Neptunian objects. To analyze the possibility further, we have applied celestial mechanics, engineering physics and statistical analysis to develop improved estimates of the planet's primary orbital elements and mass from first engineering principles, using the orbital characteristics of both the original group of 6 objects analyzed and also a second group comprising the original 6 together with 6 additional long-period asteroids selected by the authors. We show that the driving force behind the observed clustering is gravitational torque that arranges the orbits of asteroids in a systematic, orderly manner, and we develop the associated equations of motion. As evidence we show that the expected effects are fully apparent in the orbital characteristics of the correlated bodies involved, including most strikingly regarding their orbital planes, azimuth orientations and specific relative angular momenta, which we show generates a highly unexpected form of resonance in their relative angular momenta. We further show that the coordinates of Planet 9's orbit are close to the original values proposed recently by other authors, although we prove that its period has to be dramatically smaller than that proposed in recent literature by Batygin and Brown, 2019, at about 3500 yrs, the eccentricity is near 0.65, and its mass approximately 8.4 times the Earth's mass. Given the predicted orbit we show that the planet has apparently created numerous mean motion resonances, of which seven are noted specifically. As for a possible observation, Planet X, would range between V=18.9 and 26.1, probably with a magnitude of about 24.8.",

            "text": "The primary condensate mineralogy of several of our model systems is essentially identical to that of the Solar System. For example, HD72659 is very similar to the Solar System, both in terms of its bulk mineralogy and its general chemical structure (such as the pronounced appearance of the water ice line at 140K). Combination of the condensate mineralogy with the dynamical simulations shows that terrestrial planets in HD72659 have compositions similar to those in our own Solar System. Enrichments occur in the planetary abundances of the most volatile species (Na and S). This enrichment is likely an artifact of the fact that we do not consider volatile loss during accretion in the current simulations, which is expected to be significant. Thus, we can expect that terrestrial planets present within these systems have compositions broadly similar to those within our own Solar System. Therefore, systems with elemental abundances and ratios similar to these are ideal places to focus future \"Earth-like\" planet searches. \n\nProfound mineralogical variations occur in systems with C/O values above approximately 0.8. The inner part of these systems are dominated by refractory carbon species such as graphite, SiC and TiC. Outside of this zone, the mineralogy largely resembles that of the Solar System. The presence of this narrow carbon zone results in Earth-like terrestrial bodies enriched in C (up to 0.68wt%). The Gl777A system has Mg/Si and C/O values that are close to the mean values of known extrasolar planetary systems (1.32 and 0.78 respectively). This result implies that the \"average\" extrasolar planetary system is made of solid material with compositions comparable to that of our own Solar System with minor C enrichment. \n\nIt is the systems with the highest C/O values that produce the most unusual planets. For example, HD108874 has a C/O value of 1.35. In this system, refractory species are composed of C, SiC and TiC, as opposed to the Ca and Al-rich inclusions characteristic of the earliest solids from our Solar System. Solid carbon is stable inside of 1.4 AU, causing close-in terrestrial planets to be dominated by carbon-bearing solids.",

            "text": "Lying at the edge of the visible solar system, observational confirmation of the existence of the Kuiper belt came approximately a quarter-century ago with the discovery of the distant minor planet (15760) Albion (formerly 1992 QB1, Jewitt and Luu 1993). With the clarity of hindsight, we now recognize that Pluto was the first discovered member of the Kuiper belt. The current census of the Kuiper belt includes more than 2000 minor planets at heliocentric distances between ~ 30 and ~ 50 au. Their orbital distribution reveals a rich dynamical structure shaped by the gravitational perturbations of the giant planets, particularly Neptune.\n\nTheoretical analysis of these structures has revealed a remarkable dynamic history of the solar system. The story is as follows (see Ip 1984, 1996;Malhotra 1993Malhotra , 1995, and many subsequent works). Some ~ 4 gigayears ago, the orbits of the giant planets-Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune-were more compact and the solar system contained a lot more planetary debris in the form of asteroids and comets. That debris was gradually cleared by the collective gravitational perturbations of the planets, but this process had a back-reaction on the planets: it caused a spreading out and re-arrangement of the giant planets' orbits and eventually led to a more stable solar system that we enjoy now.\n\nDuring that epoch of planet migration, the populations of minor planets were decimated. The small fraction that survived in proximity to their formation locations are predominantly beyond Neptune. An early specific theoretical prediction was that the minor planets beyond Neptune that survived the planet migration epoch should be found piled up in eccentric orbits in mean motion resonances (MMRs) with Neptune, particularly the 3/2 and the 2/1 MMRs (Malhotra 1995). The subsequent discoveries of dozens of \"Plutinos\" in the 3/2 MMR has been interpreted as proof of the theory and has led to the widespread acceptance of the idea of giant planet migration as a core part of the early history of the solar system.\n\nThe migration of the giant planets has implications for a broad range of planetary science, including our understanding of planet formation, the origin of the solar system architecture, dynamical evolution of the solar system, the provenance of the various minor planet groupings, the transport of planetesima",

            "text": "al state of large semimajor axis centaurs, which constitutes the third major line of evidence for the existence of Planet Nine.\n\nThere exist two other secondary lines of evidence for the existence of Planet Nine, which we did not discuss in this paper. The first is the obliquity of the Sun (Bailey et al. 2016;Lai 2016;Gomes et al. 2017). One reason we chose to not discuss this dynamical effect is because it is intrinsically trivial. It is well-known that secular coupling between two mutually inclined orbits results in a regression of the node of both orbits, meaning that the twisting of the giant planets' orbital plane out of alignment with the solar spin axis is an inescapable consequence of Planet Nine's existence. As a result, the genuinely remarkable aspect of this calculation is not that a spin-orbit misalignment can be excited, but the fact that a Planet Nine configuration close to the one deduced from distant Kuiper Belt constraints can adequately reproduce the solar obliquity when its gravitational influence is exerted over the entire lifetime of the solar system.\n\nAt the same time, we note that strictly speaking, Planet Nine is not required to explain the obliquity of the Sun, and other theoretical models exist. For example, Batygin (2012) argued that a primordial binary companion to the solar system could have excited the observed spin-orbit misalignment through the same exact mechanism, while Lai et al. (2011) proposed that magnetic interactions between the Sun and the inner regions of the protosolar nebula could have accomplished the same task. We note, however, that while a multitude of processes could have contributed to the observed obliquity of the Sun, the gravitational influence of Planet Nine provides the only dynamical mechanism that is directly testable. 15 In our coplanar calculations, this transition also corresponds to the progressive dominance of the angle res y over res f (see Equation (4)) as the resonant guiding center.\n\nAnother population of objects that Planet Nine naturally generates is the highly inclined component of the proximate (a 100 au < ) Kuiper Belt. This subset of bodies includes all objects with i 35 deg \uf089 that do not naturally emerge from simulations of the solar system's primordial evolution (Levison et",

These 99 systems represent \u223c31.5 per cent of all the planetary systems found, as shown in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows a qualitative comparison between some examples of observed solar systems, which are shown in the first column and where only the giant planets are plotted, and some generated with our simulations, shown in the second column. In the figure, the semi-major axes of the planets are indicated on the x-axis, while their mass is represented with the different sizes of the black circles drawn above each planet. As shown in the figure, the observational sample of solar systems can be reproduced qualitatively by our simulations.\n\nIn the figure, the artificial solar system shown in the first row was formed considering \u03b3 = 1 and c migI = 0.1. In the second row, the solar system was generated assuming \u03b3 = 0.5 and c migI = 0.1. As shown in both cases, a flat disc is needed, in order to form these systems. This is because a small value of \u03b3 favours the formation of several giant planets farther from the central star. If a solar system was born from a disc with a great accumulation in the inner disc, as is the case when \u03b3 = 1.5, which is also similar to the case of the MMSN model of Hayashi (1981), a very slow or zero migration is required in order for the giant planets formed in the ice line to stay there and not become hot Jupiters. That is precisely what is observed in the artificial system formed in the third row, which was generated assuming a disc profile characterized by \u03b3 = 1.5 and where the planetary migration was not considered. Finally, the planetary system formed in the fourth row was born in a disc characterized by \u03b3 = 1 and where the embryos do not migrate, which is consistent with the preferred scenario for the formation of these systems.\n\nWe cannot ignore our own Solar system, so a qualitative comparison of our planetary system with a generated one is shown in Fig. 4. The distance between the planets and their central star is shown on the x-axis and their mass is shown with the dark circles of different size, given for each planet.\n\nIn the figure, only Jupiter and Saturn are shown, because",

The task is to parse out the formation pathways that lead to the fully formed planets. \n\nBefore the advent of exoplanets, planet formation theories only needed to explain the solar system, characterized by the dichotomy of rocky planets in the inner solar system and gaseous and icy giants in the outer portion, with two debris belts at medium and large semi-major axis. Thanks to exoplanets and circumstellar disk observations, we now know those initial theories were highly biased. However, many aspects of solar system formation remain gold standards owing to the wealth of data available, including mass, radius, bulk chemical and isotopic compositions from studying the different solar system planets, meteorites, comets, asteroids and Kuiper belt objects, compared to that of exo-systems, for which we will never have such detailed cosmochemical information. Thus, our summary will focus on the lessons learned from the solar system formation, and we will describe connections made to extrasolar systems in both theory and observations. It will become apparent that generalizing from the solar system is not straight forward, given the numerous complex processes that happen during formation and the vast parameter space that has been poorly sampled with only 30 years of exoplanet discoveries.",

These are shown with respect to the single Jovian planet population in Figure 8b, and schematically in Figure 9. There are several ways in which a Solar system analogue can be defined. \n\nEridani (Sch\u00fctz et al. 2004;Backman et al. 2009;Greaves et al. 2014;Lestrade & Thilliez 2015;MacGregor et al. 2015;Su et al. 2017) and HR 8799 (Marois et al. 2008;Rhee et al. 2007;Su et al. 2009;Marois et al. 2010;Matthews et al. 2014;Contro et al. 2016) are two such examples, both having multiple asteroid belts and hosting (or are proposed to host) several giant planets, just as we find in the Solar system. However, none have thus far been found to host rocky planets in their HZs. Another example is the recent discovery of the eighth planet in the Kepler-90 system (Shallue & Vanderburg 2017), just as we find 8 planets in our own system. However, these planets are all on far smaller, tighter orbits than planets in our Solar system. For this work, we use the term Solar system analogue to encompass those systems that have a rocky Earth-like planet in the HZ, and a Jovian planet beyond the HZ with orbital periods similar to the Earth and Jupiter respectively. Given that we use massless TPs in our simulations, we cannot constrain the stable semi-major axes of the HZ, as gravitational interactions between any putative exo-Earth and the Jovian planet are not taken into account. Thus we seek only those systems with a Jovian planet beyond the HZ that also have an entirely, or predominantly, unperturbed HZ. Figure 9 shows the 20 systems found in this study that fit this definition, with our Solar system (Earth and Jupiter only) for comparison. \n\nFollowing Agnew et al. (2017), we can compute the magnitude of the Doppler wobble that a 1 M \u2295 planet would induce on its host star using the equation",

            "text": "Big Question #2: What is the origin, evolution, and structure of planetary systems? In a prevailing hypothesis of solar system origin and evolution, the outer planets played a pivotal role in molding our solar system in a complex process that included orbital migration of the giant planets, scattering of planetesimals into the inner solar system, and the delivery of water and other materials that are essential to life to the terrestrial planets. In addition, studies of the ice giants (Uranus and Neptune) have revealed limitations in our understanding of basic planetary formation processes. Models predict that ice giants should be rare, yet exoplanet surveys find that they are abundant. \n\nStudying the composition and internal structure of all the giant planets provide insights into how, when, and where they formed. Critical measurements (e.g., noble gases and isotopic ratios) require in-situ measurements by an atmospheric entry probe. While the Jupiter and Saturn systems have had dedicated orbiter missions (e.g. Galileo, Juno, Cassini), and an atmospheric probe has been sent into Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune have never had an orbiter mission. Given the importance of dedicated orbiter missions in understanding the origins of our solar system, exploration of ice giants was a top recommendation in the previous Decadal Survey (Vision and Voyages, 2011). While both Uranus and Neptune systems are compelling scientific targets, critical differences exist between them. \n\nUltimately, both must be explored if we are to understand ice giants as a class of planet. However, because Triton has been identified as a higher-priority Ocean Worlds target than any Uranian satellite, OPAG favors a Neptune mission first. \n\nBig Question #3: What present-day processes shape planetary systems, and how do these processes create diverse outcomes within and across different worlds? The tremendous diversity of bodies in the outer solar system provides the opportunity for a wide variety of scientific investigations. The satellites of the giant planets, some comparable in size to terrestrial planets, and the dwarf planets of the Kuiper Belt (\"KBO planets\" hereafter) offer opportunities to study extreme environments on worlds that have experienced very different histories. Tidal heating of satellites leads to current activity and conditions potentially favorable to habitability.",

            "text": "A recent influx of planets discovered orbiting other stars has shed light upon the solar system's peculiarities. Specifically, a hallmark of many extrasolar planetary systems is their proximity to the host star. Commonly, planets larger than Earth occupy orbits significantly closer in than Mercury, contrasting sharply with the emptiness of our own inner solar system (Chiang & Laughlin 2013;Coughlin et al. 2016).\n\nAn important clue to this puzzling disparity is that close-in \"super-Earths\" around other stars often possess extensive atmospheres, and thus necessarily formed before the dissipation of their natal gas disks; this occurs within about 3 Myr (Haisch et al. 2001). In contrast, isotopic evidence reveals that the Earth formed in roughly \u223c30-50 Myr (Kleine et al. 2009;Yu & Jacobsen 2011). Somehow, terrestrial planet formation in our solar system was inhibited while the gas persisted, requiring a slower, gas-free mode of planet formation to assemble the innermost three planets (Morbidelli et al. 2012).\n\nA widely cited history of our solar system holds that Jupiter underwent gas-driven inward migration to around 1.5 au, before subsequently migrating outward due to interactions with Saturn (Hansen 2009;Walsh et al. 2011). This scenario has been augmented by the suggestion that Jupiter's trek swept up primordial planetesimals or planets into mean motion resonances, exciting their eccentricities and causing destructive collisions (Batygin & Laughlin 2015). Accordingly, our solar system's lack of extensive planet formation interior to \u223c1 au, prior to disk dispersal, emerges as a consequence of Jupiter's influence.\n\nJupiter's migration addresses the absence of super-Earths in the inner solar system, but does not explain the lack of subsequent planet formation interior to \u223c0.3 au. Jupiter would have initiated a collisional cascade, resulting in \u223c20 Earth masses of debris, occupying size classes \uf088100 km (Batygin & Laughlin 2015), with significant mass occupying 100 m and smaller. Such objects aerodynamically lose angular momentum when embedded in a gas disk (Weidenschilling 1977); however, the gas only extended to roughly 0.05-0.1 au from the Sun's surface (Armitage 2011), suggesting that aerodynamic drag cannot entirely remove",

These three sources can be distinguished by their deuterium to hydrogen ratio, which is well measured for the Earth's oceans and is known to be quite distinct for asteroids, Jupiterfamily and long-period comets. However, these measurements are quite challenging, and there have been only a handful of objects in each population for which this measurement has been made. The results are currently ambiguous, and it is not clear whether asteroids, Jupiter-family, or long-period comets contributed the bulk of the water on the Earth. Different models for the formation and evolution of the solar system, which are now much better constrained by a more complete census of the constituents and properties of our solar system, make different predictions for which of these three primary reservoirs the majority of our water was delivered (e.g., Nesvorny et al. 2010). Furthermore, by comparing the architecture of our own solar system to that of nearby planetary systems obtained by the deep direct imaging survey, it will be possible to piece together the ingredients that are required to build not just our own inhabited planet, but potentially habitable planets in general.",

Using equations ( 3) and ( 6) of Faber & Quillen (2007), we estimate that the cavity between \u223c 10 au and \u223c 80 au could be populated by 4-5 planets of at least Neptune mass, with a semimajor axis ratio between neighbouring planets of \u223c 1.6 (i.e., similar to the orbital radius ratio of Earth and Mars in the Solar System). The minimum total mass of these planets would amount to \u223c 0.2 Jupiter masses. \n\nThere are currently two planetary systems known to have an architecture similar to the one proposed for q 1 Eri. One is our own Solar System. Another is a prominent system around HR 8799, with its four directly imaged massive planets (Marois et al. 2008(Marois et al. , 2010)), an outer massive \"Kuiper belt\" exterior to and an inner debris belt interior to the planetary orbits (see, e.g., Reidemeister et al. 2009;Su et al. 2009). However, there are also fine differences between these cases. The q 1 Eri system is known to contain a close-in Jupiter-mass radial velocity planet whereas our Solar System harbours four terrestrial planets. Around HR 8799, no planets have been discovered so far inside the inner dusty belt. It is interesting to note that the known planet of q 1 Eri system is orbiting at \u223c 2 au, whereas the proposed inner belt must be located farther out, at 3 to 10 au. Thus, the belt was likely located outside the snow line when it formed which, assuming an ice sublimation temperature at the protoplanetary phase of 170 K (Lecar et al. 2006), must have been at \u223c 3.3 au from the star. This means that the planet could have comfortably formed in the zone interior to the \"asteroid belt\".",

These physical processes are ultimately imprinted on the architectures of ex-oplanetary systems, specifically, the distributions of masses, compositions, and orbits. 69,70 Measuring these distributions, i.e., determining the demographics of large samples of exoplanets, is our best opportunity to gain insight into the physical processes that drive planet formation.\n\nAfter nearly two decades of exoplanet discovery, our statistical census of exoplanets, as well as our understanding of planet formation and evolution, remains largely incomplete. This is because the currently confirmed exoplanets occupy a limited region of parameter space that is largely disjoint from both the planets in our solar system, and from the three largest reservoirs of planets that are predicted by many planet formation theories. 69,70 Kepler has begun the process of creating a complete statistical census of exoplanetary systems by assaying the population of one of these reservoirs, namely small \"hot\" and \"warm\" planets. 71,63 Kepler has been enormously successful, discovering thousands of candidate exoplanets in a bewildering array of architectures.

These measurements are compared to models for solar system formation and evolution in an iterative manner where new measurements improve models and models provide guidelines for future measurements that are needed.\n\nMeasurements of cometary composition provide constraints in two areas. First, cometary composition provides a tracer of chemical conditions during solar system formation. Comets are small bodies that formed from ices and dust in the protosolar nebula (PSN) and are presumed to have evolved very little since their initial formation. Their composition is representative of conditions in the region in which they formed. After formation, the orbits of many comets were perturbed by migration of the giant planets causing them to impact the planets and contribute to planetary volatile inventories. Our goal is to review current state of knowledge-including some early Rosetta mission results-on the role of comets in understanding the formation and evolution of other solar system bodies.\n\nIn Sect. 2 we outline the current understanding of the formation of the solar system and the relevant composition of the PSN. We then discuss what is known about the formation of the giant planets in Sect. 3 and their satellites in Sect. 4. The role of comets in producing the volatile inventories of the terrestrial planets is discussed in Sect. 5, and Pluto and Kuiper Belt objects are covered in Sect. 6. We summarize the current state of knowledge, what we expect to learn from future measurements and what future measurements are needed in Sect. 7.",

Past work has shown that hotter planets tend to have larger spectral features while cooler planets tend to have less prominent features due to hazes (Crossfield & Kreidberg 2017). This has been attributed to the fact that that at temperatures below \u223c1000K methane is abundant which can easily photolyze to produce carbon hazes which mute atmospheric features. Even if the atmosphere of G 9-40 is observed to be featureless, as noted by Kempton et al. (2018), the study of a large sample of sub-Neptune exoplanet atmospheres is especially important because these planets do not exist in our Solar System, and therefore no well-studied benchmark objects exist. Further, Kempton et al. (2018) argue that a large sample of sub-Neptune planets is needed for precise atmospheric characterization, to adequately study the high degree of diversity expected for their atmospheric compositions. 7. SUMMARY We validate the discovery of a sub-Neptune-sized R \u223c 2R \u2295 planet orbiting the nearby (d = 27.9 pc) high proper motion M2.5-dwarf G 9-40, discovered using photometric data from the K2 mission. G 9-40 is the second closest transiting planetary system discovered by the K2 mission to date. We validate the planetary origin of the K2 transits using ground-based AO imaging using the ShaneAO system on the Lick 3m Telescope, precision diffuser-assisted narrow-band (37nm wide filter centered at 857nm) transit photometry using the ARCTIC imager at the ARC 3.5m Telescope at APO, and using precision NIR radial velocities from the HPF",

            "text": "It is not particularly surprising that the HR 8799 planets do not have detectable short-period Jovian moons or binary-planet companions. Among the thousands of known exoplanets, there are still no securely detected exomoons or binary planets, even though companions of the mass and size of Jupiter should have been detectable around most Kepler target stars (Lewis et al. 2015). Nevertheless, our constraints ruling out massive edge-on exomoons and binary planets around HR 8799 are novel. Almost all published limits on the presence of exomoons (e.g., Kipping et al. 2014Kipping et al. , 2015 come from transiting exoplanet systems, which due to selection effects orbit close to their host stars (within 1-2 au). At these short orbital periods, the planets' Hill spheres are smaller, limiting the parameter space in which moons can survive. Indeed, only three of the hundreds of known moons in the solar system are found within 2 au of the Sun. So far, only Lazzoni et al. (2020) have published constraints on moons orbiting planets at similar orbital radii to the HR 8799 planets, and their direct imaging constraints only probe moons orbiting far from their host planets. Our constraints are first probes of moons and binary planets in a new parameter space (planet semimajor axis \uf08910 au and moon orbital period \uf08810 days).\n\nOne limitation of the radial velocity method of exomoon (and exoplanet) detection is that it is most sensitive to companions with close to edge-on orbital inclinations. The radial velocity signal induced by a companion is proportional to the sine of its orbital inclination, and generally it is not possible to measure a companion's true mass without an independent inclination measurement. It is therefore possible that massive exomoons or binary planets are hiding around the HR 8799 planets in nearly face-on orbits. The HR 8799 planets orbit their host star with orbital inclinations of about 20 degrees; if moons or binary planets in the system orbit in the same plane, their radial velocity signals would be attenuated by about a factor of 3. However, such massive moons and binary planets likely must have formed by dynamical capture, and would not necessarily orbit in the same plane as the planetary orbits.\n\nAnother promising",

            "text": "When compared to their exoplanet cousins, the solar system gas-and ice-giant planets provide accessible environments with the prospect of detailed measurements that would be infeasible in their exoplanet counterparts. Indeed, the solar system giants are in some respects, such as mass and bulk composition, the closest solar system analogs to the majority of the presently known exoplanets (see Fig. 1). For instance, the interior temperatures and pressures of the solar system's gas giants and hot Jupiters are broadly similar (e.g., Guillot 2005), as they are determined mainly by the mass and bulk composition (i.e., hydrogen and helium). Another way in which the solar system gas and ice giants are similar to many exoplanets is that the mean molecular weight of their atmospheres is generally believed to be lower than the available condensibles. The latter point is relevant because moist convection behaves differently in low mean molecular weight atmospheres (e.g., Li and Ingersoll 2015). \n\nThe majority of known exoplanets have been discovered by the transit survey method as exemplified by mission such as Kepler and TESS (Borucki 2016;Guerrero et al. 2021). Because the transit geometry is favored by small semi-major axis values, transiting exoplanets typically have higher equilibrium temperatures than planets in the Solar System. Although having higher equilibrium temperatures does not change the planetary bulk composition at the elemental level, it does impact the molecular composition of the planetary atmospheres (Lodders and Fegley 2002). Additionally, processes such as advection may also impact the atmospheric molecular composition (Fortney et al. 2020). While the molecular composition differences between planetary atmospheres are an important subject, our focus here is on the metallicity and not the chemical reservoirs for individual elements.",

            "text": "In many ways, the HR 8799 planetary system resembles our Solar system more closely than any other discovered to date \u2013 albeit significantly younger, and on a larger and more dramatic scale. The system features four giant planets and two debris belts. The first of these belts lies beyond the orbit of the outermost planet, and mirrors the location of our Solar system\u2019s Edgeworth-Kuiper belt. The second, which has yet to be fully observationally characterised, lies interior to the orbit of the innermost known planet, HR8799 e, and is an analogue to our Asteroid Belt. With such a similar architecture, the system is a valuable laboratory for examining exoplanetary dynamics, and the interaction between debris disks and giant planets. \n \nIn recent years, significant progress has been made in the characterisation of the outer of HR8799\u2019s debris disks, primarily using the Herschel Space Observatory. In contrast, the inner disk, which lies too close to its host star to be spatially resolved by that instrument, remains poorly understood. This, in turn, leaves significant questions over both the location of the planetesimals responsible for producing the observed dust, and the physical properties of those grains. \n \nWe have performed the most extensive simulations to date of the inner, unresolved debris belt around HR 8799, using UNSW Australia's supercomputing facility, Katana. In this work, we present the results of integrations following the evolution of a belt of dynamically hot debris interior to the innermost planet, HR8799 e, for a period of 60 million years, using an initial population of 500,000 massless test particles. These simulations have enabled the characterisation of the extent and structure of the inner belt, revealing that its outer edge must lie interior to the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with HR8799 e, at approximately 7.5 au, and highlighting the presence of fine structure analogous to the Solar system\u2019s Kirkwood gaps. In the future, our results will also allow us to calculate a first estimate of the small-body impact rate and water delivery prospects for any potential terrestrial planet(s) that might lurk, undetected, in the inner system.",

For the comparison simulations of the gas giants in our own solar system, the initial orbital parameters were determined from errors equal to the largest absolute errors in the t And planets. For most of the orbital parameters, planet d has the largest errors.\n\nAssuming the orbital times for Jupiter and planet d are the respective dynamical times, our solar system must be integrated for approximately 1.5 Myr. This duration corresponds to 280,000 Jupiter orbits, the same as planet d in 1 Myr. On this timescale 81% of outer solar system con\u00d0gurations are stable, which is statistically identical to t And. Every ejection occurred when Jupiter\u00cfs initial eccentricity was greater than 0.12 (more than ]1 standard deviation) and also followed the same inverse eccentricity-stability timescale trend. From these two observations, it appears that the eccentricity of the most massive planet in a planetary system determines stability. Of course, future observations may discredit this supposition. Our solar system is stable for at least 5 Gyr, yet only 81% of the simulations were stable. This reinforces earlier results that our solar system lies on the edge of chaos (Quinn 1998 ;Varadi, Ghil, & Kaula 1999) and also suggests that t And lies near this boundary. It is not correct to presume that these two results imply that t And is also stable for 5 Gyr, but it does demonstrate that stable con\u00d0gurations do exist in the parameter space allowed for this system.",

            "text": "The traditional view of our Solar System neatly divides it into the inner part, home of the terrestrial planets and rocky asteroids, and the outer region of the gas giants and icy small bodies. These are separated by the 'snow line', which marks the distance from the Sun where the ambient temperature allows icy bodies to form and survive. In this picture, the terrestrial planets formed 'dry', as only rocky material condensed from the solar nebula in the inner regions, while the outer planets became giants due to the fast formation of icy cores, followed by the run-away accretion of the abundant gas further from the young Sun. Earth's water was then delivered by occasional impacts of comets, whose eccentric orbits brought ice from their distant parent regions to the terrestrial planet region.\n\nDespite the pleasing simplicity of this model, there are a number of awkward problems: The samples of asteroids that we have on Earth, meteorites, show a variety of compositions, including aqueously altered minerals which must have formed in the presence of water, incompatible with asteroids being entirely dry rocks (e.g., Brearley and Jones, 1998). On the other hand, results from the Stardust mission showed that comet dust contains minerals formed at high temperature, presumably near to the Sun (Brownlee et al, 2006). Meanwhile, many extrasolar systems with gas giant planets close to their stars have been discovered, presenting a challenge to formation models (e.g., Mayor and Queloz, 1995;Winn and Fabrycky, 2015). Finally, recent observations have uncovered evidence of ice in unexpected places in the inner Solar System, including the population of 'Main-Belt Comets' (MBCs) which have stable asteroid-like orbits, inside the snow line, but which demonstrate comet-like activity (Hsieh and Jewitt, 2006).\n\nThe solution comes from the recognition that planetary systems are dynamic places, with the orbits of even the largest planets able to evolve and migrate, especially in the early period when interaction between forming planets and the proto-planetary disc is strong. Numerical models that trace how planetary orbits interact and change can explain the migration of planets to Hot Jupiter orbits (e.g., Trilling et al, 1998). More importantly, for studies of our own Solar System, these models also reveal the way that such planetary migrations stir",

            "text": "Applying the well-established analytic methods of secular theory, we have demonstrated that a solar obliquity of order several degrees is an expected observable effect of Planet Nine. Moreover, for a range of masses and orbits of Planet Nine that are broadly consistent with those predicted by Batygin & Brown (2016); Brown & Batygin (2016), Planet Nine is capable of reproducing the observed solar obliquity of 6 degrees, from a nearly coplanar configuration. The existence of Planet Nine therefore provides a tangible explanation for the spinorbit misalignment of the solar system. \n\nWithin the context of the Planet Nine hypothesis, a strictly null tilt of the solar spin-axis is disallowed. However, as already mentioned above, in addition to the longterm gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine, numerous other physical processes are thought to generate stellar obliquities (see e.g. Crida & Batygin 2014 and the references therein). A related question then, concerns the role of Planet Nine with respect to every other plausible misalignment mechanism. Within the context of our model, this question is informed by the present-day offset between the longitudes of ascending node of Planet Nine and the Sun, \u2206 \u2126. Particularly, if we assume that the solar system formed in a configuration that was strictly co-planar with the sun's equator, the observable combination of the parameters m 9 , a 9 , e 9 , i 9 maps onto a unique value of the observable parameter \u2206 \u2126. \n\nImportantly, our calculations suggest that if the orbit of Planet Nine resides in approximately the same plane as the orbits of the a 250 AU Kuiper belt objects (which inform the existence of Planet Nine in the first place), then the inferred range of \u2206 \u2126 and Planet Nine's expected orbital elements are incompatible with an exactly co-linear initial state of the solar spin axis. Instead, backwards integrations of the equations of motion suggest that a primordial spin-orbit misalignment of the same order as the RMS spread of the planetary inclination (i \u223c 1 deg) is consistent with the likely orbital configuration of Planet Nine.",

We now know of thousands of exoplanets 16 and have learned that such worlds are far more diverse than we ever expected based on our system. Despite this great unveiling, we have yet to discover the true place of the Solar system among its siblings. Is the Solar system's architecture common or unusual? Are planetary systems like our own rare or the norm? 17 Because of the challenges involved in finding Earth-sized planets on Earth-like orbits around Sun-like stars (e.g., Endl et al. 2015), a key focus of current research efforts is the search for, and study of, Jupiter and Saturn analogs-planets similar to the Solar system's two gas giants, moving on similar, longperiod orbits (e.g., Zechmeister et al. 2013;Wittenmyer et al. 2014;Rowan et al. 2016;Wittenmyer et al. 2016Fulton et al. 2021). The study of such objects can provide vital clues as to the degree to which the Solar system is unusual, helping to place our own planetary system in the context of the wider population. While the scientific value of such Solar system analogs is high, they remain challenging to detect, with the main exoplanet detection methods being strongly biased toward the discovery of planets in systems that are not like our own (see, e.g., Perryman 2018, and references therein).\n\nThe formation of planets is a byproduct of the formation of stars. Vast clouds of dust and gas collapse, leading to the formation of a protostar, surrounded by a circumstellar disk from which the planets form (e.g., Bodenheimer 1997;Mannings et al. 2000;Boss 2003). Initially, those planets form through the collisional accumulation of successively larger bodies (Wetherill 1990). If this process takes longer than the typical lifetime of the gaseous component of the circumstellar disk, the resulting planets will be comparable to the Solar system's terrestrial planets, whose accretion likely took around 10 8 yr to complete (e.g., Chambers 2004;Righter & O'Brien 2011).

In either case, our results contextualize the primordial solar obliquity within the emerging extrasolar trend of small spin-orbit misalignments in flat planetary systems (Morton & Winn 2014), and bring the computed value closer to the expectations of the nebular hypothesis. However, we note that at present, the range of unconstrained parameters also allows for evolutionary sequences in which Planet Nine's contribution does not play a dominant role in exciting the solar obliquity. \n\nThe integrable nature of the calculations performed in this work imply that observational characterization of Planet Nine's orbit will not only verify the expansion of the solar system's planetary album, but will yield remarkable new insights into the state of the solar system, at the time of its formation. That is, if Planet Nine is discovered in a configuration that contradicts a strictly aligned initial condition of the solar spin axis and planetary angular momentum, calculations of the type performed herein can be used to deduce the true primordial obliquity of the sun. In turn, this information can potentially constrain the mode of magnetospheric interactions between the young sun and the solar nebula (Konigl 1991;Lai et al. 2011;Spalding & Batygin 2015), as well as place meaningful limits on the existence of a putative primordial stellar companion of the sun (Batygin 2012;Xiang-Gruess & Papaloizou 2014). \n\nFinally, this work provides not only a crude test of the likely parameters of Planet Nine, but also a test of the viability of the Planet Nine hypothesis. By definition, Planet Nine is hypothesized to be a planet having parameters sufficient to induce the observed orbital clustering of Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis a > 250 AU (Batygin & Brown 2016).",

However, since objects are typically captured with semimajor axes of order \u223c1000 au, they spend most of their time in the trans-Neptunian and inner Oort Cloud regions, where the secular effects of Planet Nine become important. To get a sense of the role that Planet Nine plays in the orbital evolution of our captured objects, we performed a set of simulations on \u223c40,000 of our captures in which we included a 10 M \u2295 body with a = 500 au, e = 0.6, and i = 18\u00b0at a random phase. These simulations yielded rich dynamics that did not appear in the simulations including only the four known giant planets. While no trans-Neptunian objects were produced in our simulations with only the four known giant planets (though we emphasize again that they may have been generated if we had included galactic or cluster tides), our simulations including Planet Nine produced several such cases. Some objects displayed the wellunderstood behavior in which Planet Nine causes their orbital planes to tilt, sometimes even switching between prograde and retrograde. Finally, we note that some objects in these simulations were able to achieve osculating pericenter distances of up to 600 au (i.e., Planet Nine injected them into the inner Oort Cloud). It is worth noting that this result is essentially the inverse of the process discovered by Batygin & Brown (2021), in which Planet Nine injects inner Oort Cloud objects into the trans-Neptunian region of the solar system, and may warrant further investigation.",

Four planets orbiting HR 8799 have been monitored regularly since their discovery, providing the astrometric data needed to estimate their orbital properties and masses. The current astrometric data indicate that all four planets are less than 13 M Jup (Fabrycky & Murray-Clay 2010;Marois et al. 2010;Currie et al. 2011;Pueyo et al. 2014).\n\nThe planets are frequently observed for the purposes of characterizing their atmospheric properties and, in particular, their chemical compositions. The two outer most planets, b and c, have the most comprehensive wavelength coverage including near-infrared (near-IR) spectroscopy at low, R \u223c50-100 (Bowler et al. 2010;Barman et al. 2011a;Oppenheimer et al. 2013) and medium, R \u223c 4000 (Konopacky et al. 2013) resolutions. The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) has measured low-resolution spectra of planets c and d (Macintosh et al. 2014;Ingraham et al. 2014). Spectroscopy of multiple planets orbiting HR 8799 allows direct comparisons of atmospheric compositions for a coeval set of planets formed from the same protoplanetary disk. The only other planetary system for which such a comparison is currently feasible is our own Solar System.\n\nThe giant planets in our Solar System were likely born with bulk compositions determined by their initial location in the planetary disk and the specific solid-to-gas (M solid /M gas ) accretion history they experienced. As these initially hot planets cooled with time, their atmospheres experienced various levels of vertical mixing and condensation. The atmospheric composition may have been further altered by continued accretion of solid bodies or mixing with a deep metal-rich core. Consequently, the present-day mole fractions for important trace molecules (H 2 O, CH 4 , CO 2 , CO, NH 3 , and N 2 ) of giant planets in our Solar System are the result of numerous chemical and physical processes. Inferring elemental abundances from molecular abundances requires a clear understanding of the atmospheric chemical and dynamical history.

From orbital monitoring and modeling, the four planets are thought to be within a few degrees of coplanarity, and at or near 1:2:4:8 resonance (Fabrycky & Murray-Clay 2010;Soummer et al. 2011;Pueyo et al. 2015;Konopacky et al. 2016;Zurlo et al. 2016;Wertz et al. 2017;Wang et al. 2018b;Gravity Collaboration et al. 2019;O'Neil et al. 2019;Ruffio et al. 2019;Go\u017adziewski & Migaszewski 2020).

            "text": "Over the past few years the detection of planets outside the Solar System, the so called exoplanets, has greatly stimulated the stability studies of planetary systems. New exoplanets are being discovered on a regular basis; more than 150 (April, 2005) exoplanets are now known. There are 136 systems consisting of a central star and a gaseous giant planet, and 14 multiple systems with two, three and four planets. The so far discovered exoplanets have a minimum mass range (m \u2022 sin(ip)) from 0.042 mJ to 17.5 mJ where mJ is Jupiter's mass and ip is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the plane of the sky. Since ip is unknown a precise mass cannot be determined, only a lower mass limit. Because of the technical limitations only planets of Neptune mass or above can be detected and then only if they are less than 5 AU or so from the star1 . Therefore more than 90 % of these planets are orbiting their host star well inside Jupiter's orbit. There are major differences between the characteristics of the so far observed systems and those of the Solar System. Most of the planets have minimum masses substantially greater than that of Jupiter -up to six or even more times the mass of Jupiter. Dozens of planets are orbiting very close to their hosting star, with semimajor axes down to 0.04 AU. Finally, planetary orbits are found with large eccentricities, up to approximately 0.7, plus a few greater, significantly greater than the highest eccentricities observed for planets in our Solar System. These characteristics are depicted in Fig. 1, where the planets' eccentricities are plotted against their semimajor axes, the locations of the Earth, Jupiter and Saturn are marked as diamonds. From Fig. 1 it is apparent that our planetary system may serve as model case for those planetary systems which have small eccentricities. Presumably these are also the ones where we may expect stable terrestrial planets moving in habitable zones (Asghari et al. 2004). \n\nIn previous papers (Dvorak & S\u00fcli 2002;Dvorak et al. 2005) the dynamical evolution of a simplified Solar system was studied. The model consisted of the Sun, the three most massive terrestrial planets (Venus, Earth, Mars), Jupiter and Saturn.",

As a last non-nominal model with M=10 M \u2295 , we also examined the possibility that candidate Planet 9 might be a super-Earth without any significant atmosphere and an Earth-like interior. We found that the planet would have a radius of about 1.9 R \u2295 . Assuming that the silicate mantel has a chondritic abundance of radionuclides (Mordasini et al. 2012), we found that its radiogenic luminosity is at the current age of the solar system about 6.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 L , which is remarkably only eight times lower than the total luminosity in the nominal case and about five times higher than the Earth's intrinsic luminosity (Kamland Collaboration et al. 2011). For the Earth it is estimated that about half of the intrinsic luminosity is radiogenic, and the other half originates from delayed secular cooling. The effective temperature is 38 K, only 9 K lower than in the nominal case because of the smaller radius, and the apparent magnitudes in V and Q are 23.2 and 15.2. \n\nEffect of the mass. In the bottom right panel of Fig. 3 we show apparent magnitudes in the V and Q band for the nominal planet and planets where the mass relative to the nominal case was varied. In general, the objects are brighter in the Q than in the V band. Since in the V band the reflected light of the Sun is visible, the objects become slightly brighter with time, corresponding to the evolution of the Sun. By contrast, the Q band shows the intrinsic radiation of the planet, and the planets slowly become fainter as a result of cooling. In addition to the nominal 10 M \u2295 case, the apparent magnitude evolution is shown in the figure for planets of 5, 20, and 50 M \u2295 . These planets have a present-day radius of 2.92, 4.62, and 6.32 R \u2295 , an intrinsic luminosity of 0.0018, 0.016, and 0.078 L , and an effective temper-  ature of 40, 54, and 69 K, respectively.",

            "text": "Planetary science beyond the boundaries of our Solar System is today in its infancy. Until a couple of decades ago, the detailed investigation of the planetary properties was restricted to objects orbiting inside the Kuiper Belt. Today, we cannot ignore that the number of known planets has increased by two orders of magnitude nor that these planets resemble anything but the objects present in our own Solar System. Whether this fact is the result of a selection bias induced by the kind of techniques used to discover new planets-mainly radial velocity and transit-or simply the proof that the Solar System is a rarity in the Milky Way, we do not know yet. What is clear, though, is that the Solar System has failed to be the paradigm not only in our Galaxy but even 'just' in the solar neighbourhood. This finding, although unsettling, forces us to reconsider our knowledge of planets under a different light and perhaps question a few of the theoretical pillars on which we base our current 'understanding'. The next decade will be critical to advance in what we should perhaps call Galactic planetary science. In this paper, I review highlights and pitfalls of our current knowledge of this topic and elaborate on how this knowledge might arguably evolve in the next decade. More critically, I identify what should be the mandatory scientific and technical steps to be taken in this fascinating journey of remote exploration of planets in our Galaxy.",

            "text": "For comparison, we also plot several combinations of the solar system planets in Figure 3 as cyan markers. We consider three groupings: (1) the inner solar system, composed of just the four terrestrial planets (hollow square), (2) the terrestrial planets and Jupiter (filled pentagon), and finally, (3) the full solar system with all eight planets (filled pentagon). Both the inner and the full solar system have very similar gap complexities ( = \uf043 0.126 and 0.119, respectively), which are lower than that of any KGPS inner system with OGs. The motivation for considering grouping (2) is based on the detection limit for the KGPS survey, which is sensitive to giant planets out to separations roughly between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. Since Jupiter is well separated from the terrestrial planets by the asteroid belt, the gap complexity is modestly increased, in contrast to most of the KGPS systems with OG planets.\n\nWhile Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are typically all thought of as \"giant\" planets, with Jupiter being the prototypical example, we note that these planets technically do not meet our definition of an OG as used throughout this paper because both Uranus and Neptune are less massive than 50M \u2295 and exterior to all of the other planets. However, the KGPS survey was not sensitive to less massive planets beyond \u223c10 au (e.g., Uranus and Neptune analogs). Thus, it may be unremarkable that the full solar system has a lower gap complexity than any of the KGPS systems with an OG. Nevertheless, it is intriguing that despite the existence of Jupiter (and Saturn), the inner solar system also has a relatively low gap complexity compared to the inner KGPS systems with an OG planet.",

            "text": "The existence of one or more undetected Earth or Neptune-sized planets in our solar system with large perihelion distance has been suggested in recent years by several authors. Trujillo & Sheppard (2014), Batygin & Brown (2016), and Malhotra et al. (2016) have made the case for a Planet 9 with mass of order 10 Earth masses and distance of order 700 AU. Brown & Batygin (2016) constrain the mass of such a planet to 5 to 20 Earth masses, and its semi-major axis to between 380 and 980 AU. Volk & Malhotra (2017) make the case for an additional planetary object with mass 0.1 to 2.4 Earth masses and a distance of 60 to 100 AU. In general, the presence of additional planets beyond 1000 AU is poorly constrained. We will refer to any undetected planet in the solar system generically as Planet X. \n\nSearches in the optical for detecting Planet 9 via reflected sunlight are underway with wide-field instruments such as the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam, Pan-STARRS and the Dark Energy Survey with the Blanco telescope (e.g. Sheppard et al. 2018;Weryk et al. 2016;Bernardinelli et al. 2019, S. More, private communication). Cowan et al. (2016) (henceforth CHK) note that ebax@sas.upenn.edu for reasonable assumptions, the expected temperature of Planet 9 is in the range 28-53 Kelvin, so the peak thermal emission is at submillimeter wavelengths and natural datasets to pursue this signal are surveys designed to map the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) at millimeter wavelengths. They also note that at an approximate distance of 700 AU, the parallax motion of Planet 9 would be a few arcseconds per day (or about 10 arcminutes per six months), which would dominate over its proper motion. So a CMB survey with roughly arcminute resolution that repeats coverage of the same part of sky every few months could potentially detect Planet 9 as a moving source. The sensitivity and angular resolution requirements are discussed in detail by CHK, who note that such a planet would be at the edge of detectability by Planck.",

            "text": "For these systems, models of planet formation could be used to produce a hypothetical distribution of small bodies, but this would lead us to undesirable complex simulations and heavy computational load. Hence, we accept the fact that their current population of small bodies is unknown, and suggest another kind of method of analysis. \n\nIn our approach we follow the evolution of a specific hypothetical population of small bodies which is common to all of the planetary systems under study. Our purpose is to isolate and characterize the small-body scattering properties of the planets, and to provide a technique to compare different planetary systems in this respect. If we can show that a certain configuration of planets is considerably more efficient in scattering small bodies than another one, we could argue that the actual small-body flux is less intense in that system, taken that the initial conditions in both systems are similar. Wetherill (1994) used this idea when he considered alternative giant-planet formation scenarios in our Solar System. Using \u00d6pik-Arnold calculations he followed the evolution of cometary test bodies and concluded that the absence of Jupiter would increase the cratering rate on Earth throughout its history by a factor of 100-1000. \n\nThe dynamically dominant role of Jupiter in the Solar System was also shown by Everhart (1968), in the case of parabolic comets. \n\nIn this paper we will present computational tools to measure the gravitational scattering properties of a planetary system. First, in Sect. 2, we will introduce a \"benchmark\" integration scenario with thousands of cometary small bodies to be integrated numerically along the planetary system under study. The small bodies are initially in orbits that cross the HZ of the system. We will also define a variable, the escape rate, that describes the strength at which the planetary system scatters the small bodies into orbits that no longer threaten the HZ. In Sect. 3, we will present some preliminary results obtained using the tools above. We have considered hypothetical giant-planet configurations based on the Solar System and especially evaluated the dynamical significance of Jupiter. Later, we will show some results on selected extrasolar planetary systems. In Sect. 4 we will discuss the interpretation of the results.",

It is important to note that while planet-planet scatterings can explain the orbits of single planets on wide and moderately eccentric orbits (like e.g. Formalhaut b), it is very unlikely that systems like HR8799 formed this way. HR8799 consists of three planets which all appear to be on rather circular orbits (Marois et al. 2008). Furthermore, it is also likely that at least two of the planets are locked in a 2:1 mean motion resonance (Fabrycky & Murray-Clay 2010). \n\nIn Fig. 10 we show a snapshot of the semi-major axes and eccentricities of the four gas-giant planets in the solar system, 10 8 years after a fly-by with rmin < 100 au and mI = 0.6M\u2299. At this time, about five per cent of systems contain at least one planet with semi-major axis larger than 100 au, which are planets that could be observed in imaging surveys.",

            "text": "According to the existing ideas of the formation of the Solar System its planetary structure is held unchanged during about 4.5 billion years. Such a static situation of the things had been embodied, particularly, in offered in 1766 Titius-Bode's rule of the orbital distances for known at that time the seven planets from Mercury to Uranus. As it is known, the conformity to this rule for planets Neptune and Pluto discovered subsequently has appeared much worse than for before known seven planets. However, the essential departures of the real orbital distances from this rule for these two planets so far have not obtained any explained justifying within the framework of such conservative insights into a structure of the Solar System. But in this regard to the Solar System a certain progress has recently been achieved. Accordingly to the results of the recent computer simulation (Batygin et al 2012) the Solar System at th\u0435 early stage of its dynamic evolution could have five outer planets (two gas giants and three icy giants). In other paper devoted to a possible fifth giant ex-planet (Nesvorn\u00fd 2011) its author find that \"the icy giants can form more easily at \u2039 15 AU from the Sun\". Besides from, there by means of the computer simulation among other a case with its mass intermediate between that of Saturn and Uranus was tested. However, it is noteworthy, more appropriately the orbital and physical characteristics of this former fifth giant planet possibly at a rather recent epoch yet have not been determined and its possible remnants in the Solar System went unrecognized. Here, we state our approach to solve this problem and by that we try to give a key to unveiling some existing astronomical puzzles of the outer Solar System. In years of the planetary researches of the Solar System by the ground-based telescopes and Voyager and Cassini space missions a number of outstanding questions has been amassed on which as yet evidently there are no enough convincing answers. As it is known, the present-day planetary science has no an reasonably acceptable explanation for some puzzling astronomical facts, in particular, for that of an unambiguous origin of the rings and irregular moons of the giant planets, e. g., the largest retrograde moon of the Solar System Triton.",

            "text": "Abstract The \u201cGrand Tack\u201d model proposes that the inner Solar System was sculpted by the giant planets' orbital migration in the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Jupiter first migrated inward then Jupiter and Saturn migrated back outward together. If Jupiter's turnaround or \u201ctack\u201d point was at ~ 1.5 AU the inner disk of terrestrial building blocks would have been truncated at ~ 1 AU, naturally producing the terrestrial planets' masses and spacing. During the gas giants' migration the asteroid belt is severely depleted but repopulated by distinct planetesimal reservoirs that can be associated with the present-day S and C types. The giant planets' orbits are consistent with the later evolution of the outer Solar System. Here we confront common criticisms of the Grand Tack model. We show that some uncertainties remain regarding the Tack mechanism itself; the most critical unknown is the timing and rate of gas accretion onto Saturn and Jupiter. Current isotopic and compositional measurements of Solar System bodies \u2013 including the D/H ratios of Saturn's satellites \u2013 do not refute the model. We discuss how alternate models for the formation of the terrestrial planets each suffer from an internal inconsistency and/or place a strong and very specific requirement on the properties of the protoplanetary disk. We conclude that the Grand Tack model remains viable and consistent with our current understanding of planet formation. Nonetheless, we encourage additional tests of the Grand Tack as well as the construction of alternate models.",

The results of the 10 Myr simulations are much like the shorter ones. The mean number of surviving planets decreases from N \u223c 2.5 to N \u223c 2 over this time interval. The mean eccentricity also decreases and suggests that the high eccentricity planets are the ones lost from the system. The mean mass of the surviving planets increases, as expected if the smaller planets are more likely to be ejected. We also performed another set of simulations that start with one large planet and 19 smaller bodies. The large planet has the mass of Jupiter and begins with a semi-major axis a 0 = 5 AU (much like the orbit of Jupiter in our solar system). The 19 smaller bodies have randomly chosen masses that are uniformly distributed over the range 0 \u2264 m \u2264 0.5 m J . These smaller bodies begin in circular orbits with radii evenly distributed in ln r over the range 3 AU \u2264 r \u2264 30 AU. This wider range of starting orbital radii was used so that the region inside the 'Jupiter' would be populated by smaller bodies. In this case, we have carried out N = 100 simulations to obtain a good statistical description of the outcomes. \n\nThe results show that the large planet migrates inward to become the innermost planet in 75 percent of the trials. For those cases in which the large planet becomes the innermost planet, the relevant orbital parameters exhibit distributions characterized by a = 2.08 AU \u00b1 1.28 AU, and \u01eb = 0.36 \u00b1 0.20. This starting configuration is efficient at transporting the large planet inward. Half of the simulations end with the large planet at a < 2 AU, and 20 percent of the trials result -15in a < 1.5 AU. However, only one trial places the large planet with semi-major axis a < 1 AU. This effective boundary at about 1 AU can be understood on energetic grounds (see \u00a73.3 and the Appendix).",

That was because of one of its requirements that a celestial body should clear its neighborhood for it to qualify as a planet [36]. Another flaw in the IAU definition of planet is that it has no inherent limit regarding the number of planets in our solar system. It is an open cheque. We saw in this article that the distribution of planets, moons and planetary ring-system in the solar system is systematic and predictable, and there is a limit to the possible number of planets in the solar system. Yet another flaw in the IAU definition of planet is that, by limiting the definition of planet to the solar system, it gives a false (although unintended) impression that planets exist only in our solar system. Such serious flaws in the IAU definition of planet warrant a radical revision of the definition of planet. A new and better definition of planet has become necessary.

The other planets which have noticeable influence on the evolution of the disk are, in descending order of magnitude, Venus, Jupiter and -to a lesser extent -Mars. The effects of Mercury and planets beyond Jupiter are negligible. The results of our final, highest resolution, simulation with 36000 particles and including Venus, Earth, Mars and Jupiter (which we refer to as the VEMJ simulation) are shown in Figs. 9 -11. All of the additional planets are placed at their present semi-major axes but with zero mutual inclination and near circular orbits (e 10 \u22123 ). The initial true anomalies are randomised. Such a set-up is beneficial in reducing the number of degrees of freedom in the system. In addition the current mutual inclination and eccentricity state of the orbits of the Solar System planets are not necessarily representative of that at 50 Myr after the formation of the solar system, both since the planets undergo secular interactions over long timescales and models of the formation of the Solar System such as the Nice model (e.g. Tsiganis et al. 2005;Brasser et al. 2009;Morbidelli et al. 2009) suggest that the orbits of the planets have changed since formation. In addition the present mutual inclinations of the Solar System planets ( 3 \u2022 ) are less than the typical inclinations of the debris particles (see Fig. 2) and as such using the present mutual inclinations of the planets would not significantly change the mutual inclinations between the planets and the debris. Similarly, although non-zero, the present eccentricities of the Solar System planets are not large enough to be likely to have significant effects. The only planets for which the present non-zero eccentricity initially seems that it might have an effect are Mars and Mercury since their eccentricities of 0.1 and 0.2 bring them 10 and 20 per cent closer to 1 AU, into denser parts of the debris disk. However the time they spend closer to 1 AU is largely offset by the time they spend further from 1 AU; for example, their mean orbital distances, a = a(1 + 1 2 e 2 ), differ from their semi-major axes by only 0.5 and 2 per cent respectively.",

This transformation was further fueled by the discovery of exoplanetary systems, and the recognition that an improved understanding of our solar system will inform our understanding of exoplanetary systems. In turn, the sheer number and diversity of exoplanetary systems places our solar system in context, and informs our understanding of its formation and evolution.\n\nGiant Planet Exospheres. The details of the physical interaction of the outer atmospheres of planets (their \"exospheres\") with their local environments are essential for understanding atmospheric mass loss and the habitability of rocky planets. Planetary aurorae trace the interaction of stellar winds, which can erode atmospheres, with planetary magnetic fields, which can serve to protect those atmospheres from such winds. Thus, by studying these aurorae, the physics of the interactions between planets and their host stars, and how these interactions may affect the habitability of their planets, can begin to be understood. Observations of the tenuous outer atmospheres (exospheres) of planets in our solar system will help elucidate the physics of atmospheric escape, which can then be applied to better understand the observations of evaporating planets in other planetary systems.\n\nOrigin of Earth's Water. There is considerable controversy over the origin of water on Earth. The raw materials from which Earth was assembled were likely essentially devoid of water. Thus, the water content of Earth almost certainly originated from a population of waterrich bodies beyond the 'snow line,' which is estimated to be at ~2.7 AU for the solar system. There are three leading hypotheses for the primary reservoir from which the water of the Earth was delivered: the outer asteroid belt, which is known to be rich in volatiles; Jupiter-family comets, which likely originated from the trans-Neptunian belt; and long-period comets, which originated from much further out in the solar system. These three sources can be distinguished by their deuterium to hydrogen ratio, which is well measured for the Earth's oceans and is known to be quite distinct for asteroids, Jupiterfamily and long-period comets. However, these measurements are quite challenging, and there have been only a handful of",

The population of observable circulating objects dominates the observable aligned population, as the aligned objects are only stable at very high (and thus hard to observe) q values. In light of this, a closer examination of the distribution of circulating objects may allow for stricter conclusions on the semimajor axis of Planet Nine and presents an important avenue for future work.\n\nMore importantly, we find that the two incarnations of the distant Kuiper Belt are indeed distinct. As all low-q objects are depleted due to secular interactions with Planet Nine, the main difference between the narrow and broad Kuiper Belt distributions is in the existence of high-q aligned objects. Thus, the presence of high-q aligned objects in our solar system would not only lend support for the existence of Planet Nine but would indicate that our current Kuiper Belt stems from an initially wide q-distribution. This, in turn, would signal that Planet Nine's formation likely involved stellar encounters, as this is the most likely mechanism that would create such a spread out Kuiper Belt.\n\nWe note that the above analysis entails a caveat. In our model, we only consider the behavior of the outer Kuiper Belt; once we initialize the \u223c10000 particles, those are the only objects whose evolution we consider. That is, we do not take into account objects that may have originated in the inner Kuiper Belt or Scattered Disk, and later were scattered out to sufficiently high a, thus falling into our population of interest. These objects could replenish certain regions of parameter space, such as the low-q aligned or the high-q anti-aligned regions, adding an influx of objects to the existing populations.\n\nThe objects that may be scattered into the outer solar system, however, will not become members of the two permanently stable populations identified in this work (low-q anti-aligned and high-q aligned). Instead, these objects will replenish the orbital configurations that are eventually driven to centaur-like orbits and are then rapidly ejected from the solar system. As a result, these objects are only metastable, as their lifetimes are generally shorter than one libration in \u0394\u03d6, a process which lasts <1 Gyr. Even so, carefully modeling the flux of these scattered objects in the outer solar system",

The He abundance is highly uncertain [49][50][51], and only the abundances of N, C, and P, have been quantified [52][53][54][55][56]. This scarcity of essential data is the main motivation for sending an atmospheric probe to Saturn and was the core of several mission proposals submitted to ESA and NASA calls over the last decade [57][58][59]. Uranus and Neptune are the most distant planets in our Solar System. Their apparent size in the sky is roughly a factor of 10 smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, which makes telescopic observations from Earth much more challenging in terms of detectability. This distance factor is probably also the reason why space agencies have not yet sent any new flyby or orbiter mission to either of these planets since Voyager 2. As a consequence, the knowledge of their bulk composition is dramatically poor (see Fig. 1), resulting in a very limited understanding of their formation and evolution. Improving this situation needs ground-truth measurements that can only be carried out in these distant planets by an atmospheric probe, similarly to the Galileo probe at Jupiter. Table 3 represents the isotopic ratio measurements realized in the atmospheres of the four giant planets of our Solar System. The case of D/H is interesting and would deserve further measurements with smaller errors. Because deuterium is destroyed in stellar interiors and transformed into 3 He, the D/H value presently measured in Jupiter's atmosphere is estimated to be larger by some 5-10% than the protosolar value. This slight enrichment would have resulted from a mixing of nebular gas with deuterium-rich ices during the planet's formation. For Saturn, the contribution of deuterium-rich ices in the present D/H ratio could be higher (25-40%). The deuterium enrichment as measured by [73] in Uranus and Neptune has been found to be very similar between the two planets, and its supersolar value also suggests that significant mixing occurred between the protosolar H 2 and the H 2 O ice accreted by the planets. Assuming that the D/H ratio in H 2 O ice accret",

            "text": "Just over 20 years ago, we were completely unaware of the existence of any planets outside our own solar system. Known as extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, the first were detected in 1992 [1], but rather than orbiting a Sun-like star, these two exoplanets were detected in orbit around a pulsar: the remnant core of a massive star. The first extrasolar planet detected around a Sun-like star was discovered in 1995 [2]. What was remarkable about this planet is that it was estimated to have a mass similar to that of Jupiter, but was orbiting its parent star every 4.2 days, meaning that it is closer to its star than Mercury is to the Sun. \n\nSince 1995, we have confirmed the existence of more than 1800 exoplanets, in orbit around just over 1100 stars. The properties of many of these extrasolar planetary systems are quite different to what we might have expected based on our own solar system. Our Solar System has eight planets-four inner rocky/terrestrial planets and four outer gas/ice giants-in orbits that lie in approximately the same plane and that are close to being circular. As already mentioned, the first exoplanet discovered around a Sun-like star was Jupiter-like, but orbiting extremely close to its parent star. Many of these close-in exoplanets, known as 'hot' Jupiters, have since been discovered. Additionally, many exoplanets have highly eccentric (non-circular) orbits [3], unlike the planets in our own solar system. \n\nIn the last few years, we have also started observing massive, gas giant (Jupiter-like) planets at large distances from their parent stars [4]; more distant than the outermost planets in our own solar system. Essentially, we now have a large sample of exoplanets with a wide range of properties and characteristics, some of which are unexpected and surprising. We are also starting to be able to directly image some exoplanets [5] and are beginning to be able to determine the spectra of exoplanet atmospheres, the first step towards determining the presence of biosignatures [6] and whether or not an exoplanet could be habitable.",

            "text": "The presence of exoplanets with wide orbits, the possible existence of 9th planets in our solar system [13,14] and the discovery of a population of free-floating planets [1] led to the hypothesis of the capture of free-floating planets in planetary systems due to the variable gravitational field of a star and a giant planet [7,8,11,15]. In the case of the solar system, it is the Sun and Jupiter. In [9], detailed calculations of the capture cross-section were performed. \n\nIn this paper, we have shown that capture into an already formed planetary system is not the only capture option, but there is also the possibility of capture into a collapsing protostellar cloud at the stage before the formation of a star. Despite the fact that the compression of the cloud in the free fall mode lasts for a short time, during this period there is a strong change in the gravitational potential. In addition, the size of the collapsing cloud is much larger than the size of Jupiter's orbit. Both of these factors lead to the fact that the probability of capture in a collapsing cloud is comparable to the probability of capture in an already formed planetary system. \n\nThe capture of free-floating planets is most likely in a protostellar cloud that exists as part of the star formation region, where the number density of lost planets is quite large. According to modern concepts, confirmed by isotope analysis, the solar system at an early stage of its life was in a stellar association formed during the fragmentation of a single giant cloud. Subsequently, this association dissipated as a result of dynamic processes. \n\nThe 9th planet, the evidence of which on the periphery of the solar system was obtained by Batygin et al. [13,14], could be captured both in a planetary system and in a contracting protosolar cloud. It is also possible to capture the PBHs from the Galactic halo into a planetary system or into a contracting cloud. However, the PBH capture probability is extremely small due to the large velocity dispersion of the objects in Galactic halo. \n\nThis work is supported by the Russian Science Foundation grant 23-22-00013, https://rscf.ru/en/project/23-22-00013/",

            "text": "Klahr (2010); Lambrechts and Johansen (2012) proposed that the accretion of pebbles with size of 1-100 cm can be high enough to corroborate Assumption D, since they rapidly loose their excess energy and angular momentum through the interaction with gas. Indeed, substantial amounts of solid particles are expected to be mostly in the form of pebbles (Lambrechts and Johansen, 2012). Although it is likely to help the formation of gas giants and icy planets (Neptune and Uranus; Lambrechts and Johansen (2014)), the formation of terrestrial planets is unclear. In fact, according to the simulation of planet formation by Kretke and Levison (2014), hundreds of Mars-and Earth-mass objects between 4-10 AU are formed, instead of several giant planet cores larger than 10 Earth-mass, which are necessary to capture gas to become a gas giant. Such a system is not likely to be a planetary system similar to our solar system. Although Levison et al. (2015) found that this difficulty would overcome if pebbles formation continued in the disk during 10 7 yrs, though any reasons of the continued formation of pebbles are not known.\n\nHansen (2009) assumed a narrow annulus composed of 400 planetesimals between 0.7 and 1.0 AU for the planetesimal-growth stage to construct a planet system similar to the solar system. The total mass of the planetesimals in the torus is set to be 2 Earth masses, and the corresponding averagecolumn density is about 10 times higher than that of MMSN model. They found that four terrestrial planets are produced just like our solar system in most cases. In order to explain this rather artificial distribution of planetesimals,  and  used outer gas planets, Jupiter and Saturn. They assumed that Jupiter first forms with subsequent migration inward down to 1.5-2 AU. Then, Saturn grows and migrates to be eventually locked in 2:3 resonance with Jupiter. The resonated pair of the planets migrates outward back to 5 and 7 AU. Jupiter directs planetesimals inward by gravitational scattering to form a narrow torus of planetesimals around 1 AU. This model, named the \"Grand Tack Model\", has become popular, though it is theoretically uncertain how Jupiter",

            "text": "Studies of the formation and evolution of planetary systems have entered into a new extremely dynamic phase of the development. One of the main reasons for that is the fact that the Solar System is no longer the only planetary system known in our Galaxy. Many other planetary systems have been discovered till now and they are observed at different stages of their evolution. They provide distinct realizations of the same set of processes which were responsible for the formation of our Solar System. \n\nThe discovery of extrasolar planetary systems took place when the dynamical structure of our Solar System was relatively well understood. After the work of Copernicus (1543), Kepler (1609Kepler ( , 1619)), Galilei (1632) and Newton (1687), it became clear that the observed motion of the objects in our planetary system is a consequence of the gravitational force. Newton showed that the Kepler laws are natural outcomes of the inverse square law of the universal gravitational force. If the Earth would be the only planet going around our Sun then its orbit would be a closed ellipse around the common center of the mass of the system. However, there are also other planets orbiting the Sun, which perturb the trajectory of the Earth. The interactions between the planets cause that the orbit of our planet precesses in space. Such motion can be followed very accurately with a help of modern computers. A search for regularities in the motion of planets consisted not only in trying to understand the motion of a single planet but also in the determination of the relative distances between planetary orbits. Kepler (1596) suggested a geometrical model which reproduced quite well the observational data available at that time. The next attempt to model the relative distances of planets in the Solar System is known today as the Titius-Bode law. This empirical law in its original form states that the mean distance d from the Sun to each of the six (known to Titius) planets can be approximated by the relation \n\nwhere i = \u2212\u221e, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and d is given in astronomical units (AU). Modern observations show however that the structure of our Solar System is much more complex than what can be predicted from these simplified models. An enormous influence on the planetary system dynamical structure is exerted by an apparently small gravitational effect caused by the resonance phenomenon.",

            "text": "It is important to have an overview of possibly stable terrestrial planets in known multiple planetary systems with gas giants (Agnew et al., 2018). Nevertheless, we think that each system should be treated separately because of the different architecture. The dynamical stability of additional -possibly terrestrial -planets in a planetary systems with gas giants is only one side of the coin, the other side is to know how these planets could have formed. The present knowledge is that in our Solar System the gas giants formed prior to the terrestrial planets in the Solar environment of gas and dust. Different scenarios are possible (e.g., Grand Tack as described by Morbidelli et al., 2011). We know that in our Solar System no stable terrestrial planet could exist between Jupiter and Saturnthey all formed inside the Jovian zone. \n\nWe looked into the literature to find an interesting system quite similar to our own and found that HD 141399 would be a good example (Vogt et al., 2014). The HZ in HD 141399 is located between two gas giants (see Table 2), namely between planet c (a = 0.7 au) and planet d (a = 2.1 au). Calculation of the boundary values for the habitable zone shows that it lies between 0.8 au and 2.0 au from the star (Selsis et al., 2007). \n\nHD 141399 is a K0V star with m = 1.07 m Sun , r = 1.46 r Sun , and T eff = 5600 K. The system was presented by Vogt et al. (2014) who used radial velocity data sets from Keck-HIRES and the Lick Observatory's Automated Planet Finder Telescope and Levy Spectrometer on Mt. Hamilton. 91 observations from over 10.5 yrs were analyzed and the parameters of four planets shown in close to the 2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR) which might give a clue on the history of the system. Vogt et al. (2014) argue, that a possible inward migration would point towards a capture in resonance, which cannot be the case, given the values derived from the observations.",

The Sun comprises nearly all of the matter in the Solar System, reaching up to 99.86% of total mass and is expected to have a nearly zero acceleration in the Solar System frame, https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/. According to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, each object will travel along an ellipse with the Sun being approximately stationary at one of the focal points. Consequently, the closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it will revolve around it and the smaller its orbital period. Therefore, by the time an outer planet (e.g. Jupiter) \n\ncompletes a full revolution, an inner planet (like Venus) will have already completed several orbits. \n\nIn particular, in our simulations, we have integrated the system over such a time interval such that Uranus and Neptune orbits have not closed (see the black and purple lines in Fig. 5). \n\nWe treat the Solar System as a N = 9 body problem, where the initial conditions and masses of the planets have all been normalized in terms of the Earth's. We consider a system of units in which the mass of the Earth is taken to be m Earth = 1. The mass of the Sun and of the other planets are then computed according to the relative mass ratio normalized to m Earth , https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview/. The initial conditions are given in Table III, where the conversion factor of 0.03 for the mass has been used so that the ratio between distances and masses is realistic in our numerical model. In order to conserve momentum at the center of mass frame (which almost coincides with the position of the Sun), we take the initial positions and momenta of the planets to cancel out. Finally, we present the trajectories obtained from the numerical calculation in Fig. 5. \n\nWe also give the energy over time in Fig. 6, where we notice that the fluctuations displayed are within the error margin of the 4-stage Runge-Kutta method. Nevertheless, it is approximately constant as expected from a theoretical standpoint.",

That one might consider such an apparently catastrophic model with a degree of confidence is the result of more than a decade of observations of giant planets in a rich variety of orbits around other stars, the evidence from their orbital properties of significant dynamical interactions ( Juri\u0107 & Tremaine 2008), and the detection by microlensing of a sufficient number of free-floating planets (Sumi et al. 2011). These suggest that giant planet migration and interactions, even catastrophic, might be the rule rather than the exception. Applying this line of thinking to our own solar system leads to solutions for the small size of Mars, the structure of the asteroid belt, and the origin of water on Earth. However, numerous key problems remain, including the correct treatment of accreting versus nonaccreting impacts and the geochemistry of the planetesimals from the giant planet region that seeded Earth with water.\n\nThe future observations required to test this picture are multidisciplinary, ranging from in situ studies of comets to astronomical observations of protoplanetary disks around other stars. Starting in our solar system and moving outward, the following key studies are needed:\n\nObservations of asteroids that better tie meteorite types to their asteroidal parent bodies: For example, the geochemistry of Ceres, to be assessed by the Dawn mission, and sample return missions from primitive asteroids will give us more confidence in our associations of meteorite classes with specific asteroid types. A more comprehensive inventory of D/H in water in solar system bodies: This is key to understanding the connections and differences between primitive asteroids and comets, which, in turn, are diagnostic for models of implantation of primitive objects into the asteroid belt from a cometary reservoir, such as the Grand Tack. Further observations of D/H in comets are forthcoming. Also, a better understanding of the D/H values in reservoirs of water on Mars would be helpful (Lunine et al. 2003).

            "text": "The search for new planets in the solar system has attracted much work over the centuries.In general, this has been prompted by the need to explain observed perturbations in the orbits of known planets, and has involved trying to observe the planets from their reflected sunlight in the optical region of the spectrum.The discovery of Uranus in 1781, Neptune in 1846 and Pluto in 1930 resulted from such work.Much more recently, analysis of perturbations in the orbits of objects in the Kuiper Belt has suggested the likelihood of these being caused by a planet further out in the solar system (see review in Batygin et al. 2019).\n\nObserving reflected sunlight is not the only method by which planets may be detected in the Solar System.Judging from the known giant planets, large planets are non-negligible sources of heat which may be detectible in the infrared.The peak of this radiation will depend on the temperature at the highest levels of the atmosphere of the planet, and will most likely be in the far-infrared (see Table 1).Since reflected sunlight will fall by r \u22124 with distance r from the Sun, detection of emitted thermal radiation (which will fall by r \u22122 ) becomes a much more likely method of detecting planets in the Solar System at greater distances from the Sun.Detection in this way using a planet's proper motion has only recently become possible, with two all-sky far-infrared catalogues now available, taken some 23 years apart.\n\nThe most distant giant planet currently known, Neptune, orbits the sun at a semi-major axis of \u223c 30 AU.The Kuiper Belt covers the region 30 AU to 55 AU and has three known dwarf planets (including Pluto) and numerous smaller objects (Kuiper Belt Objects, KBOs).A Neptune-sized planet at \u223c 700 AU was recently predicted to explain the eccentric orbits of several such objects ('Planet Nine'; Batygin & Brown 2016).Our longer term objective is to cover this region, but this initial paper only reaches its edge, covering from 700 AU out to almost the beginning of the Oort Cloud, which is generally thought to extend from \u223c 10,000 AU to 100,000 AU.",

            "text": "Looking at a starry sky, it is quite vertiginous to think that we are at one of these special epochs in history: Just before, we only knew of the planets in our Solar System. Now, more than 150 giant planets are known to orbit solar-like stars. Our giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are no longer the only ones that we can characterize. We now know of six extrasolar giant planets transiting in front of their stars, for which we can measure with a fair accuracy their mass and radius. We lie on the verge of a true revolution: With ground-based and future space-based transit search programs, we should soon be able to detect and characterize many tens, probably hundreds of planets orbiting their stars, with the hope of inferring their composition and hence the mechanisms responsible for the formation of planets. \n\nIt is a daunting task too, because we should expect that, like for the planets in our Solar System, a rich variety of giant planets is found, with different compositions, different histories and a number of new or unexpected physical mecanisms at work. We will have to classify observations, test theories, and be aware that although simplicity is appealing, it is not always what Nature has in store for us. \n\nThis review aims at providing a synthetic approach to the problems posed by \"old\" and \"new\" giant planets, in the Solar System and outside. It updates a previous review by Stevenson (1982), and expands on the review by Hubbard et al. (2002) by focusing on the mass-radius relations and compositions of giant planets. In Section 2, we see how to construct interior and evolution models of giant planets. Section 3 is devoted to our giant planets, what we can infer from observations, and the questions that remain. I then turn to the new field of extrasolar giant planets, focusing on the close-in, transiting \"Pegasi planets\" (also called \"hot Jupiters\"). The last section is an attempt to summarize some of the known facts concerning giant planets and provide a few expected milestones for future studies.",

            "text": "Small Solar System Bodies (SSSBs) correspond to a class of Solar System objects, all orbiting around the Sun, that are smaller than dwarf planets and are likely not internally differentiated. With the exception of active comets-that have bright and large comas-the SSSBs appeared stellar-like (not resolved) in the nineteenth century telescopes, thus explaining the origin of the 'asteroid' designation. This naming and classification has evolved with time, between minor planet and asteroid designation, to end up in 2006, with the definition of the SSSB class, following an IAU resolution (van der Hucht 2008). So, Small Solar System Bodies currently include most of the asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and comets. SSSBs are hence found in different regions of the Solar System: near Earth objects (NEOs) orbiting in the vicinity of the Earth (with perihelion q \u2264 1.3 AU), main-belt asteroids (MBAs) orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, Trojan asteroids co-orbiting Jupiter or other major planets, Centaurs orbiting between Jupiter and Neptune, and in the belt of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) beyond the orbit of Neptune (with semi-major axis a \u2265 30 AU). Additionally, and because they share some properties with these small bodies, we shall also consider in the rest of the paper some small planetary satellites (orbiting around a planet, and hence not strictly speaking SSSBs).\n\nThese small icy or rocky bodies are of particular interest for fundamental scientific research to understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems in general, and of our Solar System in particular. SSSBs, being pristine in general, or having experienced little geological evolution, are valuable tracers of the early time of the Solar System. Asteroids, comets and planetesimals are also believed to be the source of water on Earth through past collisions (Morbidelli et al. 2000;O'Brien et al. 2014;Bancelin et al. 2017, and references therein) and so they have been proposed to be the fundamental bricks that formed an environment apt to support life on Earth. Space missions are of great value to deepen our understanding of SSSBs, as will be seen in Sect. 2. Following the success of the Hayabusa space mission that visited",

            "text": "With the intent to support this finding we now need to address to other approach. As known, the dwarf planet Ceres is similar to the trans-Neptunian dwarf planets (TNDPs) on own orbital parameters (large eccentricities and inclinations) and thus it may be proposed an escaped satellite similarly these TNDPs treated as former satellites of Neptune (Rogozin 2012) that could be the newcomer in the Solar System (Sumi et al 2011). Based on this, Ceres appears may have some common with them the regularities. Specifically, we find the empirical rule for inclinations of TNDPs i in such form: \n\nwhere R n and R N are semi-major axes respectively of n-th TNDP and Neptune, \u03c0 (=3.1416) and \u03b8 (=2.1390) are the mathematical constants with introduced here new constant \u03b8, which fit before unknown the mathematical identity \u03c0 \u03a6 \u03b8 = 4 e. Here, \u03a6 (=1.6180) and e (=2.7183) are known mathematical constants. In view of 1 rad = 57.29578 0 coefficient \u03b8/2\u03c0 = 19.5 0 . Starting from foregoing our assumptions we admit the application of equation ( 1) to find the presently unknown orbital characteristics of Ceres\u02bc host (that we named Yurus). As an illustration, we used TNDPs Eris, Haumea, and Makemake, for which from this equation follows computed values i equal respectively 43.88 0 , 28.10 0 , and 29.69 0 versus observed values respectively 44.19 0 , 28.22 0 , and 28.96 0 . Now, using the present orbital data of Ceres i = 10.586 0 and R n = 2.765979 AU (according to www. johnstonsarchive.net) from (1) follows the semi-major axis of Yurus should be 5.0951 AU, i.e. practically coincide with foregoing value R n . This identity of the results derived from two different methods appears confirm our hypothesis on the origin Ceres in colder region of the Solar System.",

            "text": "2.1. Method In order to estimate the possible radius and intrinsic luminosity of Planet Nine we have run Neptune-like thermal evolution models, where we varied several structure parameters around those appropriate for Neptune. These models are somewhat similar to those of Linder & Mordasini (2016), although we make different choices about particular compositions to investigate. Here we assume planet masses between 5 and 50 M \u2295 (M Nep = 17.15 M \u2295 ) and two compositionally different layers consisting of a H/He envelope atop a core that is either ice-rich (2 : 1 ice : rock) or ice-poor (1 : 4 ice : rock). We varied the core mass fraction within 0.1-0.3 for the most massive models, representing a sub-Saturn mass gas giant, 0.30-0.84 for a 15M \u2295 series of models, and 0.6-0.9 for the least massive models of 5-8 M \u2295 , representing a sub-Neptune. For reference, constraints from Neptune suggest \u223c 0.76-0.90 ice/rock by mass (Helled et al. 2011;Nettelmann et al. 2013), and detailed modeling suggests a iceenriched H/He envelope atop very ice/rock rich deep interior (Hubbard et al. 1995;Helled et al. 2011;Nettelmann et al. 2013). Like Nettelmann et al. (2013) we represent the warm fluid ices in the interior by the water equation of state (EOS) H 2 O-REOS.1, H/He the updated H/He-REOS.3 tables of Becker et al. (2014), and for the rock EOS Hubbard & Marley (1989). \n\nWe followed the thermal evolution of Planet Nine at 1000 AU, corresponding to a zero-albedo equilibrium temperature of 9 K. We explored a range of incident fluxes but found that is yielded little impact on the thermal evolution.",

            "text": "According to our new understanding the evolution of the Solar System was characterized by three main \"eras\": In the gas-disk era, the giant planets acquired a multi-resonant configuration, in which each planet was in a mean-motion resonance with its neighbor. Given the Jupiter/Saturn mass-ratio, this prevented further inward migration, and explains why Jupiter was not closer than 5 AU from the Sun at the disappearance of the gas. It is possible that the giant planets had an inward-then-outward migration, bringing Jupiter temporarily at \u223c 1.5 AU (Walsh et al., 2010). At the disappearance of the gas, the system entered in the planetesimal-disk era. The orbits of the giant planets were at the time much closer to each other than they are now, and had significantly -23smaller eccentricities and inclinations. A massive disk of planetesimals persisted outside the orbit of the outermost giant planet. The gravitational interactions between the giant planets and this disk, slowly modified the resonant orbit of the former. Eventually, \u223c 600 My later, the giant planets became unstable, as a result of these slow orbital modifications. The chaotic phase that followed reshuffled the structure of the outer Solar System: the giant planets acquired their current orbits; most of the distant planetesimal disk was dispersed, causing the Late Heavy Bombardment of the terrestrial planets; a small fraction of the distant planetesimals got stranded in what we call today the Kuiper belt. With this profound re-organization, the Solar System entered into the current era, lasting since \u223c 3.8 Gy ago, in which it did not suffer any further significant change. This is a radically different view with respect to the one that was consensual even just 10 years ago. However, it has a level of internal coherence and a consistency with the observed structure of the Solar System that have never been achieved before. This model describes a Solar System evolving under the same two main processes usually invoked to explain the structure of extra-solar planetary systems: radial migration in the gas-disk and global orbital instability.",

To save computation time the terrestrial planets were not included, as their effects are negligible. For each simulation, we initialize Planet Nine at 40 AU. The \u03c4 a parameter, as seen in Kostov et al. (2016), parameterizes the rate of change in the system. The evolution of Planet Nine's semi-major axis is given by a = a 0 e t/\u03c4a , ( \n\nIn practice, perturbative influences from the other planets lead to slightly more complex realized semi-major axis evolution and hence a non-deterministic final a. We set \u03c4 a = 4 \u00d7 10 7 years for each of our simulations -for this value, the semi-major axis progresses through 2.5 e-folding timescales. We emphasize that our choice of initial a and \u03c4 a do not reflect Planet Nine's true initial position or migratory trajectory -recall that Planet Nine is believed to have originated with the giant planets. Rather, the value of 40 AU is picked to encapsulate as much of the evolutionary trajectory as possible, without sacrificing the stability of the simulation. As the effect of Planet Nine on the Uranian \u2126 only increases for smaller semi-major axis (per secular theory), bringing Planet Nine's initial position closer in would serve to bring the ratio \u03b1/g down, which favors resonant capture. Therefore, in principle any smaller initial a 9 and any \u03c4 a satisfying the adiabatic criterion should yield similar or larger obliquities than our simulations. We also emphasize that the given migration scheme does not represent the most accurate physical evolutionary pathway of Planet 9's semimajor axis. In reality, Planet 9's outward migration was likely not smooth and its expansion rate likely decreased with time. We will discuss a more realistic migration scheme in Section 5.4 -for now, the simple exponential model of semimajor axis growth is selected for ease of use and is sufficient to draw firstorder conclusions, given that as long as the evolution remains within the adiabatic limit the precise evolution of the semimajor axis should not significantly impact the dynamics.",

They rule out Planet Nine positions near perihelion, given by R.A. < 2\u00b0and R.A. > 255\u00b0, that worsen the fit to the Cassini residuals. The orbital position that leads to a maximum improvement of the residuals is located at R.A.\uf0a0\u223c\uf0a030\u00b0and decl.\uf0a0\u223c\uf0a0\u221220\u00b0, which is near our favored region. Holman & Payne (2016b) used a dynamical model of the tidal influence of Planet Nine to fit the Cassini ranging data. They significantly rule out large areas of the sky and find a most favored location of R.A.\uf0a0\u223c\uf0a040\u00b0and decl.\uf0a0\u223c\uf0a0\u221215\u00b0, extending \u223c20\u00b0in all directions. Although these results depend sensitively on the assumed solar system model (Folkner et al. 2016), it is perhaps worth noting that the region correlates well with the highest density of favored points in Figure 13.\n\nThe sparseness of the resonant configurations in Figure 13 is a reflection of the computational infeasibility of using N-body integrations alone to pinpoint the perturber parameters that allow multiple KBOs to coexist in resonance. If the resonant hypothesis is correct, an optimization scheme that more heavily exploits the MMRs will effectively constrain Planet Nine's orbital elements and sky position. Specifically, we are interested in converging upon the parameters that allow all KBOs to exhibit long-lasting resonant libration simultaneously. This will require not just orbital integrations but also a better dynamical understanding of how these high-eccentricity resonances are arranged in phase-space.",

            "text": "One important feature of our Solar System is that it has produced a substantial number of planets, including giant gaseous planets in the outer regions and rocky terrestrial planets further inward. Although observations of extra-solar planetary systems indicate that giant planets are not rare, planet formation is not guaranteed. Current data suggest that about 10 percent of solar-type stars harbor giant planets with semi-major axes in the range a = 0.02 -5 AU (Cummings et al. 2008). Since the observational sample is not complete, especially for planets with longer periods, the fraction of solar-type stars with giant planets is even larger. After extrapolating the data to include the full range of periods, the fraction of systems with giant planets is estimated to be about 20 percent (although larger fractions, perhaps up to 50 percent, remain possible).\n\nAt this time, detection of planets with masses comparable to Earth is just out of reach for main-sequence stars (due to technical limitations). As a result, it is too early to assess the odds of solar systems having terrestrial planets. However, a number of considerations suggest that such planets can be made relatively easily: We first note that terrestrial mass planets have been detected in orbit about pulsars (Wolszczan 1994). In addition, our Solar System has readily produced not only four terrestrial planets, but a large collection of moons, asteroids, dwarf planets, and comets. Data from extrasolar planets show that the planetary mass function increases toward lower masses. These findings argue that the formation of terrestrial planets should be common (and hence that our Solar System is not rare in this regard).\n\nOne of the most remarkable features of our Solar System is that the planetary orbits are well-ordered. More specifically, all of the planetary orbits are nearly in the same plane, with inclination angles in the narrow range (\u2206i) \u2264 3.5 \u2022 . Another measure of order is the low orbital eccentricities, which lie in the range 0 \u2264 e \u2264 0.2. If Mercury is excluded, the next largest eccentricity is that of Mars at e \u2248 0.09. As discussed below, orbital eccentricities and inclination angles are relatively easy to excite by passing stars and other dynamical perturbations. As a result, the currently observed order of the Solar System provides powerful constraints on its history.\n\nOn a related note",

We choose this minimum number of planets as a compromise between, on the one hand, having enough systems to analyze without suffering too badly from small number statistics, and on the other hand, having enough planets in each system to fit 2 parameters and minimize incompleteness of the systems. \n\nAs of 17 July 2013, online exoplanet archives 2 Seven of the 68 systems were detected by the radial velocity method; Gl 876, mu Ara, ups And, 55 Cnc, Gl 581, HD 40307 and HD 10180. One system, HR 8799, was detected by direct imaging. The remaining 60 are candidate systems detected by the Kepler mission. Four of the Kepler systems have been confirmed by radial velocity observations . The remaining 56 Kepler detected systems consist of planet candidates. However, Lissauer et al. (2012) conclude that < 2% of Kepler candidates in multiple planet systems are likely to be false positives. \n\nSince the jostling during planetary system formation is a messy process that can include planetary scattering and migration, we expect varying degrees of adherence to the TB relation. Previous TB relation studies of exoplanetary systems (Poveda & Lara 2008;Cuntz 2011) chose where to propose additional planets based on the solution which minimizes \u03c7 2 /dof. If our Solar System is treated like an exosystem, where limited detection sensitivity precludes the detection of some planets, this method does not necessarily recover the complete Solar System. We use the Solar System as a guide to how well we expect exosystems to adhere to the TB relation. In log space, the period form of the generalized TB relation (Equation 2) is given by log \n\nwhere A and B are parameters being fit to each system. The \u03c7 2 /dof value for a system containing N planets can then be calculated by \n\nwhere \u03c3 n is the unknown uncertainty associated with the various reasons that the log of the period of the nth planet does not conform to the TB relation.",

            "text": "The outermost planet, TRAPPIST-1h, has a mass of only M = 0.086 \u00b1 0.084M \u2295 , and a radius of 0.715R \u2295 (Wang et al. 2017). Given our assumed densities of rock and ice, TRAPPIST-1h, with a mean density \u03c1 = 1299 kg/m 3 , should contain only H 2 O, and no rock or metal. \n\nAlthough it was permitted in the context of our assumptions, we thought it unlikely that TRAPPIST-1h would be composed of pure water ice. The vast majority of ice-rich bodies in the outer solar system contain some fraction of rock (one possible exception being Saturn's small moon Tethys, which may not be primordial (Salmon and Canup 2017)). In our solar system, almost all of the outer planet satellites and dwarf planets contain some rock, and from a formation standpoint, it seems unlikely that TRAPPIST-1h is completely devoid of rock. For this reason we determined interior structures using a low-density mineral assemblage commonly used as a proxy for the rocky component of outer Solar System satellites: Prinn-Fegley rock, for the planet, and a planetary mean density of 1300 kg/m 3 . \n\nWe found that a model TRAPPIST-1h with a density \u03c1mean could harbor a core of rock 1030 km in radius, with the remainder of the planet composed of H 2 O in various phases (see right panel in the last row of Fig. 3). If TRAPPIST-1h had a density close to its maximum permitted value, \u03c1max = 3149 kg/m 3 , it could be composed of almost pure rock, with only \u223c 100 km of H 2 O near the surface (see left panel in the last row of Fig. 3). With its low effective surface temperature, T eff = 169 K (Gillon et al. 2017), planet h undoubtedly has a solid ice surface. Similar to our null result for TRAPPIST-1g, we were not able to determine an equilibrium temperature dictated by the balance of tidal heat generation and transport in TRAPPIST-1h.",

            "text": "The Laplace-Lagrange theory assumes constant semimajor axes for all planets, and additionally fails in the limit of significant short-period terms (Camargo et al. 2018), so a migrating Planet Nine cannot be modelled in this framework. We instead turn to full N-body integrations that employ the REBOUND package with the adaptive high-order IAS15 integrator (Rein & Spiegel 2015). We incorporated orbit-averaged physical forces to simulate the outward migration of Planet Nine using the modify orbits forces implementation (Kostov et al. 2016) in the REBOUNDx package (Tamayo et al. 2019). \n\nAn overview of our modeling procedure is as follows. A REBOUND simulation is initialized with the Sun and the four outer planets in their present-day configuration, with orbital element values from the NASA HORIZONS database. Planet Nine is then initialized in its starting position. Free parameters associated with Planet Nine include its mass, its eccentricity, and its inclination. We set the initial semi-major axis and \u03c4 a (which parameterizes the migration rate as seen in Kostov et al. (2016)) constant. The system as thus specified is in the frame of the ecliptic. We then determine the invariant plane of the Solar System with Planet Nine accounted for, via the method outlined by Souami & Souchay (2012). The normal vector to the invariant plane is \n\nwhere m j , r j , v j are the mass, barycentric position, and barycentric velocity of the jth body, respectively. We recalculate the inclination of each planet in the invariant frame by taking the angle between Ltot and the planet's own orbital angular momentum vector. Each simulation is then integrated forward for 10 8 years. The results of the REBOUND simulation (namely, values for the Uranian inclination, eccentricity, \u2126, and ) are used to construct time evolutions of the orbital elements e(t), p(t), q(t). The orbital elements at each timestep are then passed into the spin axis equation of motion (eq. 10) to track the motion of the spin axis.",

The Sun and planets' masses, initial positions, and velocities are adopted from DE405 with epoch 1969 June 28 (Standish 1998). \n\nTo be consistent with the ephemeris of minor planets in the ASTORB file, we transformed the positions and velocities of the Sun and planets from the mean equatorial system to the J2000.0 ecliptic system, and then numerically integrated their orbits to the epoch 2016 November 8. At this point, the absolute value of the total angular momentum of the Sun-planets system is computed to be |H S &p | = 3.1333 \u00d7 10 50 g \u2022 cm 2 \u2022 s \u22121 , which agrees well with the previously published results (Dai 1977;Wesson 1984;Weissman 1991). \n\nFig. 1.

The case of N = 0 indicates that all the known minor planets have been taken into account. After ruling out the contamination of the three dwarf planets Eris, Pluto, and Haumea (i.e., N = 3), \u03b1 drops sharply and then maintains a very small value as N continues to increase. \n\nNext, for each of the four minor planet groups, we separately calculated the overall angular momentum analogous to Eq.

We know the atmospheric composition of at least one giant planet in the Solar System. 20 We have a good understanding of the telluric planets, maybe not Mercury, which is not very well-known. Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, (ma671@cam.ac.uk). \n\nI think discoveries of exoplanets don't challenge our understanding of the Solar System, but tell us that this picture is one amongst many possibilities to form planets. \n\nWe have expanded our understanding of planetary system models by adding lots of ingredients. One of them is the fact that the planet can, in a way, move during the early stage a lot more than we thought. A planet can form at a certain location and then can move towards its star. 5][26] Due to this interaction, planets can move outwards or inwards in the planetary system. In this case, it becomes difficult getting a clear understanding of how to connect the end product to the initial stage of a planetary system evolution, because so many things can happen. Right now we are trying to retrieve as much data as we can from many planets in order to go back in time to reconstruct all the steps of planetary systems evolution. \n\n8][29] This can tell us part of the story on the origin of the chemical constituents of a planet, whether they have been accreted by the planet or built-up in the planet. \n\nThis means that it's not enough to detect them, get the mass, and the size. We really want to know more about the atmosphere of these planets as we've been doing in the Solar System when we studied the atmosphere of the giant planets. 1][32] This is known as the formation mechanism of giant planets beyond the ice line, [33][34][35] where by ice we indicate not only water but also any other gas that can solidify.",

            "text": ". It is not clear, for example, whether most of its members are properly described as \"super-Earths\" or \"sub-Neptunes\" or something else entirely. Curiously, our own Solar System, which contains nothing interior to Mercury's 88-day orbit, lacks any of the larger and closer-in planets that dominate this part of the exoplanet diagram; how common terrestrial planet configurations similar to our Solar System are is unknown, although many stars clearly host different and easier-to-detect systems of ungiants. Fig. 3.-Mass-Radius diagram for Extrasolar planets. This figure shows planets for which both mass and radius estimates exist, with orbital period coded to run from one day (blue) through 100 days (red). Three sample mass-radius relations are shown. The short-dotted line is drawn from a simple in-situ formation theory as described in Chiang & Laughlin (2013), and is based on rock-iron planets surrounded by hydrogen-helium envelopes, and does not include the possible effects of insolation-driven atmospheric mass loss. The long-dashed line is the best-fit M P /M \u2295 = (R p /R \u2295 ) 2.06 power-law appropriate to the Solar System planets spanning masses from Earth through Saturn. The medium-dashed line is the 3M P /M \u2295 = R p /R \u2295 relation derived by Lithwick et al. (2012) from consideration of the transit timing variations observed by Kepler for 22 multiply-transiting candidate planet pairs in the vicinity of mean motion resonances.\n\nA confounding factor is presented by the difficulty in obtaining precise Doppler radial velocity-based or transit timing-based mass estimates for super-Earth/sub-Neptune class planets. Figure 3 charts a selection of planets for which both mass and radius (and hence density) measurements have been made. Even with the log-log scaling, the plot indicates to the eye that planets are subject to a wide variety of structures. For example, to within the errors, it appears that plants of M \u223c 6 M \u2295 vary in radii by a factor of at least three. When mass is viewed as a function of radius, the transition in composition appears sharper, with planets R p 2 R \u2295 generally not dominated by rock (including iron)",

            "text": "1. INTRODUCTION Ever since the International Astronomical Union (IAU) modified the status of Pluto to that of a \"dwarf planet\" from its initial designation as one of nine planets in the Solar system, 1 the Solar system is held to comprise eight known planets currently. The debate of what exactly constitutes a \"planet\" is still ongoing (e.g., Metzger et al. 2022), although many scientists adhere to the taxonomic classification propounded by the IAU. After Pluto's status was updated, the hunt for an elusive \"Planet Nine\" far beyond the orbit of Pluto -alternatively known as \"Planet X\" -has accordingly intensified, although it must be recognized that this endeavor long predates the aforementioned IAU decision. A historical overview of this field can be found in the recent publication by Batygin et al. (2019). The most crucial modern development in this realm arguably concerns the work of Batygin & Brown (2016a): the authors theo-1 https://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto/ rized that the (ostensibly) improbable orbital clustering of certain Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) is strikingly explainable through the existence of a distant planet with mass \u223c 10 M \u2295 on an eccentric orbit. Earlier notable developments in the twenty-first century relating to Planet 9 are reported in de La Fuente Marcos & de La Fuente Marcos (2014), Trujillo & Sheppard (2014), and Gomes et al. (2015), among other papers. \n\nThis noteworthy proposal by Batygin & Brown (2016a) initiated a plethora of publications centered on myriad aspects of the putative Planet 9.",

            "text": "Next we apply the results of this analysis to the moons of our own Solar System. Here we consider the 16 largest moons of the Solar System. 1 These bodies orbit Earth (our moon), Pluto (Charon), and the four giant planets. For a given moon mass \u00b5 and planetary mass m, we calculate the mass parameter \u03b4 = \u00b5/m 1/3 , where the masses have been scaled by the mass of Sun. The solution to equation ( 79) then determines the location of the stable tidal equilibrium point for the moon in terms of the ratio b/(am 1/3 ). This orbital ratio can then be compared to those of observed moons. \n\nFigure 4 shows the observed values (red points) of the scaled orbital ratio as a function of the mass parameter \u03b4 for the largest moons in our Solar System. The dashed magenta line shows the location where the moons would orbit at half their Hill radius. Numerical simulations (Payne et al. 2013) indicate that moons with larger orbits (above the magenta line) are susceptible to being dynamically removed from their host planets, so that we do not expect any points to fall above this line. For comparison, the solid blue curve shows the value of the orbital ratio corresponding to the stable tidal equilibrium point (from Section 3). Note that the curve is nearly constant, as expected for the small values of \u03b4 realized within the Solar System. More importantly, the tidal equilibrium point (solid blue curve) lies outside the stability boundary (dashed magenta line). This ordering implies that the conditions for a stable tidal equilibrium state are at odds with the requirement for dynamical stability indicated by numerical simulations. \n\nIn Figure 4, the point with the largest mass parameter \u03b4 and the largest orbital ratio (in the upper right part of the diagram) corresponds to our Moon. The other point that stands out in the figure is the relatively large orbital ratio for the moon Iapetus, which orbits Saturn. Except our Moon, Iapetus orbits farther from its host planet than other (large) moons in our system. With the exception of the Pluto-Charon system, all of the moons have orbital periods that are larger than the planetary rotation periods. Because the planets are spinning faster, tidal forces on the moons are expected to move them outward toward instability (upward in Figure 4).",

            "text": ".\n\nAnother population of objects that Planet Nine naturally generates is the highly inclined component of the proximate (a 100 au < ) Kuiper Belt. This subset of bodies includes all objects with i 35 deg \uf089 that do not naturally emerge from simulations of the solar system's primordial evolution (Levison et al. 2008;Batygin et al. 2011;Nesvorn\u00fd 2015) and include the retrograde objects \"Drac\" (Gladman et al. 2009) and \"Niku\" (Chen et al. 2016). Although these objects appear observationally distinct from the nearly perpendicular high semimajor axis centaurs discussed above, full-fledged N-body simulations reported in Batygin & Brown (2016b) show that the highly inclined a 100 au < objects are simply the large-a objects that have been scattered inwards by Neptune. As a consequence, they do not require a separate dynamical explanation from the objects undergoing the large-scale orbital excursions discussed in Section 5.2 of this paper.\n\nCumulatively, the aforementioned lines of evidence constitute a compelling case for the existence of Planet Nine, as none of the objects within the current observational data set exert any significant tension upon the model. In light of this broad-ranging agreement (short of a direct detection of Planet Nine), the most direct avenue toward further reinforcement or falsification of our theory is the continued detection of a 250 au \uf089 KBOs with the aim to better establish the statistical significance of the clustering of longitudes of perihelion and ascending node (Brown 2017;Shankman et al. 2017). To this end, we reiterate that even though the contamination of the clustered orbital pattern by unconfined particles is an expected result of P9\u02bcs gravitational influence, a notable grouping of long-period trajectories in physical space remains a key feature of the dynamical model.\n\nAlthough the evidence for P9 remains strong, as already discussed in the introduction, a simple proposition of an extant planet beyond Neptune does not amount to a meaningful theoretical prediction. Instead, the Planet Nine hypothesis is uniquely defined by the combination of observational signatures it explains and the specific dynamical mechanisms through which these astronomical patterns arise. Thus, the final evaluation of the Planet Nine hypothesis will not simply correspond to a detection of a planet",

The outer solar system still harbors surprises and mysteries.

A number of scenarios for the formation of ESDOs, including additional planets in the outer solar system, have been proposed. Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) noted a peculiar clustering of the ESDOs: they all have arguments of perihelion, \u03c9, near zero. This does not result from known observational biases\uf0a0(de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2014; Gomes et al. 2015).

Until a couple of decades ago, the detailed investigation of the planetary properties was restricted to objects orbiting inside the Kuiper Belt. Today, we cannot ignore that the number of known planets has increased by two orders of magnitude nor that these planets resemble anything but the objects present in our own Solar System. Whether this fact is the result of a selection bias induced by the kind of techniques used to discover new planets\u2014mainly radial velocity and transit\u2014or simply the proof that the Solar System is a rarity in the Milky Way, we do not know yet. What is clear, though, is that the Solar System has failed to be the paradigm not only in our Galaxy but even \u2018just\u2019 in the solar neighbourhood. This finding, although unsettling, forces us to reconsider our knowledge of planets under a different light and perhaps question a few of the theoretical pillars on which we base our current \u2018understanding\u2019. The next decade will be critical to advance in what we should perhaps call Galactic planetary science. In this paper, I review highlights and pitfalls of our current knowledge of this topic and elaborate on how this knowledge might arguably evolve in the next decade. More critically, I identify what should be the mandatory scientific and technical steps to be taken in this fascinating journey of remote exploration of planets in our Galaxy.",

            "text": "This classification framework may be revised or extended in the future in a number of ways. For example, the precise definition of the divide between inner and outer planets can be modified. This definition can evolve as planetary searches are extended to include planetary orbits with larger periods (and hence more outer planets). In addition, specific parts of the parameter space could, in the future, provide evidence of new categories of planetary systems. Future microlensing surveys, such as that planned for the Roman Space Telescope, should prove especially useful for filling in these blank corners of the map (R. F. Wilson et al. 2023). On another front, the present data do not address binary star systems separately, nor do they include Trojan planets or exomoons; the future discovery of such bodies could necessitate additional categories in the classification scheme. \n\nOur own solar system, viewed through the lens of the four planets that would likely be detected with current methods (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn), shows clearly distinguished inner and outer planets, 9 but it lacks the three (visible) inner planets that would be needed to definitively classify it. When all eight planets are included, our solar system has a closely spaced peas-in-a-pod inner system, typical of the large majority (80%) of N 3 inner systems, albeit with somewhat less uniformity of planet size than average. 10 The \"unusually long\" periods of the inner planets would plausibly only appear so because of observational selection effects. Uranus and Neptune do represent non-Jovian outer planets, which do not appear in the current exoplanet catalog, but these may also prove to be common with improved detection techniques. Taken together, the results from this classification scheme indicate that while our solar system is somewhat less well ordered than the mean, it is much less exotic than is often claimed. \n\nOne important related issue is that sufficiently small planets, comparable to the mass and size of Mars, can easily escape detection with our current observational capabilities. As a result, relatively small, Mars-sized planets could be hiding within observed multiplanet systems, for example in the innerouter divide.",

The internal structure of the asteroid belt and the small mass of Mars constrain the formation of Jupiter and the disappearance of the protosolar nebula (e.g., Walsh et al. 2011;Izidoro et al. 2014;Brasser et al. 2016;Bromley & Kenyon 2017;Clement et al. 2019). Different classes of Kuiper Belt objects just beyond the orbit of Neptune hold traces of the early orbital evolution of the gas giant planets (e.g., Malhotra 1993;Ida et al. 2000;Levison & Morbidelli 2003;Gomes et al. 2004;Tsiganis et al. 2005;Dawson & Murray-Clay 2012;Holman et al. 2018). Sedna and other transneptunian objects may point to a ninth planet orbiting the Sun at distances more than 10 times beyond the orbit of Neptune (Trujillo & Sheppard 2014;, 2019Sheppard & Trujillo 2016;Becker et al. 2018;Sheppard et al. 2019).\n\nThe binary dwarf planet Pluto-Charon illustrates the chaotic early history of the solar system (McKinnon 1989;Canup 2005Canup , 2011Walsh & Levison 2015;McKinnon et al. 2017;Quillen et al. 2017;Stern et al. 2018;Woo & Lee 2018). In current theory, Pluto and Charon form in separate locations outside the orbits of the gas giants. Charon then suffers a glancing collision with Pluto and remains bound. Icy debris from the collision coalesces into the small satellites. Because the debris is mostly ice, the density of the satellites should be smaller than the density of either Pluto or Charon. Current observational limits on the satellite masses and mass densities are poor (Weaver et al. 2016).\n\nHere, we place better limits on the satellite masses with a suite of \u223c4000 n-body calculations. Together with measured sizes from the New Horizons mission, we then derive the mass density and test the formation theories. Along with the high measured albedos from New Horizons, the new estimates of the mass density support theoretical models where the satellites form in icy material left over from the collision of Charon with Pluto",

There are some celestial bodies which are rotate around the planets as moons. Some of the moons are large and some of them are very small. History of the moons has started by thinking and studying of humankind on our moon. Dawn of this history goes back to myths. Brightness and motion of the moon inspired wonder and weirdness. In Greek Mythology, Selene is the goddess of the moon; she was the driver of her chariot in the heavens [1]. But in Greek science, the scientific perspective of moon has been improved and in the middle centuries which were after the invention of telescope, it has been cleared that the moon is sphere. Furthermore, after discovering the moons of Jupiter by Galileo, it has been believed that moon is not the only celestial object that rotates around a planet [2]. Nowadays the number of the discovered moon is more than 180 [3]. The distribution of the moons in solar system may obey some rules. In the region of soil planet (Earth, Venus, Mars, Mercury) there are only three moons, and just one of them is large (the Earth's moon) while in the region of gaseous planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Plato) the number of moons is huge. The giant gaseous planets are in the outer part of solar system and most of the moons rotate around them. The size of some of the moons is comparable to the size of our moon (Lunar) but other moons are small and they made of rocky materials. Obviously in the outer region of the solar system, the bigger planets have more moons, because the sources of most of the moons are Kuiper belt and Oort cloud. After leaving these regions the moons have been absorbed by gravitational force of the planets. On the other hand, the large size moons have other sources. For example the moon of the earth separated from the earth when a collision occurred between the earth and a celestial body [4,5]. \n\nIn this study we first explain the most important moons in solar system and then their distribution in solar system in another section.",

We use a Monte Carlo suite of numerical N-body integrations to construct a variety of orbital elements of the new planet and evaluate the dynamical stability of eight trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in the presence of Planet Nine. These simulations show that some combinations of orbital elements ( ) result in Planet Nine acting as a stabilizing influence on the TNOs, which can otherwise be destabilized by interactions with Neptune. These simulations also suggest that some TNOs transition between several different mean-motion resonances during their lifetimes while still retaining approximate apsidal antialignment with Planet Nine. This behavior suggests that remaining in one particular orbit is not a requirement for orbital stability. As one product of our simulations, we present an a posteriori probability distribution for the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the proposed Planet Nine based on TNO stability. This result thus provides additional evidence that supports the existence of this proposed planet. We also predict that TNOs can be grouped into multiple populations of objects that interact with Planet Nine in different ways: one population may contain objects like Sedna and 2012 VP113, which do not migrate significantly in semimajor axis in the presence of Planet Nine and tend to stay in the same resonance; another population may contain objects like 2007 TG422 and 2013 RF98, which may both migrate and transition between different resonances.",

With an improved understanding of the formation of the Solar System, the only known inhabited planetary system, and also the processes that form and shape exoplanetary systems, we are getting closer to understanding how a habitable planetary system forms.\n\nIt is beginning to look like some of the same mechanisms proposed to account for the observed trends among exoplanets also operated in the Solar System, albeit to a somewhat lesser degree. Since the Solar System remains the only system for which we have a complete census of the planets and a very rich census of its small bodies, it is a uniquely important source of the kind of data needed to constrain planet formation and evolution models.\n\nThe standard historical \"nebular\" model of the formation of the Solar System begins with the early Sun surrounded by a protoplanetary gas and dust disk, having gravitationally collapsed within a much larger interstellar molecular cloud [118]. Within this picture, the solids began condensing as small grains that coalesced to form larger solids, accumulating in the disk mid-plane. Initially, most of the mass in the disk consisted of H and He and various volatile compounds, such as water vapor and carbon monoxide. The temperature and surface mass density of the disk both decline with increasing distance from the central Sun. A very important concept is the \"snow\" or \"frost\" line, beyond which volatiles (mostly water) condensed and remained in the solid state (as ices). In the early Solar System, the snow line was between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Within the context of the core accretion gas-capture model [119,120], the dichotomy between the terrestrial and Jovian planets is easily explained. Jupiter formed just beyond the snow line, where the surface density of solids, mostly ices, was greatest, while the terrestrial planets formed within the snow line where solids consisted of the far less abundant refractory materials; simulations show that the terrestrial planets could have formed from a narrow annulus of material between 0.7 and 1.0 AU from the Sun [121].

            "text": "As explained by M09 and also R09, the solar abundance anomaly (i.e., the deficiency of refractory elements relative to volatiles in the Sun as compared to solar twins) can be interpreted as a signature of the formation of planets, and perhaps more specifically terrestrial planets, in the solar system. They speculate that the accretion of chemically fractionated material into the solar convective envelope during the formation of the solar system made its chemical composition pattern depleted in refractories as these elements were retained by the planets. The fact that the total mass of refractories in the terrestrial planets of the solar system today is of the same order of magnitude as the mean observed difference between refractories and volatiles in the Sun relative to solar twins supports the hypothesis of a terrestrial planet signature, as well as the observed abundance pattern of meteorites, which mirrors the solar abundance anomaly (Alexander et al. 2001;Ciesla 2008). \n\nFig. 3 shows that the abundance ratios are a roughly linear increasing function of condensation temperature for T C 900 K but they become nearly constant for T C 900 K. This suggests that the process responsible for the observed trend affects only elements with T C 900 K. 4 These high temperatures are only found in the inner parts ( 2 AU) of protoplanetary disks, regions which, at least in the solar system, are inhabited by terrestrial planets. Moreover, M09 analyzed the abundance vs. T C trends of about 10 solar analogs with and without detected giant gas planets. They found that those stars hosting hot Jupiters all behave like the majority of solar twin stars, i.e., they have a chemical composition slightly different from solar. More striking is the fact that the fraction of stars which closely resemble the Sun in their chemical composition is about 70 % if the star does not have a close-in giant planet. Within our interpretation of the T C trend as a planet signature, we are led to conclude that the presence of hot Jupiters prevents the formation of terrestrial planets. One could also speculate that in those systems, the smaller planets have already been accreted by the host star, thus removing the initially imprinted abundance signature. 2 and 3.",

The effect of material strength in the planets' shapes is not taken into account in these calculations.\n\nLooking to the solar system bodies for inspiration, we see that once bodies are roughly 200 km (for icy materials) to 300 km (for rocky materials) in radius, their self-gravity is sufficient to overcome their material strength and they achieve a rounded shape. Iapetus (mean radius 734.5 \u00b1 2.8 km, Roatsch et al. 2009) is the largest solar system body measured to have significant deviations from a hydrostatic equilibrium shape (Thomas 2010). Since KOI 1843.03 is about 4000 km in radius, it is safely in the regime where self-gravity dominates the material forces and hydrostatic equilibrium determines its leading-order shape, satisfying the minimum mass criterion in the IAU definition of a planet.\n\nTo leading order, Earth-mass scale planets (such as KOI 1843.03, K2 137b, K2 229b, and K2 106b) are in hydrostatic equilibrium, with rigidity representing a minor correction. In our models, the central pressures of KOI 1843.03 are on the order of 10 11 -10 12 \uf0a0Pa, which is orders of magnitude larger than the shear strength of iron (Clatterbuck et al. 2003) and peridotite (Handy et al. 1999).\n\nThe high instellations of USP planets can lead to molten surfaces (e.g., L\u00e9ger et al. 2011;Kite et al. 2016 K assuming a basalt-like planet surface albedo \u03b1\uf0a0=\uf0a00.1 (e.g., Kite et al. 2016). This temperature is sufficiently hot to melt metallic iron (melting point 1811 K) and is hotter than the liquidus of peridotite (Takahashi 1986), the dominant rock in Earth's upper mantle. Thus, the planet's surface would have too little strength to sustain a topography that could significantly influence the transit depth.\n\nIn using the Roche limit to constrain the bulk compositions of KOI 1843.03 and K2 137b, we have followed Rappaport et al.

            "text": "The K2-19 system offers a sharp contrast to the architecture and physical properties of the solar system planets. In the solar system, not a single planet resides interior to Mercury (P = 88 days), while for K2-19 there are (at least) three planets with P\uf0a0<\uf0a012 days. K2-19 c straddles a gap in the size distribution of solar system planets between the ice giants and Jovians. Finally, no pair of major solar system planets resides so close to mean-motion resonance, although numerous Kuiper Belt objects are in resonance with Neptune, of which Pluto is the prototypical example. 20 As a corollary, we note that orbits which originate in resonance can be driven out of exact commensurability while maintaining liberation of resonant angles by long-term energy dissipation Batygin & Morbidelli 2013b). This scenario, however is only relevant to systems with vanishingly low eccentricities and period ratios well outside of the nominal resonance width, both of which are not satisfied in K2-19.\n\nThe planets orbiting K2-19 are also unusual compared to typical extrasolar planets. Highly irradiated planets between the size of Neptune and Saturn are rare: Petigura et al. (2018b) performed a demographic analysis of GK stars observed by Kepler and found 0.36 planets per 100 stars with R p \uf0a0=\uf0a04-8\uf0a0 \u00c5 R and P\uf0a0<\uf0a010 days. In addition, such proximity to resonance is not a common feature of extrasolar planets; to first order, planet period ratios are uniformly distributed (Lissauer et al. 2011).\n\nMotivated by the unusual characteristics of the K2-19 planets, our team collected RVs with Keck/HIRES and additional photometry from Spitzer and LCO. The RV data set was sufficient to detect the reflex motion due to K2-19b at 7\u03c3. However, the RVs alone were insufficient to detect K2-19 c due to its lower mass. Quasiperiodic RV variability due to spots of \u22487\uf0a0m s \u22121 limited the sensitivity of the RV data set. Spot contrasts are smaller at redder wavelengths, and K2-19 would benefit from RV monitoring in the NIR by instruments such as IRD (Kotani et al. 2018).\n\nThe high precision of the",

While such a \u201cPlanet Nine,\u201d if it exists, is most likely to be discovered via reflected light in the optical, it may emit much more strongly at 3\u22125 \u03bcm than simple blackbody predictions would suggest, depending on its atmospheric properties. As a result, Planet Nine may be detectable at 3.4 \u03bcm with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, but single exposures are too shallow except at relatively small distances ( au). We develop a method to search for Planet Nine far beyond the W1 single-exposure sensitivity, to distances as large as 800 au, using inertial coadds of W1 exposures binned into \u223c1 day intervals. We apply our methodology to a \u223c2000 square degree testbed sky region which overlaps a southern segment of Planet Nine\u2019s anticipated orbital path. We do not detect a plausible Planet Nine candidate, but are able to derive a detailed completeness curve, ruling out its presence within the parameter space searched at W1 < 16.66 (90% completeness). Our method uses all publicly available W1 imaging, spanning 2010 January to 2015 December, and will become more sensitive with future NEOWISE-Reactivation releases of additional W1 exposures. We anticipate that our method will be applicable to the entire high Galactic latitude sky, and we will extend our search to that full footprint in the near future.",

However, with a dynamically favorable realization of Planet Nine, both of these objects can remain dynamically stable for a solar system lifetime. This result, combined with the result from Sheppard & Trujillo (2016) that these two objects are not dynamically stable in the presence of Neptune alone, suggests that Planet Nine can boost the orbital stability of these objects.\n\nVariations between behavior of different TNOs. For each object in our sample, different realizations of Planet Nine lead to differing object lifetimes. This is shown in Figure 2, which plots the lifetime of each TNO as a function of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of Planet Nine. These stability maps look very different for different objects. For example, large-a, low-e orbits lead to a longer lifetime for 2012 VP 113 . For this object, shorter object lifetimes occur if Planet Nine has a shorter perihelion distance (lower a or higher e). This is intuitive. In contrast, 2007 TG 422 is dynamically unstable in the presence of these same long-perihelion-distance objects that 2012 VP 113 preferred. Since different objects prefer different regions of Planet Nine's possible parameter space, a better understanding of the constraints they provide can be obtained by considering all objects simultaneously. We will discuss how this can be done, as well as find constraints using our results thus far, in Section 3.\n\nFate of the TNOs. To construct the lifetime contours in Figure 2, we defined the lifetime of an object as the length of time it lived in our simulation without significant alterations in its orbit. We defined significant alterations in orbit to be any of the following: (1) migration in semimajor axis by more than 100 au from the starting orbit of the object, (2) collisions or a close encounter (defined as passing within 3 Hill radii of the larger body) with Planet Nine or Neptune, (3) collision with the central body, and (4) ejection from the solar system. It is clear that each of these criteria have different thresholds for importance, as well as different outcomes for the object. In particular, while ending methods (2-4)",

            "text": "Our solar system contained the only known planets orbiting a main sequence star until 1995, when a planet was found orbiting the Sun-like star 51 Peg via a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The discovery of more than 150 additional extrasolar planets has overturned our understanding of what constitutes a typical planetary system. The extrasolar planets discovered to date are Jupiter-sized, possess a wide range of orbital eccentricities (0 \u2264 \u01eb \u2264 0.9), and orbit their host stars with small semi-major axes (0.03 AU \u2264 a \u2264 6 AU). In contrast, similarly sized planets in our solar system (Jupiter and Saturn) live in nearly circular orbits at 5 and 10 AU. \n\nThese discoveries prompted corresponding shifts in solar system evolution theory. We previously believed that planets formed in, or near, their current orbits. However, ice, which plays a significant role in forming the dense solid core of a gas giant, will not condense within 3 AU of a Sun-like star, which in turn implies that gas giant planets are unlikely to form with the small semi-major axes they possess. We now believe that massive planets form outside of this \"snow line\" and subsequently move inward via interactions with a circumstellar disk, a process known as planetary migration. There are two limiting cases in migration theory in a laminar disk: Type I migration, in which a planet lacks sufficient mass to clear a gap in the disk material and is driven inward by a density wake in the disk, and Type II migration, in which massive planets do clear a gap and are driven inward by resonances between the planet and material in the remainder of the disk. If the disk is not laminar, Type I migration can be overwhelmed by turbulent effects (Laughlin et al. 2004, Nelson 2005). \n\nIn the standard description of planetary migration, rings of disk material in resonance with a planet in a nearly circular orbit exert torques on the planet, driving it inward and further decreasing its eccentricity \u01eb (Goldreich and Tremaine 1980, hereafter GT80). This scenario, while appropriate for our solar system, never allows the planet to possess large orbital eccentricity, and hence does not explain the large eccentricities of many detected planetary orbits.",

Among these peculiar features, we highlight two in particular. The first is that our solar system possesses essentially no material closer to the Sun than Mercury, with an orbital radius of 0.4 au (e.g., Durda et al. 2000). In contrast, extrasolar planetary systems are awash with examples of planets orbiting significantly closer than Mercury (Batalha et al. 2013).\n\nA second key aspect of the solar system is that the angular momentum vectors of the eight confirmed planets are mutually inclined by only \u223c1\u00b0-2\u00b0. In the 18th century, this coplanarity inspired the so-called \"Nebular Hypothesis,\" wherein planetary systems originate from flat (i.e., aspect ratios = unity) disks of gas and dust (Kant 1755, Laplace 1796. 3 Given the ubiquity with which planets form within disks (Hartmann 2008), the expectation is that other planetary systems emerge from their protoplanetary nebula possessing a coplanar architecture. However, the frequency with which this coplanarity is retained over gigayear timescales is not fully understood.\n\nObservational determination of mutual inclinations between extrasolar planetary orbits has proved exceedingly difficult (Winn & Fabrycky 2015). Inclined planetary companions are frequently hypothesized as explanations for peculiar signals among transiting planets (Dawson & Chiang 2014;Lai & Pu 2017), and under special circumstances, the orbital properties of these companions may be constrained using transit timing variations (Nesvorn\u1ef3 et al. 2013). In addition, the variation in transit durations within a given multiplanet system reflects mutual inclinations, but are generally limited to small values owing to the requirement that the planets simultaneously transit ). More loosely, stability arguments have been used to place limits upon mutual inclinations in several systems (Laughlin et al. 2002;Veras & Armitage 2004;Nelson et al. 2014).\n\nA separate method of ascertaining mutual inclinations has been to compare the relative numbers of multi-transiting systems to single-transiting systems (Lissauer et al. 2011;Johansen et",

The subset of exoplanetary systems in our data set that have planets discovered at a wide range of separations, particularly those that extend past the ice line, show a similar pattern, with one or more giant \"outer\" planets separated by a wide gap from usually smaller interior planets-with this gap usually being near to but not always at the ice line. \n\nThis pattern suggests a classification system that begins by dividing the exoplanet population into inner planets and outer planets, similar to our own solar system. The inner planets are not necessarily small; there are all-Jupiter systems that have a clear inner-outer divide in their detected planets, most notably HD 27894, which has three giant planets with periods of 18, 36, and 5000 days (F. Feng et al. 2022) However, the outer planets will be large (we provisionally require the \"first outer planet\" to be a Jupiter) and will be separated from the inner planets by a wide period gap, which is also near the ice line (as opposed to a gap between a warm Jupiter and a hot inner planet). 6 but for period ratios vs. inner-planet periods. The two-planet systems show more systems with large period ratios, as is evident from the abundance of purple points near the top of the plot. Meanwhile, the higher-multiplicity systems show more similarity to one another in both plots. Note. The \"all-closely-spaced, no-Jupiter\" systems correspond to the standard definitions of \"peas-in-a-pod\" or \"compact-Kepler-type\" systems, while all others are more irregular in planet size and/or spacing. \n\nThe exact criteria for defining inner and outer planets are not clear, for several reasons. There is the small sample size (only 55 N 3 systems in our data set have any detected Jupiters); the degree of variation between systems, where any specific definition can be expected to produce multiple edge cases; and because of the variation in the location of the ice line with stellar spectral type. \n\nAn additional complication comes from systems like 55 Cnc, which has four giant planets, the innermost of which has a period of only 15 days, separated by a wide gap from an inner USP (V.",

            "text": "a series of additional consequences for the observed structure of the solar system . In particular, it has been shown that the dynamical effects of Planet Nine naturally explain (iii) the existence of highly inclined, large semimajor axis Centaurs (Gomes et al. 2015;Batygin & Brown 2016a), (iv) the six-degree obliquity of the Sun (Bailey et al. 2016;Lai 2016;Gomes et al. 2017), as well as (v) the origins of proximate (a 100 au < ) retrograde KBOs (Batygin & Brown 2016b).\n\nA key characteristic that differentiates the various planetary proposals is the dynamical mechanism through which the envisaged planet generates its observational signatures. In this regard, the Planet Nine (P9) hypothesis remains incomplete. Although numerical simulations reveal that synthetic models of the solar system that include Planet Nine can provide a good match to the observational data (see, however, Nesvorny et al. 2017), the dynamical process through which the physical confinement of the distant orbits occurs remains poorly understood.\n\nThe original study of Batygin & Brown (2016a) suggested that mean-motion resonances (MMRs; including those of high order) are responsible for orbital clustering. Expanding on this idea, Malhotra et al. (2016) suggested that each of the distant KBOs are currently trapped in N:1 and N:2 MMRs with Planet Nine. More recently, Millholland & Laughlin (2017) and Becker et al. (2017) carried out a large-scale numerical exploration of the resonant hypothesis in relation to the existing data, further demonstrating its viability. Meanwhile, Beust (2016) showed that a purely secular treatment of the dynamics provides a good match to the simulation results of Batygin & Brown (2016a), suggesting that resonant dynamics may be irrelevant to the problem at hand. In light of these conflicting results, the dominant P9-KBO interaction mechanism remains elusive, and its identification is the primary purpose of this paper.\n\nAn analytical characterization of P9-KBO coupling is important for three reasons, the first being falsifiability.

            "text": "Observed clustering of extreme trans-Neptunian objects in the outer solar system suggests the possible existence of a planet with a mass of \u223c5-10 M \u2295 , dubbed Planet Nine, at a distance of \u223c400-800 au from the Sun (Brown & Batygin 2016;Batygin et al. 2019). Scholtz & Unwin (2019) suggested that Planet Nine could potentially be a black hole (BH) since the likelihood of trapping for a BH may be comparable to that for a free-floating planet. Zderic & Madigan (2020) argued that Planet Nine may not exist, and its observed gravitational effects could potentially be caused by an unobserved ring of small bodies in the outer solar system. There is also the possibility that the clustering is a statistical fluke (Clement & Kaib 2020). Christian & Loeb (2017) proposed the use of interferometry to measure masses of planets from relativistic spacecraft such as those envisioned by Breakthrough Starshot. 1 The outer solar system generally (Parkin 2018) and Planet Nine specifically (Loeb 2019) were mentioned as potential targets for Breakthrough Starshot. Witten (2020) proposed a search for Planet Nine using subrelativistic spacecraft, which was further investigated by Lawrence & Rogoszinski (2020). Hoang & Loeb (2020) showed that the noise due to density and magnetic fluctuations would dominate over Planet Nine's gravitational signal, making such a search infeasible at speeds well abov\u1ebd = --10 c 300 km s 3 1 . Additionally, such a search would not differentiate between a planet and a BH. Here, we propose a method that does distinguish between a planet and a BH. In particular, we explore the possibility that accretion flares resulting from the tidal disruption of small Oort Cloud bodies by a putative Planet Nine BH (PNBH) could power an observable optical signal that could be searched for with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time 2 (LSST). The search method described here is not restricted solely to primordial BHs, but applies generally to subsolar mass BHs including ones produced by other mechanisms (Shandera et al. 2018).\n\nOur discussion is structured as follows.

            "text": "To see how the Earth-Moon system relates to the development of the other terrestrial planets in the solar system it helps to consider the development of the inner solar system since its initial formation. It is possible to look far back to this initial formation because our solar system exhibits what may be termed a friendly Jupiter. This friendly Jupiter concept means that a large gas giant planet exhibits a nearly circular orbit that allowed the inner solar system to develop with certain regularities that persisted from the early solar system formation (Table 1). One such regularity, is that there is an expectation that the average densities of the terrestrial planets can be expected to decrease as the temperature decreases as the formation zone of a planet is positioned at greater distances away from the Sun. This expectation is illustrated in Figure 9 which shows the average terrestrial planet density as a function of the distance away from the Sun. The fact that our solar system has a friendly Jupiter has allowed this density relationship to have persisted over the last 4.5 billion years. It should be noticed that Mercury and Venus do not have any satellite moons, and that Mars only has a few larger rocks as satellites. Thus the three terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, and Mars allow the plotting of the line shown in Figure 9 (Table 1). The expected density of the pre-Earth and pre-Moon can then be determined as the density of a terrestrial planet for a distance of about 1 astronomical unit, 1 AU, from the Sun. For the Earth to result from an oblique collision of the pre-Earth as being an approximately Mars sized object with an approximate size of 1/2 the World Journal of Condensed Matter Physics  1). An important result of this collision was that the Earth, rather unexpectedly, became the terrestrial planet with the highest average density! \n\nThe terrestrial planets formed by converting gravitational potential energy into differentiated bodies with enough heat involved to cause hot interior cores. \n\nDuring the compaction process, there is the expectation that a large fraction of water would be boiled off. Comets carrying water back to the terrestrial planets provides a mechanism that yields surface oceans. For a condition of rapid bombardment as expected during the early inner solar system formation there is the expectation that the number of impacts was proportional to the planet cross section which is proportional to the radius squared.",

            "text": "Nine. The orbits of objects within this boundary do not cross Planet Nine's orbit and are thus protected from close encounters (see the stable purple libration cycles). Objects that do cross this curve, however, are eventually driven into the inner solar system through Planet Nine-induced secular dynamics, becoming short-lived centaurs. An instance of such dynamics is shown in pink, with the green stars denoting close encounters. This object only survives 100 Myr, as it is suffers a rapid decrease in q and is engulfed by the canonical planets shortly after crossing into the Planet Nine collisional domain. The right panel shows the full trajectories of all surviving objects in the planar simulations on the \u0394\u03d6-a phase plane. The surviving population includes objects that are aligned (pink), anti-aligned (dark blue), highly inclined and often retrograde (green), and circulating in \u0394\u03d6 (light blue). The dynamics of the highly inclined population are outside the scope of this work, but are thoroughly discussed in Batygin & Morbidelli (2017). The blue collision curve is constructed by locating the maximal allowed libration width of the relative longitude of perihelion in the corresponding e-\u0394\u03d6 plot for each value of a. All orbital configurations within the blue curve are orbit-crossing with Planet Nine. Thus, all nonresonant aligned objects are found outside of this orbit-crossing region. compute the collision curve for a particular a, we find the value of the eccentricity of the test particle for which its orbit first touches Planet Nine's orbit, given a fixed \u0394\u03d6 (marked by stars in Figure 3). We then iterate this procedure for varying values of \u0394\u03d6. The location of the tangential collision curve is thus determined by the semimajor axis of the object. In fact, the area of the non-orbit-crossing region and the width of the allowed longitude of perihelion librations is dependent on the a/a 9 ratio. As the semimajor axis of the test particles approaches that of Planet Nine, the region in which the orbits of these objects can remain without crossing Planet Nine's orbit becomes more and more limited, until it vanishes in the limit a\uf0a0\u2192\uf0a0a 9 .\n\nIndeed, this effect is evident in our simulation results.

Nonetheless, theoretical models of their interiors 10 imply that all of the planets in this class are 'gas-poor' , that is, less than half -in most cases much less -of their mass consists of hydrogen and helium (H/He). By contrast, H/He make up more than 98% of our Sun's mass as well as substantial majorities of the masses of Jupiter, Saturn and almost all known giant exoplanets with R p > 9 R E .\n\nKepler's primary mission is to conduct a statistical census of the abundance of planets as a function of planetary size, orbital period and stellar type. Kepler has found that planets are common, with the number of planets in the extended solar neighbourhood of our Galaxy being comparable with, or larger than, the number of stars 11 . Of particular interest is \u03b7 E , the average number of Earth-like planets per star. 'Earth-like' means having a radius similar to that of Earth and receiving about as much energy flux from its host star as Earth receives from our Sun; a more precise definition is given later. With some extrapolation downward in size and longward in orbital period, Kepler data suggest that \u03b7 E is ~0.1, although, as discussed later, there is a broad range of estimates for this value. Earlier studies 12,13 have found giant planets to be much more common around stars that are richer in heavy elements relative to light gases; Kepler data have shown that no comparable trend exists for small planets 14,15 . Almost half of Kepler's planet candidates are in systems in which multiple transiting planets have been found. As we discuss, the large abundance of such systems implies that flat systems containing multiple planets on closely spaced orbits are quite common. This finding supports models of planet formation within a disk of material orbiting a star first developed by Immanuel Kant and Pierre-Simon Laplace.\n\nBecause of Kepler's success, NASA extended the operations of the spacecraft beyond the original baseline plan, but Kepler's prime mission ended in May 2013 with the failure of a second reaction wheel that made precise stable pointing away from the spacecraft'",

In order to determine what mass is appropriate for separating planets into giant planets and lowmass planets, we look from the theoretical point of view. Planets with masses larger than \u223c15 M \u2295 have reached the crossover mass, which means that the runaway gas accretion process has begun. This process ends only when there is no residual gas in the disc or a gap forms near the planet's orbit, so planets with masses larger than 15 M \u2295 are giant planets or failed giant planets (= Neptunes). These are the planets considered for our classification.\n\nOn the other hand, based on the observations, we note that these planets are located either near the central star (at distances less than 1 au), in an intermediate zone, or far away (at distances larger than 30 au), a fact that is the basis of our classification.\n\nWe then separate all the planetary systems according to the following classification.\n\n(i) Hot and warm Jupiter systems. These planetary systems host planets with masses larger than 15 M \u2295 at a distance less than 1 au.\n\n(ii) Solar systems. A planetary system is an analogue of our Solar system if it harbours giant planets or Neptunes located between 1 and 30 au.\n\n(iii) Combined systems. These planetary systems harbour at least one giant planet within 1 au and at least one in the middle part of the disc, between 1 and 30 au.\n\n(iv) Cold Jupiter systems. If giant planets are located farther than 30 au, then they are cold Jupiter systems.\n\n(v) Low-mass planetary systems. These systems have only planets with masses less than 15 M \u2295 .\n\nIn Table 1, we show the statistics of the population of planetary systems observed. In order to compare with our population of artificial planetary systems, we eliminate from the observed sample those planetary systems formed around binary or multiple stars, as well as those where the mass of the central star is less than 0.7 or greater than 1.4 M . The total number of observed planetary systems analysed in the table is 315. 1 We",

            "text": "For 47 UMa, a system containing three gas giants, we did the same type of investigation, but in addition we checked how a possible Earth-mass planet could get its water inventory from comets. Three different cases were pursued: an Earth-mass planet placed at 1 au, another Earth-mass planet placed at 1.5 au, and a third Earthmass planet in the 3:2 MMR with the innermost system planet (47 UMa b); the habitable zone in 47 UMa is confined approximately between \u223c0.9 au and \u223c2.1 au for this late-stage main-sequence star. The results show that there is little opportunity for the Earth-mass planets to collect water due to cometary collisions. If water is present on any of those planets (if existing), an alternate mechanism of transport is required; see, e.g., Raymond and Izidoro [2017] and references therein for proposed scenarios. \n\nHD 141399, a star hosting four massive gas giants, was the final exoplanetary system of our investigations aimed at studying cometary dynamics. In all of our numerical experiments, the outermost planet, although the least massive, suffered from many collisions, whereas the innermost giant planet had only very few ones. \n\nAs a supplementary aspect of our study, we also checked the Tisserand parameter T for the systems. However, no suitable information could be obtained from these values depicted in figure 16. It is well-known that in the Solar System Jupiter's role is dominant (Carusi and Valsecchi [1992], Carusi et al. [1995]). However, for HD 10108 the gas giant at a = 3.4 au (planet h) cannot play a dominant role due to the presence of another gas giant at a = 1.4 au (planet g). Hence, no cometary family akin to the Jupiter family in the Solar System can therefore occur. Furthermore, in the other systems investigated here the Tisserand parameter is not giving important information on the cometary orbits either.",

            "text": "The last decade has seen the discovery of Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets orbiting Solar-type stars. In roughly one fifth of the cases recorded to date a planet is inferred to be in nearly circular orbit (having eccentricities less than 0.05) at a distance from the parent star of less than fifteen Solar radii (\u223c 0.06 au). In the rest of the detections the planets are inferred to have eccentricities up to 0.7 (with a mean value of 0.3), for semimajor axes in the range 0.07-3 au (Vogt et al. 2000). Thus the orbital characteristics of many of the known extrasolar systems contrast strongly with the gas giants of the Solar system that have eccentricities less than about 0.05 and semimajor axes greater than 5 au. These new discoveries pose a considerable challenge to the standard models of planetary formation that are based on our knowledge of the Solar system alone. \n\nAccording to the accumulation model, protoplanetary cores, the building blocks of planet formation, condense from the interstellar dust grains that are initially suspended in the gaseous protostellar disc. These first aggregate to form planetesimals of mass 10 18 -10 20 gm (e.g. Weidenschilling & Cuzzi 1993). Seed cores then grow up to an isolation mass, passing through a process of runnaway accretion (Lissauer & Stewart 1993). The duration of this growth phase is expected to be on the order of 10 5 yr at 1 au (eg. see the reviews by Lin, Bryden, &Ida, 1999, andPapaloizou, Terquem &Nelson, 1999 andreferences therein). After isolation the orbits of cores do not overlap so that the system evolution slows significantly. Adopting a heavy element surface density of 6 gm cm \u22122 , characteristic of the minimum mass Solar nebula, the protoplanetary cores at isolation are thought to have roughly 0.03M\u2295 at 1 au from the Sun (Lissauer & Stewart 1993, Lin et al. 1999). For a surface density ten times larger this increases to 1M\u2295. \n\nThe cores subsequently interact under their mutual gravitational attraction which can lead to collisions and the consequent production of more massive cores.",

            "text": "The physical understanding of the Titius-Bode law is a long-standing problem in planetary physics since 250 years. In this study we interpret the quasi-regular geometric pattern of planet distances from the Sun as a result of a self-organizing process that acts throughout the life time of our solar system. The underlying physical mechanism is linked to the celestial mechanics of harmonic orbit resonances. The results may be useful for searches of exo-planets orbiting around stars. Our conclusions are: \n\n1. The original form of the Titius-Bode law on distances of the planets to the Sun is a purely empirical law and cannot be derived from any existing physical model, although it fits the observations to some extent, but fails for the extremal planets Mercury, Neptune and Pluto. The \"generalized form of the Titius-Bode law\" assumes a constant geometric progression factor Q = R i+1 /R i , which we find also to be inconsistent with the data, since the observed distance ratios vary in the range of Q \u2248 1.3 \u2212 2.1, corresponding to a variation of q = T i+1 /T i \u2248 1.5 \u2212 3.0 of the orbital periods, according to Kepler's third law, q \u221d Q 3/2 . 2. The observed orbital period ratios q i of the planets in our solar system correspond to five harmonic ratios, (H i+1 /H i ) = (3:2), (5:3), (2:1), (5:4), (3:1), which represent the dominant harmonic orbit resonances that self-organize the orbits in the solar system. We find that the progression factor q i for time periods follows approximately a linear function q i = q 1 + (i \u2212 1)\u2206q, i = 1, ..., n, which varies in the range from the smallest harmonic ratio q 1 = (3 : 2) = 1.5 of the innermost planet to q n = (3 : 1) = 3.0 for the outermost planet, with a gradient of \u2206q = 0.16 \u00b1 0.05.",

            "text": "would it be visible in infrared imaging of the system? When Venus is excluded from the analysis of the inner solar system, there is an additional large peak in the relative likelihood at \u223c190 days, slightly interior to the actual orbit of Venus at 224 days. When Earth is excluded, there is a large peak at \u223c390 days, slightly exterior to the actual orbit of Earth. Interestingly, in the case where Earth is excluded, all dynamical stability methods predict a small but noticeable probability of injecting a planet between Mercury and Venus at \u223c140 days. However, given the eccentricity of Mercury, it is likely that any planet positioned at this spot in period space could cause Mercury and/or the other planet to become unstable. DyNAMITE also finds a significant likelihood of another planet interior to the orbit of Mercury, although less likely than at the orbital period of the planet excluded from the analysis. We do know that there are no planets interior to Mercury, but it is well known that in this aspect, the solar system is atypical (e.g., Mulders et al. 2018); observers from another planetary system who have determined similar exoplanet demographic data to us would likely be surprised to not find a planet within 88 days in the solar system.\n\nThe distribution for the predicted planet radius for additional planets in the inner solar system is shown in Figure 10. We find it is well matched to the terrestrial planets, since Jupiter is much larger than the rest of the planets and therefore would not be in the same \"cluster\" of planet radius via the clustered radius model from SysSim (He et al. 2019). DyNAMITE does find that there would be some probability of finding a planet with a comparatively large physical size, but the main peak in the planet radius distribution is centered on the size of the terrestrial planets.\n\nIn conclusion, our analysis is quite successful at predicting the presence of whichever planet is excluded from the inner solar system, as well as the position of the asteroid belt corresponding to a potential additional planet. While the solar system is atypical as compared to the systems in the Kepler population on which our analysis is based (e.g., Mulders et al. 2018), the accurate predictions from DyNAMITE on the solar system offer another validation of our analysis.",

The elemental abundances in the photospheres unveil the bulk compositions of the accreted parent bodies with a precision far greater than can be attained with any other technique currently available to astronomers. The most significant discovery, overall, is that rocky extrasolar planets have bulk elemental compositions similar to those of Earth and other rocky objects in our solar system. The white dwarf studies reveal that many extrasolar minor planets (asteroids) are differentiated, possessing analogs of terrestrial crust, mantle, and core; this finding has important implications for the origin of our own solar system.",

It became clear that many objects orbited between Mars and Jupiter, and that all of them were much smaller than any of the six planets known to the ancients, as well as Uranus and Neptune. These small bodies were therefore reclassified as \"minor planets\" or \"asteroids\", and the number of \"planets\" dropped down to eight. \n\nPluto was found in 1930. Although it was much fainter than the other planets, no minor planets more distant than the Jupiter Trojans were known at the time, and Pluto was near the location predicted for a \u223c 6 M \u2295 (Earth mass) planet hypothesized to explain unaccounted for deviations of Neptune's orbit, so Pluto was quickly accepted as the ninth planet orbiting our Sun. \n\nHowever, subsequent data showed that Pluto was much smaller and less massive than initially thought. Pluto's absolute magnitude decreased as it approached perihelion, and further study showed that Neptune's orbit was better explained without a massive perturber at Pluto's location. Analysis of the orbit of Pluto's large moon Charon, which was discovered in 1978, implied that Pluto was only 4% as massive as Mercury, the smallest of the eight other bodies regarded as planets. \n\nThe minor planet 1992 QB1, later named 15760 Albion, which like Pluto had a semimajor axis larger than that of Neptune, was discovered in 1992 (Jewitt and Luu, 1993). Many other bodies were discovered in this region, referred to as the Kuiper Belt, in subsequent years.

While Venus will eventually be engulfed and Mars will most certainly survive, the final fate of the Earth is rather uncertain and critically depends on the stellar-mass-loss rate during the solar RGB phase [34], which remains poorly constrained [35]. Certain models predict that the Earth may be engulfed during the solar tip-RGB phase due to tidal interactions and dynamical drag [36,37]. Nevertheless, if Earth had indeed survived, then its orbit is expected to expand to around twice its current size, comparable to the current orbit for KB200414Lb.

Understanding the relationship between ISM and exoplanet habitability is a growing field of research (H. Vannier 2020).

Observations have provided evidence of subsurface liquid water oceans covered by icy shells on multiple objects in the Solar System, called ocean worlds, including the icy moons of Jupiter (Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) and of Saturn (Titan and Enceladus) as well as dwarf planets (Ceres and Pluto) (see [83] for a review and De [33]). The NASA/ESA/ASI Cassini-Huygens mission (2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017) has done much to advance our understanding of the Saturn system in general and Titan and Enceladus in particular, and has shown these satellites of Saturn to be two favourable locations in the Solar System in our quest for a better understanding of the evolution of the Solar System and its habitable potential. Both Saturnian moons possess energy sources, liquid habitats, nutrients (organic compounds), and transport cycles of liquid moving nutrients and waste, all necessary ingredients for habitability [46,92]. Titan is the only active extraterrestrial alkanological system in the Solar System (analogous to the Earth's hydrological system), including an organically rich atmosphere, hydrocarbon lakes and seas on the surface and a liquid water subsurface ocean. Enceladus has active plumes composed of multiple jets containing complex organics and water vapour and likely connected to its liquid water subsurface ocean. Along with their energy sources, these bodies are prime environments in which to investigate the conditions for the emergence of life and habitability conditions of ocean worlds in the outer Solar System, as well as the origin and evolution of gas giant planetary systems, in a single mission. \n\nThe Cassini-Huygens mission also introduced new first order scientific questions for geologists, astrobiologists, organic chemists, and planetary scientists, that remain unanswered to date [30,36,117,151].",

If the minor planet is treated as a spheroid and fits the density formula, this finding indicates that the density of the minor planet tends to a certain value, it also means that the planet is proportional to the radius squared. However, this proportional relationship does not hold for giant planets. To draw more reliable conclusions, we included asteroids within the solar system for reference. Unsurprisingly, asteroids in the solar system also followed the trend of positive correlation, which is undoubtedly a good result. However, due to the differences between the solar system and the planetary systems in our selected samples as well as observational errors, the fitting line we obtained is not very close to the solar system data. Nevertheless, it can still generally explain the trend.",

            "text": "In the works [13,14], indications were obtained that * e-mail: eroshenko@inr.ac.ru the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects are correlated in a certain way, which may point to the presence of 9th planet with a mass 5 \u2212 10M \u2295 on the periphery of the solar system. The probable parameters of its orbit are: the semimajor axis a = 400 \u2212 1000 au, the eccentricity e = 0.2 \u2212 0.5 and the inclination 30 \u2212 60 \u2022 . A planet with similar orbital parameters could also be captured in the solar system [10,15]. In the work [16], the hypothesis was proposed that the 9th planet is a captured primordial black hole (PBH). \n\nIn the above works, the capture into an already formed planetary system was considered. In this paper, we point out the existence of another (additional) capture mechanism at the stage before the formation of a planetary system and even before the formation of a star. We are considering the capture of free-floating planets in a contracting protostellar cloud. When a planet passes by a static gravitating object, the planet first gains kinetic energy, and then loses exactly the same kinetic energy. If a planet flies into a contracting protostellar cloud, then when moving to the center of the cloud, a smaller force of attraction acts on the planet than when moving further away from the center, because the density of the cloud increases over time, and the force of gravity at a fixed radial distance from the center increases with time. As a result, a planet floating into the cloud at the stage of approaching the center of the cloud acquires less kinetic energy than it loses at a subsequent fly out from the center. With a sufficiently large difference between the lost and acquired energies, the planet may end up in a finite elliptical orbit. \n\nIn this paper, we performed statistical modelling and found the probability of capturing planets in a contracting cloud. With certain plausible assumptions about the structure of the cloud and the structure of the surrounding region of star formation, it turns out that the probability of capture into the cloud is comparable to the probability of capture into an already formed planetary system. Due to this, the overall probability of capturing the planets increases by about 70%.",

            "text": "On the other hand, n could also be increased by a large factor. The rate of ejection of bodies from a planet in a hypothetic planetary system depends on the heavy bombardment in that system. So far we have taken the heavy bombardment to be the same as in our Solar System during the period 4.5 Gyr to 3.8 Gyr ago. However, the collision rate of comets on the Earth can be increased by as much as a factor of 1000 if the protective influence of Jupiter is removed (Wetherill 1994). It may well be that in most planetary systems there is no Jupiter-like protective planet and that the heavy bombardment is therefore much greater than what has been experienced in our solar system. Our calculated values of n could be underestimates by a factor of hundred or so. \n\nWe may also consider different versions of the planetary systems at the receiving end for life-carrying bodies from other stars. Just to see what effect the variation of the planet arrangement may have on calculated collision rates, we have considered two additional systems : 1) an extrasolar system like ours but without Jupiter, and 2) an extrasolar system like ours but where Jupiter was assumed to be at 0.2 AU distance from the Sun. The positions and the masses of the other planets, including the third terrestrial planet, were supposed to be unchanged. Case 2 was studied because many of the planetary systems discovered so far have a Jupiter-type giant planet close to the star. \n\nWe found that the first alteration, removing Jupiter altogether, reduced the collision rate on the third planet to a level which is not significantly greater than the rate of direct collisions without the influence of major planets. Therefore we conclude that Jupiter has the effect of increasing the collision rate by a factor of about 40 above the direct (first orbital crossing) collision rate. Jupiter captures passing bodies which become long-lived members of our system and then sometimes collide with the Earth at a later time. \n\nThe second model, in which Jupiter was placed close to the Sun, had the opposite effect: \n\nthe collision rate with the third planet was doubled. This is because the inner Jupiter captures passing bodies very efficiently to Earth-crossing orbits which subsequently have a high probability of collision with the Earth.",

            "text": "The hunt for Planet Nine continues by selecting the most likely positions in the sky (Brown & Batygin 2021;Socas-Navarro 2023), calculating theoretical fluxes in various bands (Ginzburg et al. 2016;Wright et al. 2010;Planck Collaboration et al. 2014, 2016;Cowan et al. 2016;Linder & Mordasini 2016) and conducting/planning surveys (Trilling et al. 2018;Naess et al. 2021;Rowan-Robinson 2022). So far, Planet Nine has not been discovered. According to the flux models, the planet is detectable, but a large area of the sky must be searched with large telescopes to detect or rule out the putative planet of our solar system. \n\nIn this paper we have investigated the effects of Modified Newtonian Dynamics on the evolution and dynamical origin of extreme trans-Neptunian objects. We found that the observed objects could originate from the planetary region of the solar system, with semimajor axes on the order of a few to a few tens of astronomical units. A striking example is Sedna, which could have been in a horseshoe orbit with Jupiter and Saturn about 30 Myr ago. According to this scenario, ETNOs were scattered by the giant planets into orbits with high- and  \u2208 (5, 30) au, which were then detached from the influence of the planets by EFE. According to MOND, both ETNOs and Centaurs are ephemeral objects whose evolution is strongly chaotic. \n\nMilgromian dynamics explains the formation of ETNOs in a natural way. Particularly interesting objects are the newly discovered retrograde ETNOs with relatively small  and large , which have been shown to belong to the same dynamical class as the already known prograde ETNOs and Centaurs. These objects are dynamically unconnected when Newtonian dynamics is used. MOND produces the clustering of orbital planes as well as the apsidal confinement, but these features are not particularly strong in this model. On the other hand, the observations are still inconclusive. More new objects are clearly needed to enrich the sample and confirm or rule out the anomalous features of ETNOs.",

            "text": "Planet Nine is the only massive perturber and the giant planets-Jupiter through Neptune-are accounted for with a J 2 approximation. In these simulations, the anti-aligned objects remain in the same resonance for the entire length of the integration time. The lack of resonance hopping in this case is due to the absence of an active Neptune, and consequently, the absence of TNO-Neptune scattering interactions. Similarly, work in Becker et al. (2017), which treated only Neptune and Planet Nine as active particles, found that dynamically stable objects can change resonances many times during integrations of the same length. While Becker et al. (2017) did not consider whether objects were aligned or anti-aligned with Planet Nine, the increased rate of movement between resonances compared with the case where Neptune is treated as a perturbation on the solar potential is consistent with our current work.\n\nIn this work, we use the Planet Nine orbit from the initial Batygin & Brown (2016) study, with a 9 \uf0a0=\uf0a0700 au and e 9 \uf0a0=\uf0a00.6. Although recent estimates have favored a somewhat lower semimajor axis and lower eccentricity orbit for Planet Nine , we choose to retain the original proposed orbit for ease in making comparisons with earlier work. The effect of Planet Nine on the outer solar system is quite robust: all of the orbits in the generally accepted range of parameter space (see Figure 15 of Batygin et al. 2019) achieve a qualitatively similar structure, and thus the exact orbit does not matter as long we view the results through a statistical lens. This is shown in Figures 17, 18 and 19 of Batygin et al. (2019), which recreates the phase space trajectories for three distinct orbits of Planet Nine, and the behavior in all three phase spaces is similar (although the exact parameters of TNOs that will appear clustered may change).\n\nFollowing previous studies, we have considered this resonance hopping situation in the near planar case, with slightly inclined test particles but a non-inclined Planet Nine. Even in this idealized context, it is clear that residing in a resonance is not necessary to maintain anti-alignment nor long term stability. The next step in continued analysis of this problem is to consider resonance hopping effects in fully inclined simulations. Although we expect to find fewer resonant events in",

            "text": "of pebbles (millimeter-/centimetergrains) re-distributed the amount of solids in the inner disk. The latter scenario, in combination with streaming instability triggered by the accumulation of inward migrating pebbles at the snowline, has been put forward to explain the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system (Ormel et al. 2017). To first order this scenario can also explain the Kepler mass-ratio function as the pebble isolation mass scales linearly with stellar mass and the cube of the disk aspect ratio; see Equation (15) in Ormel et al. (2017), which, however, is the same for radial distances in the disk at the same temperature (Mulders & Dominik 2012).\n\nSecond, our results help to place the solar system into context. With rocky planets interior to gaseous planets, the solar system broadly follows the combined mass-ratio function inferred from Kepler and microlensing. However, the most common planet mass inside the snowline is well above that of Earth, pointing to accretion of a substantial gas envelope (e.g., Lopez & Fortney 2014), while the most common planet outside the snowline is less massive than the gas giants in the solar system. Thus, the exoplanet population appears to have a less extreme radial distribution of planetary masses than the solar system. This is in line with a more efficient re-distribution of solids from the outer to the inner disk (e.g., Izidoro et al. 2015).\n\nFinally, our best-fit broken power laws as a function of planet orbital period, mass, and stellar type are key inputs to exoplanet yield calculations for future missions. Within the next four years, Gaia is expected to discover of the order of 10,000 new giant planets around A through to M dwarfs, many of which will be close to and beyond the snowline (e.g., Perryman et al. 2014;Sozzetti et al. 2014). Combined with the growing number of lower-mass planets discovered via transit, radial velocity, and microlensing, it will be possible to test whether the shape of the mass-ratio function beyond the snowline is also universal.\n\nThe authors thank Savita Mathur and Daniel Huber for sharing some of their results on stellar properties in advance",

            "text": "Roughly 400 years ago, Galileo's observations of the Jovian moons sealed the Copernican Revolution, and the Earth was no longer considered the centre of the Universe (Sidereus Nuncius, 1610). We are now poised to extend this revolution to the Solar System. The detection and characterisation of exoplanets force the Sun and its cohorts to abdicate from their privileged position as the archetype of a planetary system.\n\nRecent exoplanet discoveries have profoundly changed our understanding of the formation, structure, and composition of planets. Current statistics show that planets are common; data from the Kepler Mission and microlensing surveys indicate that the majority of stars have planets (Fressin et al. 2013;Cassan et al., 2012). Detected planets range in size from sub-Earths to larger than Jupiter (Figure 1). Unlike the Solar System, the distribution of planetary radii appears continuous (Batalha et al., 2013), with no gap between 2 to 4 Earth radii. That is, there appears to be no distinct transition from telluric planets, with a thin, if any, secondary atmosphere, to the gaseous and icy giants, which retain a substantial amount of hydrogen and helium accreted from the protoplanetary disk.\n\nThe orbital characteristics among the almost 2000 exoplanets detected also do not follow the Solar System trend, with small rocky bodies orbiting close to a G star and giant gas planets orbiting further out, in roughly circular orbits. Instead giant planets can be found within 1/10 the semi-major axis of Mercury. Planets can orbit host stars with an eccentricity well above 0.9 (e.g. HD 80606b), comparable to Halley's comet. Planets can orbit two mother stars (e.g. Kepler-34b, Kepler-35b, and Kepler-38b): this is not an oddity any more.\n\nPlanetary systems appear much more diverse than expected. The Solar System template, well explained by our current understanding of planetary formation and evolution, does not seem to be generally applicable. The range of orbital parameters and stellar hosts translates into planetary temperatures that span two orders of magnitude. This range of temperatures arises from the range of planet-star proximities, where a year can be less than 6 Earth",

            "text": "It is not known whether the asteroid belt is common in exosystems or is special to our solar system. Analogous to our solar system, the formation of extrasolar Jovian planets affects the population and dynamical distribution of exo-asteroids. If we can detect the evaporated ice materials, chemically evolved molecules, collisional dust rings, or heat released by the collisions together with proto-Jupiter in the exosystems, it could help determine the history of formation of the asteroid belt. To connect the observations of exosystems to our asteroids, studies on planetesimal evolutions caused by the extrasolar Jovian planets with various masses, eccentricities, and semimajor axes are necessary.\n\nIn this study, we numerically examined the orbital evolutions of planetesimals in the asteroid region under the influences of the Jovian planet, protoplanetary disk gravity, and gas drag. In Nagasawa et al. (2014), we only considered a Jovian planet with current size and orbital parameters. In addition, the planetesimal size was limited to 300 km, and all planetesimals were located at 4.1 au. The gas drag formula they used is not suitable for high-speed planetesimals. In this paper, although we have considered our solar system as the base, we have changed the density of the gas disk, the planetesimal size and location, and the mass, eccentricity, and semimajor axis of the Jovian planet. We also adopt the gas drag formula that depends on the Mach speed. The eccentricity evolution of asteroids is controlled by excitation because of the resonances and damping due to the gas drag. In Section 2, we describe the equations used in the numerical simulations. The numerical results are shown in Section 3. Secular resonance excites the asteroidal eccentricity up to e\uf0a0\u223c\uf0a00.6-0.8 according to our solar system . The purple solid line shows the maximum relative velocity of the planetesimal whose apocenter crosses the Jovian orbit. A minimum-mass gas disk is assumed here for evaluating the shock temperature.

            "text": "More than 400 years have passed since the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno was burnt for the boldness of imagining that the Universe is composed of a multitude of worlds similar to ours. His vision of the infinity of the world, then considered heretical, is about to be confirmed by astronomers. \n\nThe first such discovery was made by scientists at the Observatory in Geneva on October 6, 1995, when they identified a giant planet that gravitates around the 51 Pegasus star, about 40 light-years from Earth. Since then, over 300 extrasolar planets (or exoplanets that revolve around stars other than the Sun) have been identified and 20 stellar systems that concentrate a corps of planets. The orbital characteristics and physical properties of these newly discovered celestial bodies make it necessary to improve and update the theories about planet formation, especially to explain the existence of some for very short periods of time, to clarify their eccentric orbits and to justify certain physical properties, such as mass and nucleus. In addition, the stars around which gravity these planets are much richer in heavier elements than the Sun. \n\nA first important finding: The diversity of planetary systems surpasses that of our solar system. Most of the extrasolar planets are giant (with a diameter of over 48,000 km), at least as imposing as Jupiter, the largest planet of the solar system. But they are closer to their star than Mercury Sun and, in addition, they are moving in very elongated orbits, some even around stars floating freely through space. On the other hand, the predominance of very large planets could only be apparent as a result of the lack of precision and sensitivity of current detection tools and methods, which could not identify \"small\" planets of the Earth's dimensions. To discover new celestial bodies, astronomers use various methods, the most effective being velocimetry (measuring the velocity and direction of a fluid, for example, air). By velocimetry, astronomers calculate the variations in the radial velocity of the star around which gravitates the respective planets. But not all planets can be detected by this method. Given its current degree of accuracy, only planets with a mass of at least seven times the terrestrial mass can be identified. If Velocimetry is applied to our solar system, only Jupiter could be identified.",

            "text": "Physically adequate relativistic description of the lunar motion is not conceivable without a self-consistent theory of relativistic reference frames in the Earth-Moon system as it orbits the barycenter of the solar system. The solar system has a hierarchic structure associated with the diversity of masses of the solar system bodies and the presence of planetary satellite systems, which form a set of gravitationally bounded sub-systems of the solar system consisting of a planet and its satellites. The most massive body of the solar system is Sun. Therefore, in accordance with the heliocentric point of view the planets orbit Sun because their masses are significantly smaller than that of Sun. Nevertheless, major planets of the solar system, like Jupiter and Saturn, pull Sun by their gravitational fields strong enough making it to revolve at some distance (less than two solar radii [160]) around a common solar-system barycenter (SSB). A global, solar-system barycentric frame is required to describe the orbital motion of Sun and planets around the SSB. On the other hand, rotational motion of Sun and planets is more natural to describe in their local frames associated with each of the bodies. Many planets have their natural satellites which orbit the planet. A planet with its satellites form a sub-system of the solar system which can be considered as essentially isolated from the rest of the solar system. This is because the principle of equivalence applied to the sub-system, reduces gravitational attraction of the external bodies to the tidal force that is much smaller than the gravity of the planet. If the ratio of masses of a planet and its satellites is not negligibly small, it is convenient to introduce a local coordinate frame associated with the barycenter of the sub-system consisting of the planet and its satellites. This is because motion of the barycenter of the sub-system around the SSB approximates the Keplerian ellipse fairly well, while the planet and its satellites oscillates on their orbits around the barycenter of the sub-system. The hierarchic structure of the coordinate frames in the solar system leads to a natural decomposition of orbital motion of each body in the solar system in a trigonometric series of fundamental harmonics like in case of the Fourier expansion.\n\nFrom",

            "text": "Authors, notably including Trujillo & Sheppard (2014), Batygin & Brown (2016), and Malhotra et al. (2016), have raised the possibility that the solar system contains an as-yet-undetected planet orbiting far beyond Neptune (typical models often invoke an M\uf0a0\u223c\uf0a010 M \u2295 body on an eccentric orbit with P\uf0a0\u223c\uf0a02\uf0a0\u00d7\uf0a010 4 yr). Evidence for such a \"Planet Nine\" is indirect, however, and rests primarily on the larger-than-expected degree of orbital alignment among the most distant KBOs. Additional clues are provided by the observed population of Centaur-like objects with high inclinations that are difficult to explain through alternative mechanisms (Batygin & Brown 2016 Direct optical searches for Planet Nine in reflected sunlight are rendered difficult by the r \u22124 decrease in brightness with distance, and they become extremely challenging for V\uf0a0\uf089\uf0a023-24, especially in regions that are crowded with stars. Directed searches at infrared wavelengths (e.g., Meisner et al. 2018) for self-luminous trans-Neptunian planets are stymied by the detection limits of wide-field space-based surveys (e.g., WISE, Wright et al. 2010;NEOWISE, Mainzer et al. 2011) unless a planet exists that is much larger and warmer than expected. Because Planet Nine's emission is expected to peak at submillimeter wavelengths (50-100 \u03bcm), cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys provide an alternative method to search for Planet Nine through its parallactic motion (Cowan et al. 2016). However, only a few current and upcoming CMB surveys have the requisite sensitivity (Cowan et al. 2016), and the effectiveness of this search method relies upon assumptions about Planet Nine's flux while also requiring a specific observing mode that repeatedly maps the same large regions of the sky at a cadence of a few months. Synergies between multiple detection methods may exist (Baxter et al. 2018), but a definitive assessment remains elusive. Furthermore, in the case that a ninth planet does not exist, it is difficult to rule out its presence simply through the lack of a direct detection.\n\nFortunately, however, indirect detection via the planet's tidal gravity signature may be feasible.

Several other follow up studies supported the existence of Planet Nine by different methods (Fienga et al. 2016;Holman & Payne 2016). Additionally, Li & Adams (2016) calculated the survival rates and the interaction cross section of the proposed planet, and Lawler et al. ( 2016) investigated the impact of Planet Nine of the Kuiper belt objects. Perets & Kouwenhoven (2012) described a mechanism of a planet captured from a different star system or a rouge planet, and predicted a wide, eccentric and inclined orbit of the captured planet. \n\nIn this work we explore the interaction of a captured Planet Nine with an initially flat ecliptic disk around the Sun. The disk we consider represents the early debris disk a remnant from the Sun's formation era. For a short time interaction of a planet and a ring of debris around it, see Lee & Chiang (2016). We show that Planet Nine, due to its large sma, dominates the evolution of the outer disk between 1000 \u2212 5000AU. This results in a spheroidal structure at 1100AU aTAUS 1500AU where TAUS stands for \"Thousand AU Sphere\", surrounded by an inclined disk aligned to Planet Nine orbital plane and a warped disk towards the ecliptic plane. This structure serves as a new source of Sun grazing comets, penetrating the inner solar system by long term secular evolution and dynamical interaction with Planet Nine. \n\nOur paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the numerical simulation. In section 3 we describe the results of the numerical runs in comparison to the standard Hills cloud formation mechanism, i.e. a fly-by event in the early stages of the solar system. In section 4 we present the implications of TAUS to the morphology of the outer solar system as well as the rate and orientation of comets originating from this region. Finally, we summarize the results and their implications in section 5.",

Batygin & Brown ( 2016a ) have shown that Kozai-Lidov models demand the unorthodox presence of multiple distant planets in close proximity to the individual TNOs, which even then would cluster only the arguments ( \u03c9) and not the longitudes of perihelion ( ) and would fail to generate confinement in the orbital poles (i.e. inclination, i , and longitude of ascending node, ). Likewise, although the selfgravity of long-term stable, eccentric shepherding discs does lead to the confinement of through an apsidally anti-aligned secular MNRAS 00, 1-11 (2023) equilibrium at high eccentricities (Sefilian & Touma 2019 ), that such a delicately sustained orbital configuration would survive the history of the Solar system is questionable. On the contrary, the influence of a singular distant, eccentric, super-Earth-type object -Planet nine -that is apsidally antialigned with the observed KBOs furnishes both an analytically and numerically satisfactory account of all the aforementioned anomalies. Through distinct octupole-level dynamics, Planet nine simultaneously modulates the degrees of freedom related to the TNO's eccentricities, inclinations, nodes, and apsidal angles in a way that leads to the observed confinement and the orbit-flipping behaviour seen in high-inclination KBOs (Batygin et al. 2019 ).",

The inhomogeneity of these heavy isotopes in Solar System meteorites may be driven from where the protoplanetary material, which makes up the meteorites, originates (Dauphas et al. 2010;Lugaro et al. 2016;Ek et al. 2020). In conjunction with this observation, massive planets are commonly known to migrate inwards towards their host stars, and form on faster timescales than terrestrial planets (Pollack et al. 1996;Chambers & Wetherill 1998). Therefore, giant planets should sample the protoplanetary material used in the formation of terrestrial planets as they migrate, leading to the postulation that there could be a coupling of the inhomogeneity trend with the Jupiter-mass planet's atmosphere. Furthermore, Mel\u00e9ndez et al. (2009) noted that the Sun, as compared to solar twins, is depleted in several refractory elements -elements with a high condensation temperaturesuch as yttrium and barium. The possibility that planet formation imprints chemical signatures on the host star is an active area of research, where differences in observed stellar abundance trends with condensation temperature are likely associated with the histories of planet formation (e.g. Booth & Owen 2020;Liu et al. 2020Liu et al. , 2021)). Additionally, Kruijer et al. (2017) show that measurements of heavy elements have proven to be a useful tool in determining the age of Jupiter, which is directly linked to the age of the Sun.",

            "text": "We use an extensive suite of numerical simulations to constrain the mass and orbit of Planet Nine, the recently proposed perturber in a distant eccentric orbit in the outer solar system. We compare our simulations to the observed population of aligned eccentric high semimajor axis Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and determine which simulation parameters are statistically compatible with the observations. We find that only a narrow range of orbital elements can reproduce the observations. In particular, the combination of semimajor axis, eccentricity, and mass of Planet Nine strongly dictates the semimajor axis range of the orbital confinement of the distant eccentric KBOs. Allowed orbits, which confine KBOs with semimajor axis beyond 380 au, have perihelia roughly between 150 and 350 au, semimajor axes between 380 and 980 au, and masses between 5 and 20 Earth masses. Orbitally confined objects also generally have orbital planes similar to that of the planet, suggesting that the planet is inclined approximately 30\u00b0to the ecliptic. We compare the allowed orbital positions and estimated brightness of Planet Nine to previous and ongoing surveys which would be sensitive to the planet\u2019s detection and use these surveys to rule out approximately two-thirds of the planet\u2019s orbit. Planet Nine is likely near aphelion with an approximate brightness of 22 < V < 25 . At opposition, its motion, mainly due to parallax, can easily be detected within 24 hours.",

            "text": "How the planets sizes are ordered and distributed is likely a direct result of the how the planets formed and evolved. For example, Mars, being the only terrestrial planet in our Solar System that does not follow the sequential planet size distribution, may be a direct result of the formation and migration of Jupiter, inwards and then back outwards leaving a truncated and depleted inner disk out of which Mars was formed (Walsh et al. 2011). Lissauer et al. (2011b) noted, for adjacent planets within the Kepler multiple-candidate systems, that the distribution of radii ratios for adjacent planets is symmetrically centered around unity, but hints of a planetary size hierarchy can be seen in multi-planet systems discovered by Kepler. Kepler-11, which has 6 transiting planets (Lissauer et al. 2011a) with the smallest planets residing preferentially inside the orbits of larger planets. Kepler-11 displays an anti-correlation between the mean density of the planets and the semi-major axis distance from the host star; i.e., the larger and lower density planets are located further out than the smaller and denser planets, possibly indicative of the formation and/or evolution of the planetary system (Migaszewski et al. 2012). Kepler-47, the only known circumbinary multiple planet system, also displays a size hierarchy with the inner planet (\u223c 3R \u2295 ) being smaller than the outer planet (\u223c 4.6R \u2295 ; Orosz et al. 2012). Yet, in Kepler-20 (a 5planet system), the relative sizes of the planets do not appear to correlate with the orbital periods of the planets (Gautier et al. 2012;Fressin et al. 2012). But these are only three systems. Is there an overall correlation of planetary size with orbital period? \n\nHere we explore the relative sizes of the planetary radii for all planet pairs within the multiple candidate systems discovered thus far by Kepler (Batalha et al. 2012).",

The dot on the physical quantities signifies the derivative with respect to time. The initial values of these quantities can be estimated from the DE200 ephemeris (Standish (1990)). Unfortunately, I can't compare the perihelion advance rate measured via \u03c0 with my own calculations, as PA has been defined differently in my work. \n\nOur calculations of the partial contribution of each planet in solar system to the PA of each inner planet, using proposed two different methods, are in good agreement with those provided by Clemence (1947). It is noteworthy also that the PA of the Earth and Mars show an average linear trend over the 900-year calculation time interval. It is also worth mentioning other results on the partial contributions of solar system planets on the PA of inner planets (in Loskutov (2011) one can find the PA of Mercury and Earth, in Amelkin (2019) one can find the PA of Mercury), which give values consistent with those reported by Clemence (1947) for the PA of Mercury and Earth. \n\nFrom now on, I extend the solar system model to include the hypothetical planet Vulcan, thus solving the problem of N=10 bodies. The calculations in the presence of Vulcan are carried out for the two sets of orbital parameter values for the latter planet, the Le Verrier set and the optimized set of Pogossian (2023) computed by the second method only , i.e., calculating the PA of one of the inner planets in the presence and absence of Vulcan, and then evaluating Table 2. In this table, the PA (in angular seconds per century: \u2032\u2032 /cy) of inner planets is calculated in the absence of one of the solar system's perturbing planets (the absence is obtained by reducing the perturbing planet's size to 1 kg).",

            "text": "Since the first discovery of an extrasolar planet in 1992, the search and exploration of exoplanets is a fast-growing field of research. It is assumed that one important requirement for life is liquid water on the planetary surface, which is fulfilled in a certain distance range around a star called \"the habitable zone\". A rocky planet has to stay long enough in the habitable zone that life can evolve and survive. In a system with multiple planets these planets can potentially interact with each other. This can lead to periods of instability and chaos, which could be very destructive for terrestrial planets in the habitable zone. Until now, many extrasolar gas giants with high eccentricities have been discovered, which indicates that dynamical instabilities in planetary systems may be common. To explore the dynamical past of a planetary system, the system has to be simulated with specified initial conditions. \n\nMany N-body simulations of planetary systems have been modelled yet. The so-called \"Nice Model\" is the most established model of our solar system. Tsiganis and Morbidelli (2005) modelled the past of the four giant planets of the solar system to explain among other things the today's eccentricities and inclinations of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune as well as many objects of the Kuiper belt. They found out that a compact, circular and co-planar configuration of the planets result in strong planet-planetesimal scattering and migration. After this phase of instability the outcome matches well the today's architecture of the outer solar system. Similar simulations were made by Chambers and Kaib (2015). They additionally considered the evolution of terrestrial embryos and planets during the Nice Model starting with five and six giant planets. The results show that the possibility exists that one or two originally giant planets in our solar system could be ejected by strong gravitational scattering leaving the solar system in its current configuration. Several authors have simulated known extrasolar planetary systems. Chambers et al. (2000) investigated the stability of orbits of terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of the four known systems Rho CrB, 47UMa, Gliese 876 and Ups And. For this purpose one or two hypothetical terrestrial planets were placed in the habitable zone and the whole system was integrated for 10 8 \u2212 10 9 years to analyse the orbital stability.",

The final number of embryos per planetary system is strongly dependent on the initial disc profile and migration rate assumed.\n\nPlanetary systems analogous to our Solar system are preferentially formed in massive discs, in a high-metallicity environment and where the disc profile that defines the gas and solid density in the inner disc is small. In addition, it also requires that the migration rate is not too fast, in order to avoid the planets being pushed towards the inner edge of the disc. We found solar systems with more than one giant planet, even with three, but in no case with more than three giant planets.\n\nAssuming the sharpest disc profile, characterized by the largest value of \u03b3 assumed in this work, implies that the solids are accumulated in the inner regions of the disc, while they fall rapidly beyond the characteristic radius of the disc. This accumulation in the inner disc favours the formation of hot Jupiter planets, which are preferably formed in very massive discs combined with a slow depletion of the gas and a metal-rich environment. Also a fast migration rate is required in order to form these systems. According to our results, most of the hot and warm Jupiter systems are composed of only one giant planet, which is also shown by the current observational data.\n\nWe did not find any planetary system with giant planets located farther than 30 au, which is a consequence of the scenario assumed for giant planet formation.\n\nWe also analysed which are the most favourable environments for the formation of low-mass, potentially habitable planets and found that they are preferably formed in planetary systems analogous to our Solar system and also in low-mass planetary systems, which are the best environments for the development of these systems.",

            "text": "But upon thinking about it, I became convinced that it offered a plausible mechanism for moving Neptune outward. \n\nOne could now postulate that Pluto had formed in a nearly circular, nearly coplanar orbit in the natal solar system's disk, just like the other planets, but had been swept by Neptune's exterior 3:2 orbital resonance as Neptune migrated outward: the subsequent migration would naturally lead to Pluto's eccentric resonant orbit. Moreover, Pluto's measured orbital eccentricity provided a lower limit on the magnitude of Neptune's outward radial migration (of at least \u223c5 au). And, by conservation of energy and angular momentum principles, it was also possible to infer the magnitude of the inward migration of Jupiter and of the mass of the planetesimal disk needed to fuel the migration of the giant planets. All of these quantitative estimates did not seem outright implausible, so I wrote up this idea in a short paper (Malhotra 1993), followed up with another paper (Malhotra 1995) to flesh out some predictions of such planet migration on the dynamical structure of the Kuiper Belt which had just been discovered (Jewitt & Luu 1993). \n\nI suppose the timing was just right, because the idea of planet migration was then very quickly and widely accepted as a new paradigm for the origin and evolution of the Solar system. It is probably no exaggeration to state that that insight in Fernandez & Ip (1984) has transformed almost all aspects of planetary science in the past 25 years. \n\nIn the present contribution, I will discuss some new developments in outer solar system studies: the possibility of unseen planets yet to be discovered. Let me start by noting that our ancestors many millennia ago recognized five planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn). When William Herschel and Caroline Herschel discovered a new planet in 1781 CE, a planet unknown to the ancients, subsequently named Uranus, the discovery truly opened human imagination to the possibility of more planets. Uranus was discovered serendipitously, in the dawn of the age of telescopes. The next new planet, Neptune, was a planet that was predicted, motivated by mathematical calculations based on Neptune's theory of gravity which revealed anomalies in the orbital motion of the planet Uranus.",

            "text": "To study the dependence of the Planet Nine hypothesis on the initial conditions of the Kuiper Belt, we explore the evolution of two initially distinct Kuiper Belt distributions. Our choice of distributions is motivated by the proposed mechanisms for Planet Nine's formation. The first population, the \"narrow\" Kuiper Belt (q\uf0a0\u00e4\uf0a0 [30,36]), corresponds to the conventional definition of the scattering disk (Gladman et al. 2008). The second \"broad\" population (q\uf0a0\u00e4\uf0a0 [30,300]) is associated with mechanisms involving stellar encounters, which could lift the perihelion distance of both Planet Nine and the KBOs. In the scattering or capture scenarios, then, the Kuiper Belt q-distribution may range from Neptune's semimajor axis all the way to Planet Nine's perihelion distance and further.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, we begin our study of the evolution of these two populations by employing an idealized numerical model. We carry out two sets of N-body simulations that span 4 Gyr of integration time and utilize the mercury6 software package (Chambers 1999), employing the hybrid Wisdom-Holman/Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm.\n\nAs a first step, we consider a simplified planar model of the solar system, which includes Neptune and Planet Nine as active bodies, but replaces Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus with a solar J 2 moment as in Batygin & Brown (2016a). That is, we account for the gravitational potential of the three planets by adding a nonzero quadrupolar field to the Sun and extending its radius to Uranus' semimajor axis. In this semi-averaged model, we introduce a 10 m \u2295 Planet Nine with semimajor axis a 9 \uf0a0=\uf0a0700 au, eccentricity e 9 \uf0a0=\uf0a00.6, and inclination i 9 \uf0a0=\uf0a00\u00b0, and set the time step to 16 years (one-tenth of Neptune's orbital period).\n\nWhile capture of Planet Nine by the solar system is unlikely to impulsively perturb the Kuiper Belt in any appreciable manner, the same is not necessarily true if Planet Nine attained its initial long-period orbit by scattering off of Jupiter or Saturn.

Unless the process took place during the genesis of the solar system in which case the companion stars of the sun might be very, very far away. \n\nThe hypothesis of a ninth planet is still debated and will remain so until NP is discovered. It has been argued that the orbits of some Sednitos have been wrongly estimated, thereby weakening the reason to invoke NP at all. [Shankman et al., 2017]; although recent results tend to agree with the presence of a ninth planet [de la Fuente Marcos et al. 2017] There is also the scenario where all Sednitos were captured by the sun during a close encounter with a star and its own planets [Jilkova et al., 2015]. Batygin & Morbidelli (2017) have studied the possibility that some distant KO be trapped in some resonances with NP while Sheppard & Trujillo (2016) note that correlations among several extreme eccentric objects is further evidence of a distant massive planet. The discovery of 2015BP519 [Becker et al., 2018] was seen as further proof of its existence because it can produce objects with orbits highly inclined with respect to the global orbital plane. Recent work however [de la Fuente Marcos et al., 2018b] warns of some caution when using 2015BP519 as further proof of the existence of PN because it appears as a statistical outlier. \n\nRecently, a cosmic messenger has been discovered: Oumuamua.

Its discovery is taken as a clue that such objects must be fairly common (at least not so rare) in interstellar space.",

            "text": "The past few years have seen a flood of newly discovered exoplanets. Currently, almost 2000 confirmed exoplanets are known 1 . Exoplanetary systems show a wide range of architectures that can vary radically from our solar system. For example, the so-called hot Jupiters are Jupiter-mass exoplanets orbiting very close to their host star (often closer than Mercury orbits the Sun). Super-Earths are exoplanets more massive than Earth, but significantly less massive than the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. While absent from the solar system, Super-Earths are common around other stars (Fressin et al. 2013;Petigura et al. 2013). Another class of planets absent in the solar system are massive planets in wide orbits, as in the HR 8799 system that hosts four massive, directly imaged planets with semi-major axis 2 between 14.5 and 68 AU. In general, current data suggest that stars hosting planets are the rule rather than the exception. From statistical analysis of microlensing data, Cassan et al. (2012) find that each star in the Galaxy should have more than one planet on average (in the orbital range 0.5-10 AU). From an astrobiological viewpoint, a relevant quantity is the fraction of stars with planets in the habitable zone. Petigura et al. (2013) estimate that 8.6% of the Sun-like stars host an Earth-like planet (1-2 R \u2295 ) in the habitable zone as defined by Kopparapu et al. (2013). Assuming that the planet formation efficiency is the same throughout the Milky Way, this results in a huge number of potentially habitable planets. If life exists on one of these planets, can we detect it? In contrast to the solar system, the only possibility to do so is by using remote observations. This is the topic of the next chapter, which will set paper IV into context. In the solar system, it is possible to search for traces of past or present life in situ. However, for exoplanets, we rely on remote observations. In this chapter, I give a brief overview of ideas to remotely detect life.

            "text": "We recently identified the two most unusual aspects of our solar system (compared with all of the observed exoplanetary systems): (1) the lack of super-Earths (planets with a mass in the range -\u00c5 M 1 10 , e.g., Valencia et al. 2007) and (2) the lack of planets inside of Mercury's orbit (Martin & Livio 2015). More than half of the observed Sun-like stars in the solar neighborhood have one or more super-Earth planets on low eccentricity orbits with periods of days to months (Mayor et al. 2011;Batalha et al. 2013;Fressin et al. 2013;Burke et al. 2015). This is in contrast to our solar system, which is depleted in mass in this region. To examine potential reasons for this difference, in this work we consider formation processes for super-Earths and investigate the conditions in the solar nebula that could have affected the outcome for our solar system.\n\nThe timeline for the formation of the planets in our solar system is thought to have been as follows. The planetesimals formed within a few million years of the birth of the Sun (Connelly et al. 2012). The giant planets formed quickly allowing for the accretion of material from the gas disk (e.g., Alibert et al. 2005). However, the terrestrial planets formed long after the gas disk was dispersed on a timescale of around 10-100 million years (e.g., Kenyon & Bromley 2006). There are no super-Earths in our solar system, so understanding their formation on the basis of solar system data alone is more difficult.\n\nThe observed close-in super-Earths exhibit a wide range of densities (e.g., Wolfgang & Laughlin 2012;Howe et al. 2014;Knutson et al. 2014;Marcy et al. 2014a), suggesting that there may be several different mechanisms for their formation (see also Figure 5 in Martin & Livio 2015).

            "text": "As a result, long-term stability is not guaranteed. \n\nThe possible instability of the terrestrial planets on a timescale of a few Gyr shows that the solar system has not yet finished evolving dynamically. Its overall structure can still change in the future, even if marginally within the remaining main-sequence lifetime of the Sun. \n\nThis potential change in the orbital structure of the planets would not be the first one in the history of the solar system. In fact, several aspects of the current orbital architecture of the solar system suggest that the planetary orbits changed quite drastically after the epoch of planet formation and the disappearence of the proto-planetary disk of gas. For instance, as described above, the giant planets are not in mean motion resonance with each other. However, their early interaction with the disk of gas in which they formed could have driven them into mutual meanmotion resonances such as the 1:2, 2:3 or 3:4, where the orbital separations are much narrower than the current ones (Lee and Peale 2002; Kley et al. 2005;Morbidelli et al. 2007). We do indeed observe many resonant configurations among extra-solar planetary systems, and in numerical simulations of planetary migration. Also, the current eccentricities and inclinations of the giant planets of the solar system, even if smaller than those of many extra-solar planets, are nevertheless non-zero. In a disk of gas, without any mean-motion resonant interaction, the damping effects would have annihilated the eccentricities and inclinations of the giant planets in a few hundred orbits (Kley and Dirksen 2006;Cresswell et al. 2007). So, some mechanism must have extracted the giant planets from any original mean-motion resonances and placed them onto their current, partially eccentric and inclined orbits, after gas removal. \n\nThe populations of small bodies of the solar system also attest to significant changes in the aftermath of gas removal, and possibly several 100 Myr later. The existence and properties of these populations thus provide important constraints on our dynamical history (e.g., see Section 6). There are three main reservoirs of small bodies: the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the Kuiper belt immediately beyond Neptune and the Oort cloud at the outskirts of the solar system.",

In this letter, we investigate the potential of the recently proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission 1 to constrain the sky position, distance and mass of a hypothetical P9 by examining the ranging data of its radio link with Earth. A plausible mission trajectory is depicted in Figure 1, in which the spacecraft undergoes a Jupiter Gravity Assist before entering a 9 year cruise phase to the Uranian system. In particular, our goals are to provide a proof-of-concept of the trajectory reconstruction method detailed in Section 2 and to estimate the mission's sky localisation accuracy as a function of the ranging noise and data collection frequency in Section 3. This letter is a companion piece to the previous works highlighting the scientific potential of collecting ranging data throughout the long cruise time of a prospective Uranus mission (hereafter denoted as PUM), which includes the possible detection of gravitational waves in the mHz frequency range (Soyuer et al. 2021, hereafter S21) as well as constraints on the dark matter content in the solar system (Zwick et al. 2022, hereafter Z22). \n\n\u2605 E-mail: jozef.bucko@uzh.ch 1 Survey provided in: Origins, Worlds, and Life: A Decadal Strategy for Planetary Science and Astrobiology 2023-2032 (2022)",

            "text": "It is believed on theoretical grounds that terrestrial planets are commonly formed near their central stars and that it is unlikely to have a gaseous giant form closer to the center than about 4 AU (Boss 1995). Accordingly, our solar system is presumed to be typical of planetary systems around other stars. On the other hand, most of the extrasolar planets found to date do not fit in this theoretical picture. The currently available sample of extrasolar planets is strongly biased toward giant planets because small perturbing masses cannot be easily resolved by observations, so it is understood that it will take more time before large extrasolar systems comparable to our own can be detected. Nevertheless, there is presently no doubt that in many extrasolar systems, a large number of massive planets exist very close to their stars (the trail of discovery started with the planet at 0.05 AU in 51 Peg found by Mayor & Queloz [1995] and the planet at 0.48 AU in 70 Vir found by Marcy & Butler [1996]). This discrepancy seems to point to the hypothesis that the cores of these planets have formed farther away and that the objects have migrated inward to the observationally inferred distances (Kary & Lissauer 1995;Lin, Bodenheimer, & Richardson 1996), perhaps destroying in the process the orbits of terrestrial planets that could have existed closer to central stars. \n\nMigrating giant planets cannot be accounted for in our model, so we will have to wait until observations can detect some large extrasolar systems similar to our own. However, two small multiple-planet systems have already been detected which are different than our solar system, but their planetary distributions appear to be more in line with a sequence of well-ordered density peaks as predicted by our model. These systems are 55 Cancri (Fischer et al. 2008) and HD 37124 (Vogt et al. 2005). Using updated data from the \"Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets\" (http://exoplanets.org",

We find that the majority of systems have low \uf051, indicating that planets within a system tend to be the same size. Among the few systems with large \uf051, many also have high values of \u03bc, which is to be expected based on the definition of \uf051. Conversely, we find few planets with large \uf051 but low \u03bc, indicating that if giant planets do form, runaway gas accretion occurs unequally between planets in a system. because it can only take a few discrete values for small N and thus is not on its own flexible enough to describe the apparent size ordering of planets. Note that \uf04d is normalized to the range (\u22121, 1) and has the same qualitative interpretation as \u03c1 S . Kipping (2018) performed an in-depth study of planet size ordering and argued that based on the solar system, consideration of size ordering should not be restricted to a single monotonic trend. Rather, because the solar system planets (mostly) increase in size up to Jupiter and then decrease in size thereafter, a two-part trend best captures the high degree of apparent size ordering in the solar system, whereas a one-part trend would indicate no size ordering. However, because the sample of planets considered in our present work is dominated by three-and four-planet systems, we restrict ourselves to a single-component treatment of monotonicity. In the future, should sufficient very high-multiplicity (N\uf0a0\uf0a05) systems be discovered, the two component treatment advocated for by Kipping (2018) should then be revisited.\n\nWe find that 72% of high-multiplicity (N\uf0a0\uf0a03) systems have > \uf04d 0, strengthening the finding of Weiss et al. (2018) that 65% of planet pairs are ordered with the larger planet exterior to the smaller planet. In addition, while the smallest observed negative monotonicity value is = -\uf04d 0.67, there are five systems that have at least equally strong positive monotonicity > + \uf04d 0.67. Similarly, although there are only two systems with < -\uf04d 0.5, there are 16 systems with > + \uf04d 0.5. In Section 5, we investigate whether this apparent size ordering is physical in nature or the result of observational biases. The distribution of \uf04d is shown in Figure 8.",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that the planetary systems, and particularly our Solar System, were not formed in an in-situ scenario. On the contrary, these planets underwent a substantial migration of their orbits. This migration may have different origins, such as interactions with a gaseous (Goldreich and Tremaine, 1979;Goldreich and Tremaine, 1980) or planetesimal (Fernandez and Ip, 1984) disk. The presence of these structures imply that the migration must have taken place in the early Solar System. Nevertheless, the actual path of each planet still remains as an open question. One of the models explaining this process is the Jumping-Jupiter model (Morbidelli et al., 2009), where the young Solar System contains 5 giant planets. These planets migrate through interaction with a planetesimal disk and becomes unstable, and due to this instability, the four giant planets present nowadays have encounters with the fifth one, acquiring orbits similar to the ones we observe in the present and ejecting the remaining one. Besides explaining the orbital characteristics of the giant planets, this model have been successfully applied to explain the origin of many small bodies population in our Solar System (Nesvorn\u00fd et al., 2013;Brasil et al., 2014;Deienno et al., 2014;Nesvorn\u00fd et al., 2014), as well as the Late Heavy Bombardment (Deienno et al., 2017). On the other side, the constraints given by the observations of the present Solar System impose a large number of conditions to be met by the results of simulations to be considered as successful, which make this model unlikely (Nesvorn\u00fd and Morbidelli, 2012).\n\nAlthough a model of capture in co-orbital motion in the frame of the Jumping-Jupiter scenario (i.e., involving the encounter of Jupiter with an ice giant) has been proposed (Nesvorn\u00fd et al., 2013), we pose the hypothesis that a population of planetesimals could be captured in the co-orbital region of the migrating planet before the instability, when the capture could be assisted by the drag force exerted on the planetesimals by the gaseous disk. In a subsequent stage, the particles captured as Trojans can transform their orbits into quasi-satellites, which in turn enables them to have close encounters",

This class of planet seems to be present around the majority of main sequence stars (e.g. Howard et al. 2012a;Fressin et al. 2013a;Petigura et al. 2013a) but no such planet exists in our inner Solar System. Given that most exoplanetary systems look dramatically different than our own, should we expect those planets to have formed in the same ways as our own terrestrial planets, or by completely different processes?\n\nIn this article we review terrestrial planet formation in the Solar System and around other stars. We discuss the dynamical processes that shaped the inner Solar System and our understanding of different formation pathways that can explain the orbital architectures of exoplanet systems. We present a path toward understanding how our Solar System fits in the larger context of exoplanets, and how exoplanets themselves can be used to improve our understanding of our own Solar System. Any successful model of Solar System formation must explain why Mars is so much smaller than Earth and why the asteroid belt is so low in mass yet dynamically excited. There are currently two models that can explain the inner Solar System. Likewise, any successful model for the formation of super-Earths must match the observed distributions (e.g., the period ratio distribution). We will discuss the relationships between super-Earths and true 'terrestrial planets', which are likely far more different than one may expect based solely on their observed sizes/masses. We will also discuss why the Solar System is particularly outstanding in its lack hot super-Earths inside Mercury's orbit.\n\nThis review is organized as follows. We first briefly discuss the early stages of planet formation, from dust to planetesimals. Next we review the late stage of accretion of terrestrial planets focusing on the Solar System. We discuss the numerical tools used to study terrestrial planet formation, the ingredients for such simulations and specific Solar System constraints on those simulations. We present different views for the origin of the inner Solar System and possible ways to discriminate different models, concluding the section with a brief discussion of the long-",

Yet, solar system analogues 1 have not been detected, and we therefore still do not know if our own planetary system is unique or not. Detecting Earth twins is still not possible, and requires major on-going research to correct for stellar activity with radial velocity (RV) techniques at the appropriate level (Meunier & Lagrange 2019). Also, detecting Jupiter twins orbiting at 5 au is very challenging (and not possible at larger separations) with radial velocity because decade(s) of careful monitoring are needed, and long term stellar activity is also responsible for a long term noise. As a consequence, the orbital parameters of thestill rare -RV planets announced beyond 5 au are poorly characterized (Wittenmyer et al. (2016), Fernandes et al. (2019), Fulton et al. (2021)).

            "text": "Kepler's discovery of multiple compact, coplanar systems of multi-transiting sub-Neptune planets has sparked renewed interest in planet formation theory. Kepler found 261 systems with three or more transiting planet candidates, and 92 with four or more transiting planets (retrieved from http:// exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu). Most of these planets, super-Earths to sub-Neptunes, are in a size range that is absent from the solar system, as are their remarkably compact configurations. Systems like Kepler-11, with six planets having orbital periods well under that of Venus (Lissauer et al. 2011a), highlight the difference between what appears common in other systems and our own solar system.\n\nThe debate over how these systems formed has, to a certain extent, given rise to two competing paradigms, invoking either the migration of multiplanet systems to close-in orbits (Izidoro et al. 2015) or in situ formation determined by local conditions (Chiang & Laughlin 2013;Hansen & Murray 2013;Petrovich et al. 2013). Much of the discussion has occurred in the context of interpreting the period-ratio distribution of planet pairs, which is one of the major planet population observables delivered by the Kepler mission.\n\nThe period-ratio distribution of Kepler's multi-transiting planets has narrow valleys and peaks near first-order mean motion resonances over an otherwise smooth distribution (Lissauer et al. 2011b;Fabrycky et al. 2014;Malhotra 2015;Steffen & Hwang 2015). Generally, the assembly of resonances is thought to result from convergent migration and resonant trapping, followed by migration while maintaining constant orbital period ratios. This explains the preponderance of orbital period ratios near 2:1 or 3:2. However, closer orbital period ratios require either initial formation at a small orbital period ratio or a mechanism to avoid or escape from the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances. Furthermore, the migration of planets and resonant trapping leads to the expectation that the majority of multiplanet systems should end up in resonance or even in resonant chains, although that does not seem to be the case . In fact, just narrow of first-order resonances, the period-ratio",

But in recent years, it has become a true science, thanks in part to new developments in the search for Earth-like planets outside our own solar system. A new era in scienti1\u20442c discovery was initiated in 1995 with the announcement, by the Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, of the 1\u20442rst Jupitermass companion to a Sun-like star. Progress on the detection of planets outside our solar system has occurred at a breathtaking pace ever since; scarcely a month goes by without a new revelation of some sort or another. Already well over a hundred extrasolar planet candidates have been announced, and the pace of discovery promises to quicken as additional ground-based search programs swing into action. Meanwhile a number of powerful space-based observatories speci1\u20442cally designed to search for and characterize planets as small in mass as Earth are being planned for the next two decades. These advances have fueled, in turn, furious theoretical work on the formation and migration mechanisms of planets inside and outside our solar system. All the extrasolar planets discovered to date appear to be gas giant planets, similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and the theory of gas giant planet formation is in flux as a result. The amazingly short period of the 1\u20442rst extrasolar, Jupiter-mass planet discovered brought the possibility of planet migration to the attention of theorists. The extrasolar planet orbits its host star, 51 Pegasi, in a mere 4.23 days, compared to Jupiter\u2019s leisurely 11.9-year orbit around the Sun\u2013and, according to Kepler\u2019s third law, it orbits 51 Pegasi about a hundred times closer than Jupiter orbits the Sun. The formation of a Jupiter-mass planet so close to its parent star appears to be dif1\u20442cult, if not impossible, so theorists such as myself have hypothesized that some giant planets must form at larger distances and then migrate inward to their 1\u20442nal orbital distances. There are two very different ideas for how gas giant planets might form. Most astronomers favor the conventional theory of core accretion, where a solid core forms 1\u20442rst and",

            "text": "The discovery of planets orbiting other stars has led to an ongoing revolution in our understanding of the origins of planets and their system architectures. In addition to spawning theories about the evolution of these distant systems, this has also led to new insights regarding the formation of the planets in our own Solar system. Perhaps the biggest change with regards to classical theories of planet origin is the appreciation that the early evolution of a planetary system is far more dynamic than originally believed, and that the current positions of planets need not indicate the original location of the material from which they formed. \n\nIn the case of our own Solar system, we benefit from an amount of observational detail that is not feasible to obtain in other systems. One aspect of this is that we can observe even relatively small satellites of the planets in our Solar system, whose origins must therefore be incorporated into the formation scheme. Viewed in this light, the variation in the satellite systems of the Terrestrial planets is striking, given that all the planets are believed to be broadly the result of the same collisional accumulation process (e.g. Stevenson, Harris & Lunine 1986). Mercury and Venus possess no known long-term moons, and the moons of Mars -Phobos and Deimos -are much smaller (\u223c 10 \u22123 in mass) than that of the Earth. Thus, it appears as though satellite formation does not scale simply with planet mass. \n\n\u22c6 E-mail:hansenastro.ucla.edu Indeed, it was initially hypothesized that Phobos and Deimos were captured asteroids (Singer 1968;Smith 1970). This point of view is supported by their irregular, cratered, shapes, low densities, and the similarity of their colours with those of outer main belt asteroids (Christensen et al. 1977;Tolson et al. 1978;Duxbury & Veverka 1978;Pang et al. 1978;Pollack et al. 1978;Pajola et al. 2013;Fraeman et al. 2014). On the other hand, their orbits are almost circular, and lie close to the equatorial mid-plane of the planet, suggesting that substantial dissipation is required to produce the current dynamical configuration.",

            "text": "A natural application of our angular momentum study is to determine the invariable plane of the solar system. Souami & Souchay (2012) showed that the inclusion of Pluto and Ceres is essential to calculate the orientation of the invariable plane. Considering the more important contributions of the other three dwarf planets to the total angular momentum of the minor planets, a further examination of this plane is necessary. \n\nIn order to evaluate and update the orientation of the solar system's invariable plane, we take into account the additional effects of: (1) the three dwarf planets Eris, Haumea, and Makemake; (2) the numerous nominal samples with assigned masses from our database. Here, the invariable plane is defined by the total angular momentum of the Sun, the eight planets, and a certain minor planet population. \n\nThe inclination i m and the ascending node \u2126 m of the invariable plane is computed in the barycentric frame referred to the J2000.0 ecliptic plane, at the epoch of 2016 November 8. For comparison, we firstly re-did the measurements of i m and \u2126 m for the two systems considered in Souami & Souchay (2012): one is a basic system (I) that consists of the Sun, the eight planets, and Pluto; the other is a more complete system (II), to which the three MBAs Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are added. The results are shown in the top two rows of Table 4. We observe that the inclination difference \u2206i m between systems I and II is 9.35 mas, which tallies well with the value of 9.14 mas reported in Souami & Souchay (2012). Over the 100 yr interval in our numerical integrations, the variation of i m is on the order of 10 \u22129 mas. Then the \u223c 0.21 mas difference in \u2206i m probably arises from the initial conditions of Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta in the ASTORB file. Nevertheless, comparing to the absolute value of \u2206i m , this magnitude of the difference is sufficiently small, and the validity of our calculation procedure has been verified.",

Moons orbit planets of all types of planets in our solar system: large gas giants, small rocky planets, and of course Earth-like planets. With the 5312 exoplanets discovered to date (Nasa Exoplanet Archive Akeson et al. (2013), queried 03/27/2023), we have discovered not a single exomoon, with only one identified exomoon candidate (Kipping et al. 2022). This gives an astonishingly low occurrence rate of \u223c0% for moons orbiting planets outside our solar system, hot Jupiters and Super-Earths alike. It is natural to wonder: where are the exomoons? \n\nWhile the Earth is the only habitable planet in our solar system presently, it is possible that in the past both Mars and Venus were habitable as well. Of these planets that could have been habitable, life developed on at least one of these three-and potentially 2 (Azua-Bustos et al. 2023). This gives a lower limit on the occurance rate of habitable planets developing life as 33%. There's an estimated 500 million habitable planets in our galaxy alone, yet there has been no discoveries of life, intelligent or bacterial, beyond our solar system (Sheikh et al. 2023). This discrepancy is most famously stated through the Fermi-paradox: if intelligent life is likely to exist throughout the universe, why have we not discovered any trace of it? \n\nWe expect both exomoons and life to be nearly as common in our galaxy as exoplanets themselves, yet we find no evidence of either. Coincidence? We think not. \n\nCorresponding author: Casey L. Brinkman clbrinkm@hawaii.edu \n\nIn this paper we explore the ways in which the dearth of these two discoveries could be explained by the same natural phenomenon: Moonfall.",

Indeed, as well the observed distribution of the whole system as that of the inner system (which stands globally as the first orbital of the outer one) agree with the predicted law of probability density. We can therefore use the hierarchical model described above to predict the masses of the planets (in units of Jupiter mass, as in runaway models). The result is given in Fig. 4. The distributions of the mass of planets in the inner and outer solar system are in good agreement with such a model. Only the mass of Neptune is much higher than expected. But even this discrepancy is easily explained by the existence of a larger system in which the mass peak of the whole planetary system (i.e. Jupiter) ranks n = 1, and in which Neptune ranks n = 2 (dashed line in Fig. 4; see also Fig. 3). \n\nRemark finally that this model will certainly help solving another problem encountered by standard models of planetary formation. The accretion time of planetesimals, though acceptable for earth-like planets, becomes too large for giant planets. In our framework, the initial distribution of planetesimals is no longer flat, but already peaked at about the final value of the planet positions, which should shorten the accretion process. \n\nFigure 4: Comparison between the observed and theoretically predicted planet masses in the inner and outer solar system.

            "text": "Finally, we investigate the correlation between the ability of our systems to form accurate Mercury analogs and their success in terms of the other three terrestrial planets. While there are numerous ways in which we might constrain our Venus-Earth-Mars systems, we focus on the planets' respective masses and semimajor axes to avoid overconstraining our simulations. Moreover, our selected initial disk configuration of a narrow annulus is highly successful at replicating the low orbital eccentricities and inclinations of the terrestrial planets (Hansen 2009; Walsh & Levison 2016;Clement et al. 2019b;Lykawka 2020). Therefore, we adopt a similar classification scheme to the one proposed in Clement et al. (2018). Criterion E requires that a system form exactly two planets with m > 0.6 M \u2295 and a < 1.3 au, and exactly one Mars analog with 0.05 < m < 0.3 M \u2295 and a > 1.3 au (approximately equal to Mars' modern perihelion). This ensures that Earth and Venus are more massive than Mars by at least a factor of 2. Therefore, a system satisfying both criteria A and E necessarily contains analogs of all four terrestrial planets (albeit not necessarily an adequate Mercury analog in terms of criteria B and C). While this scheme obviously classifies some systems that are not exact solar system analogs as successful, we find it to be an adequate prescription for analyzing how our results for Mercury depend on the properties of the other three planets. As with our CMF calculation, we experimented with several alternative classification schemes and found that the overall trends are not particularly dependent on the precise methodology utilized.",

            "text": "In Figure 10, we show the regions of the potential orbits of Planet Nine that have been ruled out by the above constraints (or, in the case of the ongoing DES and final Pan-STARRS analysis, where the planet might still be found by these surveys). The existence of Planet Nine can be ruled out over about two-thirds of its orbit. The vast majority of the orbital region in which Planet Nine could be located is beyond about 700 au and within about 60\u00b0of its aphelion position. For the eccentric orbits considered here, Planet Nine spends greater than half of its time at these distances, so finding it currently at these locations near aphelion would be expected. At its most distant allowed location and with a Neptune-like albedo, a 20 R e Planet Nine is approximately V = 25. While faint, such an object would be well within the limits of 10 m class telescopes.",

            "text": "In contrast, the reflected light is detected in the V band, which is most sensitive to the planet distance from the Sun. For an inefficient heat transport in the interior, possibly as in Uranus, we found that the object could be much dimmer in the Q band by 6 to 9 magnitudes, making it much harder to detect at long wavelengths. The V magnitude, in contrast, is only very mildly increased by about 0.3 mag. This means that the ratio of the brightness in the visual and in the mid-and far-IR constrains the nature of the object. \n\nWe found that the evolution of the planet interior is almost identical for a semimajor axis of 5 to 1120 AU, meaning that the moment when the planet arrived at its distant position from the Sun is difficult to constrain from the current intrinsic luminosity. An early ejection during the nebular phase at ages of less than 10 Myr could be preferable from a dynamics point of view because the gaseous nebula could then enable the retention of the object on a far bound orbit (Batygin & Brown 2016). On the other hand, for such an early ejection, the planet might be lost due to stellar encounters in the solar birth cluster (Li & Adams 2016). Insights into the planet origin and formation history might be obtained from its chemical composition or spectrum. \n\nMany surveys in various wavelength domains and with different sensitivities were performed in the past. For example, Trujillo & Brown (2003) observed 12% of the sky near the invariable plane in the R band with a sensitivity limit of 20.7 mag. Candidate Planet 9 is most of the time fainter than 22 mag in the R band (Fig. 2), however, and additionally, it is assumed to have an inclination of i = 30 \u2022 (Batygin & Brown 2016). This means that Trujillo & Brown (2003) had only a very slight possibility of detecting candidate Planet 9. Another study was done by Elliot et al. (2005), who observed the sky within 6 \u2022 of the ecliptic with a VR filter down to a limit of 22.5 mag.",

            "text": "For giant planets, many questions remain, in particular, how are heavy elements delivered, what is responsible for ending their growth and how much interior mixing (\"core erosion\") is responsible for their atmospheric compositions. The strong and multiple indications that the interiors of giant planets -both in our solar system and outsideare not fully convective imply that inferences between atmospheric composition and formation scenario based on the (often implicit) assumption of full mixing are at best tentative. \n\nThe diversity of the giant planet population, the multiplicity of the mechanisms that led to their formation and their complexity imply that new observational constraints are required to understand their formation. Both extremely accurate measurements of the planetary characteristics for a limited number of objects and moderately accurate ones for a statistically significant population are needed. The possibility to measure accurate atmospheric abundances and bulk compositions on a large ensemble of exoplanets is highly awaited for. The gaps in our understanding of basic physical processes such as convection in the presence of compositional gradients call for an in-depth study of giant planets in our solar system. In that respect, Uranus and Neptune, which have never been visited by an orbiter, hold crucial clues to understand how giant planets and their planetary systems form. 38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,",

            "text": "In the past few years, the search for planets around other stars has moved from focussing on the biggest and easiest planets to find (e.g. [1][2] [3]), to looking for planets more like the Earth. As part of this process, the search for Solar system analogues has come to the fore, for a number of reasons. The first is purely practical -radial velocity observations of sun-like stars can only detect planets with orbital periods shorter than the time a given star has been targeted with observations. In order to discover a Jupiter-like planet, then, a given star must have been observed on a decadal timescale. For this reason, it is only in the last few years that the first true Jupiter-analogues have been found (e.g. [4][5] [6]). Furthermore, the discovery of smaller, more Earth-like planets, has required the development of more precise tools, as well as larger observational datasets. Once again, that search has only recently begun to bear fruit (e.g. [7][8] [9]). \n\nIn this push towards finding planetary systems that resemble our own, different techniques have brought complementary results to the table. The search for the smallest, most Earth-like planets, has been led by the Kepler spacecraft, using the transit technique (e.g. [7][10]). At the same time, the search for Jupiter-analogues has been led by direct imaging and radial velocity programs, which continue to find massive planets at ever increasing distances from their host stars. \n\nBeyond the simple practical reasons for the slow onset of the search for Solar system analogues, an additional and key motivation for that search is that finding planetary systems that truly resemble our own is critically important, particularly since it enables us to gain a better understanding of our own Solar system and its place in the universe. \n\nDespite the rapid progress made over the past two decades, technological limitations have, to date, resulted in very few exoplanetary systems being discovered that truly resemble our own. Possibly the prime example of such a system is that orbiting the star HR8799.",

It was found that the distance at which these accelerations coincide at the maximum acceleration from the 9th planet, that is, when the planet and 9th planets are on one side of the Sun on one straight line. At a farther position of the 9th planet, which is assumed by most authors, the acceleration from the Kuiper belt exceeds the acceleration caused by the 9th planet. \n\nSince in the aforementioned works, the total gravitational attraction of the Kuiper belt was not taken into account, we compared the perturbations exerted by the hypothetical ninth planet and the Kuiper belt. As parameters of the belt modeled by the discrete moving point masses (subsection 3.3), the values m = 0.02 m \u2295 , R 1 = 39.4 au and R 2 = 48.7 au were used. Various values of the 9th planet's distance from the Sun, R, were considered because the exact position of a hypothetical planet is not known. The results are shown in Table 8, where the distances R are given for the hypothetical planet, when the magnitude of the acceleration to the planet from the Kuiper belt and the perturbing acceleration from the 9th planet becomes equal. However, the TNO object -the Pluto-Charon system is was included into equations of motion for integrating together with the planets in the such ephemerides as DE and INPOP. So in this case, the neglected mass of the Kuiper belt becomes less (the 3-rd column of Table 8), and the distance where the equality of the perturbing acceleration from the hypothetical planet and the acceleration from the Kuiper belt becomes somewhat large.",

Unlike the formal definitions adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, group separation is obtained from measured physical properties of the objects. Thus, this classification scheme does not rely on orbital/environmental factors that are subject to debate\u2014the physical parameters are intrinsic properties of the objects themselves. Surface gravity g is the property that single-handedly differentiates (a) planets from all other objects (and it leaves no room for questioning the demotion of Pluto), and (b) the six largest (g>1 m s\u22122) of the large satellites from dwarf planets. Large satellites are separated from small satellites by their sizes and masses/densities, which may serve as higher-order qualifiers for class membership. Size considerations are also sufficient for the classification of (i) main-belt asteroids (except possibly Ceres) as small solar-system bodies similar in physical properties to the small satellites; and (ii) a group of large Kuiper-belt objects as dwarf planets similar in physical properties to the large (but not the largest) satellites in our solar system. The selection criteria are simple and clear and reinforce the argument that body shape and environmental factors need not be considered in stipulating class membership of solar as well as extrasolar bodies.",

            "text": "With the discovery of extrasolar planets during the past decade, it has now become evident that our solar system is not unique. Similar to our Sun, many stars are believed to be hosts to giantand/or terrestrial-class planets and smaller objects. In fact, as noted by Fischer et al. (2001), approximately 50 per cent of the extrasolar single-planet-hosting stars show trends in the residuals to their radial velocity fits implying that they may be harbouring additional objects.\n\nTo date, using the precision radial velocity technique, observers have been able to detect 20 of such extrasolar multiplanet systems. 1 Except for the recently discovered Earth-like planet of GJ 876 (Rivera et al. 2005), the planets of these systems are all Jovianor Neptunian-type. This can be attributed to the limited sensitivity of current detection techniques which implies that these systems may indeed be harbouring additional smaller objects.\n\nIf a small object exists in any of these extrasolar multiplanet systems, its motion will be affected by the dynamics of their currently known giant planets. Some of these systems have complex dynamical characteristics which can profoundly affect the existence of smaller objects. For instance, observations have revealed that a few addresses such issues focusing on four planetary systems of \u03c5 Andromedae, GJ 876, 47 UMa, and 55 Cnc. We choose these systems because, as mentioned above, they contain resonances, and/or resemble our solar system. We discuss the possibility of the existence of terrestrial planets around these stars and study the dynamical behaviour of small bodies, throughout these systems. We also investigate the habitability of these systems by simulating the dynamics of test particles in their habitable zones.\n\nStudies of this kind have been done for some of the systems considered here and/or for a few other extrasolar multiplanet systems (Jones, Sleep & Chambers 2001;Jones & Sleep 2002;Jones, Underwood & Sleep 2004aRaymond & Barnes 2005;Raymond, Barnes & Kaib 2006). However, what separates this study from the others is the choice of our initial conditions. In this paper, we present results that have been obtained by integrating these systems using initial orbital parameters that were determined by fitting their recent radial velocity data and by utilizing a newly developed fitting routine. This routine has been successful in the recent detection",

            "text": "Of the \u223c4,000 exoplanets known today (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu), the most common is a planet unlike anything in the solar system: larger than the Earth and smaller than Neptune (Petigura et al., 2013). These planets are described as being \"super-Earths\" or \"mini-Neptunes,\" where a \"super-Earth\" is described as a primarily rocky planet without a significant gaseous envelope, while a \"mini-Neptune\" is dominated by a gaseous envelope of either H 2 /He or water vapor. The description of the nature, structure, and evolution of such planets therefore is hindered by lack of a likely analogue in the solar system. Our solar system contains four rocky planets, each with unique surface, atmosphere, and dynamical history. Of these, the Earth stands alone, not just in the habitable state of its surface and atmosphere but also in its interior dynamics, expressed at the surface as plate tectonics. These dynamics are a complex function of bulk chemical composition, chemical differentiation, and formation history.\n\nExtrasolar rocky planets will also likely display a wide variety of surface characteristics and interior compositions. These planets represent a new frontier in geoscience: one where most constraints of planetary composition and structure need to be relaxed. In our search for \"Earth-like\" planets we must therefore characterize, however broadly, their geochemical and geodynamical states. This requires knowledge of the physical properties of materials under the relevant pressures and temperatures, which, in turn, is a function of the planet's bulk composition and mass. Insight into the composition of an exoplanet is most frequently gained through measurement of both mass and radius of the planets (the \"mass-radius relationship\") from which mean density can be calculated and a planet's interior composition might be inferred (e.g., Seager et al., 2007;Valencia et al., 2006). However, planetary mass is rarely measurable to precision better than 20%, and planetary mean density is degenerate with respect to relative proportions of metallic core, silicate rock, and H 2 /He atmosphere or H 2 O layer (Dorn et al., 2015;.\n\nIn order to account for this de",

Some problems of planet accumulation and migration of planetesimals, small bodies and dust in the forming and present Solar System are considered. It has been noted that the outer layers of the Earth and Venus could have accumulated similar planetesimals from different areas of the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets.The formation of the embryos of the Earth and the Moon from a common rarefied condensation with subsequent growth of the main mass of the embryo of the Moon near the Earth is also discussed. The influence of changes in the semimajor axis of Jupiter's orbit on the formation of the asteroid belt is discussed, as well as the influence of planetesimals from the feeding zone of the giant planets on the formation of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. The migration of bodies to the terrestrial planets from different distances from the Sun is considered. It is noted that bodies from the feeding zone of the giant planets and from the outer asteroid belt could deliver to the Earth a quantity of water comparable to the mass of water in the Earth's oceans. The migration of bodies ejected from the Earth is considered. The probabilities of collisions of dust particles with the Earth are usually an order of magnitude greater than the probabilities of collisions of their parent bodies with the Earth. The migration of planetesimals is considered in exoplanetary systems Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1. The amount of water delivered to the inner planet Proxima Centauri b, may have been more than the amount delivered to the Earth.

            "text": "A review of the results on the migration of celestial bodies in the Solar System and in some exoplanetary systems is presented. Some problems of planet accumulation and migration of planetesimals, small bodies and dust in the forming and present Solar System are considered. It has been noted that the outer layers of the Earth and Venus could have accumulated similar planetesimals from different areas of the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets.The formation of the embryos of the Earth and the Moon from a common rarefied condensation with subsequent growth of the main mass of the embryo of the Moon near the Earth is also discussed. The influence of changes in the semimajor axis of Jupiter's orbit on the formation of the asteroid belt is discussed, as well as the influence of planetesimals from the feeding zone of the giant planets on the formation of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. The migration of bodies to the terrestrial planets from different distances from the Sun is considered. It is noted that bodies from the feeding zone of the giant planets and from the outer asteroid belt could deliver to the Earth a quantity of water comparable to the mass of water in the Earth's oceans. The migration of bodies ejected from the Earth is considered. The probabilities of collisions of dust particles with the Earth are usually an order of magnitude greater than the probabilities of collisions of their parent bodies with the Earth. The migration of planetesimals is considered in exoplanetary systems Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1. The amount of water delivered to the inner planet Proxima Centauri b, may have been more than the amount delivered to the Earth. The outer layers of neighboring planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system may contain similar material if there were many planetesimals near their orbits during the late stages of planetary accumulation.",

While several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can successfully account for the observations remains elusive. In this work we show that the orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) cluster not only in argument of perihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such a clustering has only a probability of 0.007% to be due to chance, thus requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass \u227310 m\u2295 whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the distant KBOs, but whose perihelion is 180\u00b0 away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed orbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the presence of high-perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60\u00b0 and 150\u00b0 whose origin was previously unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and highly inclined outer solar system objects provides the opportunity for testing our hypothesis as well as further constraining the orbital elements and mass of the distant planet.",

While several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can successfully account for the observations remains elusive. In this work we show that the orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) cluster not only in argument of perihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such a clustering has only a probability of 0.007% to be due to chance, thus requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass \u227310 m\u2295 whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the distant KBOs, but whose perihelion is 180\u00b0 away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed orbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the presence of high-perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60\u00b0 and 150\u00b0 whose origin was previously unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and highly inclined outer solar system objects provides the opportunity for testing our hypothesis as well as further constraining the orbital elements and mass of the distant planet.",

Prediscovery images from 2001, 2002, and 2003 have allowed us to refine the orbit sufficiently to conclude that Sedna is on a highly eccentric orbit that permanently resides well beyond the Kuiper Belt with a semimajor axis of 480 \u00b1 40 AU and a perihelion of 76 \u00b1 4 AU. Such an orbit is unexpected in our current understanding of the solar system but could be the result of scattering by a yet-to-be-discovered planet, perturbation by an anomalously close stellar encounter, or formation of the solar system within a cluster of stars. In all of these cases a significant additional population is likely present, and in the two most likely cases Sedna is best considered a member of the inner Oort Cloud, which then extends to much smaller semimajor axes than previously expected. Continued discovery and orbital characterization of objects in this inner Oort Cloud will verify the genesis of this unexpected population."

This is necessary background information for understanding why there's a discussion about a 9th planet. Format: synthesis, as it needs to provide clear context.\n\n2. \"Planet Nine Hypothesis\" - This dimension would cover the scientific hypothesis about a potential 9th planet beyond Neptune, often called \"Planet Nine\" or \"Planet X\". Format: synthesis, as it requires bringing together multiple research perspectives into a coherent explanation.\n\n3. \"Physical Characteristics of Planet Nine\" - This would detail the predicted properties of Planet Nine based on scientific models. Format: synthesis, as these characteristics come from various studies and need to be presented cohesively.\n\n4. \"Evidence for Planet Nine\" - This would cover the scientific evidence suggesting the existence of Planet Nine. Format: synthesis, as the evidence is complex and interconnected.\n\n5. \"Alternative 9th Planet Claims\" - This would cover other claims about what might constitute a 9th planet, such as the Moon or Pluto's former status. Format: synthesis, as these are specific claims that need explanation.\n\n6. \"Current Search Status\" - This would detail the ongoing search efforts and why Planet Nine hasn't been directly observed yet. Format: synthesis, as this requires explaining the challenges and current state of the search.\n\nThis organization follows a logical flow from introducing the current official classification of planets, explaining the Planet Nine hypothesis, detailing its characteristics, presenting evidence for it, addressing alternative claims, and finally discussing the current search status. This comprehensive approach addresses the query directly while providing necessary context.",

                            "Recent analyses have shown that distant orbits within the scattered disk population of the Kuiper Belt exhibit an unexpected clustering in their respective arguments of perihelion. While several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can successfully account for the observations remains elusive. In this work we show that the orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) cluster not only in argument of perihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such a clustering has only a probability of 0.007% to be due to chance, thus requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass \u227310 m\u2295 whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the distant KBOs, but whose perihelion is 180\u00b0 away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed orbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the presence of high-perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60\u00b0 and 150\u00b0 whose origin was previously unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and highly inclined outer solar system objects provides the opportunity for testing our hypothesis as well as further constraining the orbital elements and mass of the distant planet."

                            "Recent analyses have shown that distant orbits within the scattered disk population of the Kuiper Belt exhibit an unexpected clustering in their respective arguments of perihelion. While several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can successfully account for the observations remains elusive. In this work we show that the orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) cluster not only in argument of perihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such a clustering has only a probability of 0.007% to be due to chance, thus requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass \u227310 m\u2295 whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the distant KBOs, but whose perihelion is 180\u00b0 away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed orbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the presence of high-perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60\u00b0 and 150\u00b0 whose origin was previously unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and highly inclined outer solar system objects provides the opportunity for testing our hypothesis as well as further constraining the orbital elements and mass of the distant planet."

Prediscovery images from 2001, 2002, and 2003 have allowed us to refine the orbit sufficiently to conclude that Sedna is on a highly eccentric orbit that permanently resides well beyond the Kuiper Belt with a semimajor axis of 480 \u00b1 40 AU and a perihelion of 76 \u00b1 4 AU. Such an orbit is unexpected in our current understanding of the solar system but could be the result of scattering by a yet-to-be-discovered planet, perturbation by an anomalously close stellar encounter, or formation of the solar system within a cluster of stars. In all of these cases a significant additional population is likely present, and in the two most likely cases Sedna is best considered a member of the inner Oort Cloud, which then extends to much smaller semimajor axes than previously expected. Continued discovery and orbital characterization of objects in this inner Oort Cloud will verify the genesis of this unexpected population."

This hypothesis proposes that the gravitational effects attributed to Planet Nine could be caused by a small black hole with similar mass, which would be significantly harder to detect through conventional observational methods.\n\nThe difficulty in detecting Planet Nine, regardless of its nature, remains a significant challenge. Astronomical models suggest that while the hypothesized planet should be detectable with current technology, the search requires scanning a vast area of the sky using large telescopes <Paper corpusId=\"257687575\" paperTitle=\"(Migaszewski, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This extensive search area contributes to the ongoing uncertainty about Planet Nine's existence and characteristics.\n\nA more unconventional claim comes from an analysis of the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) planetary definition criteria. According to one study, Earth's Moon technically satisfies all three requirements established by the IAU for planetary classification, despite the fact that the Earth-Moon barycenter (center of mass) lies within Earth itself <Paper corpusId=\"3352943\" paperTitle=\"(Russell, 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.
